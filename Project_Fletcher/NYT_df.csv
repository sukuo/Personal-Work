Professionally, Mr. Fahringer had no trouble visiting the sex parlors and viewing the pornographic films that he agreed to defend, although after seeing one, “Cake Orgy,” he remarked, “You’ll never eat a marshmallow pie again as long as you live.”

He insisted that, as Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler magazine, had put it, if privileged people could go to galleries and the theater, then the newsstand was “the poor man’s library or art museum.”

Defending Mr. Flynt in one of his several conspicuous run-ins with the law on pornography charges, Mr. Fahringer rose to address the jury, buttoned his suit jacket and paused to project deep thought.

“Freedom is only meaningful if it includes all speech, no matter who is offended by it,” he said. “It would be a hazardous undertaking for anyone to start separating the permissible speech from the impermissible, using the standard of offensiveness.

“The freedom guaranteed in the First Amendment is indivisible. You can’t take it away from Larry Flynt and keep it for yourself. The real issue of this case is: Are we afraid to be free?”

Mr. Flynt was moved to tears. The jury and the judge were not. Mr. Flynt was convicted and, in 1976, sentenced to seven to 25 years’ imprisonment. (He served six days; the sentence was overturned on a technicality.)

Herald Price Fahringer was born in Lewisburg, Pa., on Nov. 6, 1927. His father, Herald Price Fahringer Jr. (who later dropped the “Jr.”), was an oil company engineer and professional boxer. His mother, the former Pauline Dyer, was a homemaker. He graduated from Pennsylvania State University and the University at Buffalo Law School and served in the Army in Korea.

Two avocations would serve him well as a lawyer. At his father’s urging, he began boxing when he was 12. And after college, he briefly joined a theater troupe organized by Arthur Treacher, the English actor. He worked his way through law school by appearing in television commercials.

His marriage to Barbara Falk ended in divorce. For several decades he lived with his companion, Margaret Noyes, who died in 2007. No immediate family members survive.

In 1974, Mr. Fahringer’s representation of Mr. Goldstein, who was facing 60 years in prison on federal pornography charges in Kansas, resulted in a mistrial and an overturned conviction.

In the 1990s, his nonstop litigation forced a delay in the Giuliani administration’s efforts to shutter sex shops in Times Square unless they had limited their sexually oriented merchandise to 40 percent. Pressure from developers bent on gentrification was more difficult for him to overcome.

Mr. Fahringer represented Mr. von Bülow, the socialite accused of trying to kill his wife, Sunny, by injecting her with insulin, in Mr. von Bülow’s first trial. In one exchange with Mr. Fahringer, Mrs. von Bülow’s doctor said that he had suspected she was being poisoned.

Mr. Fahringer asked, “If you thought that anyone, during 1979 or 1980, was trying to poison Mrs. von Bülow, wouldn’t you have done something?”

The doctor replied: “You’re on a very sensitive subject, counselor. If you’re going to blow the whistle, you better make darn sure you’re correct. I cannot go to one of my patients and say, ‘I suspect your mate may be doing something harmful to you’ unless I have absolute proof. I could have a suspicion and not act. We have libel laws in the country, counselor. I can’t afford to make an accusation that I can’t back up in court.”

Mr. Fahringer countered, “But you don’t operate in court, do you?”

Mr. von Bülow was convicted, but won on an appeal that was handled by others. (Alan Dershowitz, a consultant to the appellate defense team, said that Mr. von Bülow had branded Mr. Fahringer “a martinet, allowing no debate.”)

Mr. Fahringer soon turned to an appeal of the conviction of Jean Harris, who had been found guilty of murdering her former lover, Dr. Herman Tarnower, author of “The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet,” in 1980. The case was lost, but her sentence was later commuted.

More recently he represented Lynne F. Stewart, a lawyer accused of providing material support to terrorists. Her 28-month term was extended to 10 years after she boasted that she could manage the original sentence “standing on her head.” In appealing the extended sentence, Mr. Fahringer argued that comments out of court cannot be punished by longer prison terms. He lost the argument, but Ms. Stewart was later released for health reasons.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr. Fahringer, appearing in federal court on behalf of a client, affirmed his fear of retiring.

“I have great trouble filling leisure time, so I eliminate it,” he said. “Working is easy. It’s living that’s hard.”","Herald Price Fahringer, a Defender of Free Speech, Dies at 87",2015-02-20,"The court victories of Mr. Fahringer, a lawyer who represented Larry Flynt and Al Goldstein when they were accused of distributing pornography, often reverberated beyond the individual client.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/nyregion/herald-price-fahringer-a-defender-of-free-speech-dies-at-87.html

They say the news media likes to dwell on the bad, swapping silver linings for dark clouds. And in this miserable year of the Islamic State, Ebola and Ferguson, Mo., there have been plenty of dark clouds for us to report about.

But Thanksgiving is a time to look at happier trends, and fortunately the flow of economic news has offered quite a few of those in 2014.

What are the five economic trends to be most thankful for this year? When I did this same exercise in years past, I had to turn to some obscure indicators to find five things to list. It was a lot easier this year, a sign that the economy really is getting better.

Cheaper gasoline and other fuels. One of the most important economic developments of the last several months has been a sharp decline in the price of oil and other commodities.

That is translating into cheaper gasoline, with average prices down 24 percent, or 89 cents a gallon, since late April.

Americans are also enjoying cheaper natural gas, fuel oil and electricity, which have common roots in the falling commodity prices.

This savings will tend to flow directly into other forms of consumption, much as a tax cut would. Every dollar not spent to keep cars filled up is available to buy something else, which is helping prop up spending and economic growth in the final months of 2014.

Gasoline Is Getting Cheaper National average price of regular gasoline per gallon $3.60 3.40 3.20 3.00 2.80 $2.82 May June July August September October November National average price of regular gasoline per gallon $3.60 3.40 3.20 3.00 2.80 $2.82 July November

Job growth. The nation has been adding jobs since 2010, but in 2014 the rate of that growth has taken a meaningful shift up.

Job Growth Has Accelerated in 2014 Year-over-year change in payroll employment 2.5m 2m 1.5m 1m 500k 0 2.6m 2011 2012 2013 2014 Year-over-year change in payroll employment 2.5m 2m 1.5m 1m 500k 0 2.6m 2011 2012 2013 2014

Employers added 2.64 million jobs to their payrolls in the year ended in October, compared with 2.2 million in the year ended in February. For years, the story of the economy has been one of steady improvement at a slow rate. But this year, the job market is showing genuine acceleration, which has helped push the unemployment rate to 5.8 percent in October, from 6.7 percent last December. The improved job market isn’t showing up in significantly higher wages for now, but there are some signs that may soon change, including …

More Americans are quitting. One of the more predictable consequences of the terrible economy over the last several years was that people who had a job were holding onto it for dear life. But in a sign that the job market is coming to life, the number of people quitting their job voluntarily has soared this year, even as the number being fired or laid off has remained low.

In other words, Americans appear more confident that they can find a better job than they did even a few months ago, giving them more freedom to escape terrible hours, an obnoxious boss or a too-low salary for something else. That could be a harbinger of workers having stronger leverage in pay negotiations in the months ahead.

More Americans Are Leaving Their Jobs Voluntarily The number of people quitting their jobs has risen sharply this year, even as relatively few people have been laid off or fired. 3m 2.5m 2m People quitting jobs Layoffs and discharges 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Sep. 3m 2.5m 2m People quitting jobs Layoffs and discharges 2006 2008 2010 2012 Sep.

Home prices are rising at a sustainable rate. This time a year ago, national home prices were rising at a double-digit rate. Had that continued, it could have easily led us into a new bubble.

The good news is that it didn’t continue. The Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas was up 4.9 percent in the 12 months ended in September, compared with more than 13 percent in 2013.

Home Prices Are Rising More Slowly S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 major metros, year-over-year percent change 10 5 0 4.9 July Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb. March April May June July Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec. S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 major metros, year-over-year percent change 10 5 0 4.9 July Oct. Jan. April July Dec.

That’s bad news for anybody looking to flip their house but is more in line with the type of home appreciation that is sustainable in the longer run — higher than inflation, but only slightly.

Also nice to see: There are big differences between different metro areas, with Miami-area home prices rising 10.3 percent and Cleveland prices rising 0.8 percent, with the rest somewhere in between. That’s a sign that prices are being driven by local market conditions, not broad forces of boom and bust like those from 2000 to 2013.

We may be done deleveraging. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have crunched the numbers on various forms of household debt and how they are evolving, and reached a welcome conclusion: American households appear to be done reducing their debt.

Across the major categories of debt, including mortgages, credit cards and the like, debt levels are now rising again. Not at the kind of rapid rates that would signal a buildup of major new risks, but decisively upward.

Total household debt levels are at $11.7 trillion in the third quarter, the economists write, up 0.7 percent from the third quarter but still well below the $12.7 trillion peak in 2008.

There are risks that accompany that — for example, those revealed by the reporting of my colleagues Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Michael Corkery on shady practices surrounding some subprime auto loans. But it also means that one of the big headwinds standing in the way of a faster recovery for more than five years may now be a thing of the past.",Five Economic Trends to Be Thankful For,2014-11-28,"Cheap gas, job growth, worker confidence, home prices and household debt offer positive signs for the future.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/28/upshot/five-economic-trends-to-be-thankful-for.html

HOUSTON — Oil prices plunged for a second consecutive day on Tuesday as commodity traders appeared convinced that a move by Saudi Arabia to cut its oil price for the United States will presage a price war by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

The benchmark American oil price broke below $76 a barrel during the day, representing its lowest level since October 2010, before recovering a bit. North Dakota and Canadian crude dropped even lower, and the slide stretched to the global Brent benchmark, which swooned to just over $82 — roughly a 30 percent drop since June.

The day’s 2 to 3 percent price declines for most crude benchmarks came as a reaction to a move by Saudi Arabia on Monday to cut its selling price for the American market by roughly 45 cents a barrel.

The effort was interpreted by many traders as a sign that Saudi Arabia will try to compete with American oil to protect its shrinking but still considerable market share in the United States.

The Oil Price Information Service, an independent gatherer of petroleum data, characterized Tuesday’s oil market moves as a “panic” in a report.

“Global traders are in essence voting on a referendum as to whether they believe that a price war is looming among OPEC and non-OPEC producers,” the service reported, “and for the moment, they are casting a ‘yes’ vote for the conflict.”

Consumers are already benefiting. The AAA auto club reported on Tuesday that the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline had dropped to $2.97, down 6 cents from a week ago, 33 cents from a month ago, and 28 cents from a year ago.

The average household in the United States consumes 1,200 gallons of gasoline a year, translating into an annual savings of $120 for every 10-cent-a-gallon drop in price.

Many industries stand to gain from the drop in fuel costs, particularly airlines, railroads, hotels and restaurants.

The oil and gas industry, which has been booming in recent years with the expansion of exploration and production in shale fields, stands to lose money, and company share prices have been dropping.

Hercules Offshore, an operator of shallow water rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, reported to Texas regulators last week that it would lay off 324 crew workers and down its operating rigs by four.

But that reaction has been the exception in an industry that continues to express confidence that it can expand production by another million barrels of oil a day over the next year.

Production in the United States increased by 70 percent over the last six years, reducing OPEC imports by roughly a half.

Among the most optimistic in recent days has been David J. Lesar, Halliburton’s chief executive, who insists that the recent drop in oil prices reflects a glut that is merely temporary.

“We believe industry fundamentals suggest that these lower prices are not sustainable,” Mr. Lesar said during a recent third-quarter conference call. “We believe that supply and demand will essentially be back in balance in a relatively short period of time.”

West Texas Intermediate, the American oil benchmark, settled Tuesday at $77.19 a barrel, down 2 percent.

Brent, the global benchmark, settled at $82.82 a barrel, down 2.3 percent.

Most energy analysts say that growth in United States oil production would be seriously affected only if the American benchmark dropped to $70 a barrel and stayed there for several months. That would force many small operators that borrow heavily to cut back, especially in less productive fields.

Where oil prices eventually will settle could depend on decisions made at the Nov. 27 OPEC meeting. Venezuela has called for a cut in production to shore up prices, but Saudi Arabia and other influential members have not suggested that is necessary.

The powerful Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, has been mostly silent and on vacation over the last month. He is expected to meet with Venezuela’s foreign minister, Rafael Ramirez, this week, and oil traders will be watching closely for hints of any agreement to cut output.

“Everybody is trying to get inside the minds of the Saudi royal family,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.

“They have the power to stabilize the markets, at least temporarily. The silence is being interpreted that they are intent on a production war, but it is incredibly premature to say that.”",Oil Continues to Plummet to 4-Year Lows as Investors Wager on OPEC Price War ,2014-11-05,"Saudi Arabia cut its oil price for America on Monday, sending the prices down.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/business/oil-prices-continue-to-plummet.html
3,"How quickly things have changed.

The past few years had been a boom time for the British oil industry and its thriving hub, Aberdeen, Scotland. With oil prices mostly stable and consistently above $100, companies were investing at record levels, willing to spend whatever was necessary to keep the petroleum flowing and to bring new resources onstream — even if it meant venturing farther and deeper offshore.

Even before the price plunge, though, the projected cost of some of the most ambitious North Sea projects was making some companies hesitant. BG, the British oil and gas producer, decided this summer to delay its main North Sea project, Jackdaw, when the projected price tag had risen to $5 billion.

Chevron likewise delayed a flagship development, Rosebank, in hopes of lowering the break-even point, which Goldman estimates to be $87.50 a barrel for it.

Now, with prices for Brent crude far below that level — at $60.44 on Friday — the economics of finding and developing those deepwater fields look more daunting. The British oil giant BP, a North Sea leader, recently sent letters to recruitment agencies in Aberdeen, saying it would have to cut wages up to 15 percent for any new oil-worker contractors.

The industry’s deteriorating economics threaten to accelerate the long-term decline of production in the British North Sea, now about 1.4 million barrels per day of oil and gas, as new projects are delayed and exploration budgets are cut.

Slim Prospects Only about one-fifth of the projected production from the 400 largest new and planned oil and gas fields around the world will be profitable if oil prices remain at $60 or below, according to Goldman Sachs data. Production in millions of barrels per day of oil equivalent 14 12 10 Economic viability of new oil and gas fields* 8 6 4 2 20- 29 30- 39 40- 49 50- 59 60- 69 70- 79 80- 89 90- 99 100- 109 110+ Price per barrel of oil to break even

Similar forces are playing out in other parts of the world.

A big cause of oil’s falling price, besides a slow economy in many parts of the world, is the previously high price. Years of $100 or more for a barrel of oil encouraged the development of oil from shale rock deposits in the United States, as well as other new sources elsewhere, resulting in big increases in the global supply.

A recent study by Goldman Sachs estimates that many large new oil and gas projects being planned around the world will not be commercially viable with oil at $70 per barrel.

“The shale revolution is making $1 trillion worth of new oil projects potentially obsolete,” said Michele della Vigna, a London-based Goldman analyst. “The industry needs to reduce costs by 30 percent to go ahead with these projects at the current oil price.”

If prices stabilize and then bounce back quickly, then the recent drop might soon be forgotten. But a sizable group of analysts say that rather than experiencing a passing blip, the market is undergoing a lasting adjustment to greater abundance of oil and muted economic demand.

In Britain especially, executives concede that production costs were allowed to run out of control. Overall operating costs in British waters increased by 15.5 percent, to 9 billion pounds, or about $14 billion, in 2013, according to Oil & Gas UK. The cost of producing a barrel of oil or gas has been rising at about 20 percent per year, to £17 per barrel.

Costs per field vary greatly. But 19 North Sea oil fields — about 6 percent of the total — now have costs of more than £30 per barrel, which puts them in danger of losing money.

No wonder companies are scrambling to cut costs. Conoco Phillips, the large American company, said recently that it would reduce its work force in Britain by about 230 people, to about 1,400.

Wood Group, a global oil services company based in Aberdeen, said on Wednesday that it would cut the pay rates for its 1,250 North Sea contract workers by up to 10 percent and freeze the salaries of 4,000 Britain-based employees. “These measures have not been taken lightly, but we believe they are required,” Dave Stewart, the company’s managing director for Britain, said in a statement.

Mr. Tholen of Oil & Gas UK said the fields in the most difficulty were in the northern part of the North Sea. These units, he said, tend to have old pipelines and platforms, which are costly to maintain, while declining production means there are fewer barrels and lower revenue to pay for the operating costs.

“If we have a sustained period in which prices remain in the 50s,” he said, “you can expect to see parts of infrastructure in the North Sea disappearing.”

The main deterrent to shutting down fields may be the high costs of closing wells and safely disposing of platforms and other offshore equipment. The industry spent £900 million on such decommissioning last year and is expected to spend nearly £15 billion more through 2023.

For the biggest companies, the best bet now may be to wait out the winnowing. With the billions of dollars in cash reserves, built up during the boom, they can probably afford to let the shakeout run its course — even if the North Sea will not necessarily be where they will put as much emphasis when things pick up.

They can figure that the prices of drilling rigs and related equipment like floating production platforms will be cheaper, as demand for the gear ebbs and they are no longer bidding against one another for the services of shipyards in South Korea and elsewhere.

“If you have a bit of cash” it will go much further in the future, said Malcolm Dickson, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “That’s one of the silver linings for the oil industry.”",Sinking Oil Price Is Hard on North Sea Producers,2014-12-20,The price plunge is forcing oil producers everywhere to recalibrate.

THREE RIVERS, Tex. — Whenever overseas turmoil has pushed energy prices higher in the past, John and Beth Hughes have curbed their driving by eating at home more and shopping locally. But the current crises in Ukraine and Iraq did not stop them from making the two-hour drive to San Antonio to visit the Alamo, have a chicken fried steak lunch, and buy fish for their tank before driving home to Corpus Christi.

“We were able to take a day-cation because of the lower gas prices,” said Ms. Hughes.

The reason for the improved economics of road travel can be found 10,000 feet below the ground here, where the South Texas Eagle Ford shale is providing more than a million new barrels of oil supplies to the world market every day. United States refinery production in recent weeks reached record highs and left supply depots flush, cushioning the impact of all the instability surrounding traditional global oil fields.

So oil prices — and those at the pump — are easing.With the Labor Day weekend approaching, the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.43 on Thursday, according to the AAA motor club, nearly a dime lower than a month ago. Energy and travel analysts project the lowest gasoline prices this holiday weekend of any Labor Day since 2010, and the highest level of motor travel since 2008.

“It’s a relief,” said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at GasBuddy.com, who estimates that American consumers collectively saved as much as $700 million a week through much of August compared with last year. “We can thank Texas, North Dakota and Canada.”

Nowhere is the boom bigger than in Texas, home to two of three of the nation’s biggest shale-oil drilling frenzies. While oil rushes are nothing new to the state of J.R. Ewing and Spindletop, the new bonanza has doubled the state’s crude production over the last two years, suddenly making Texas a bigger producer than either Kuwait or Venezuela.

The Eagle Ford field surrounding this refinery town is responsible for more than half of Texas’ new bounty. The production frenzy here and other shale fields in West Texas and North Dakota, all made possible by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, techniques that crack oil and gas out of hard shale rock with blasts of water, sand and chemicals, has lowered the country’s dependence on imported oil by more than a third in recent years.

Most of the price of gasoline is determined by the world price of crude, now hovering around $100 a barrel. Turmoil in major producer countries like Iraq and Libya does matter. But the new source of American energy means more supply has been added to global markets — almost the exact amount that has been taken off the market at times because of unrest in the Middle East and Africa over the last five years.

“If it weren’t for that, we would be seeing $200 a barrel oil or higher and $7 to $8 gasoline prices,” said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most aggressive producers in the Eagle Ford shale field. “It would be another shock to the world economy at a time when we don’t need it.”

Surging Ahead Production of crude oil by the U.S. has greatly accelerated, a trend that began about mid-2011. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION Top oil-producing countries as of first quarter 2014 Russia 10 million barrels per day Saudi Arabia United States 8 6 China 4 Iran Canada Iraq 2 0 ’98 ’00 ’02 ’04 ’06 ’08 ’10 ’12 ’14

The United States now accounts for 10 percent of the world’s oil production. As it sharply curtails imports from countries like Angola and Nigeria, those producers are then compelled to sell their oil to China and other Asian markets at steep discounts, compounding the impact of American production on world markets.

The change can be seen just down the road from the gas station here, where a pipeline that once brought foreign oil from the gulf port of Corpus Christi to Valero’s Three Rivers refinery has been reversed, sending Texas crude to other refineries along the coast for processing into diesel and other products for export to Europe, Africa and Latin America.

“Softening oil prices was inevitable,” said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, former head of exploration and development at Saudi Aramco, referring to the increase in American output. He added that “geopolitical turmoil has been a limited factor in recent weeks” largely because shifting conditions in “Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Ukraine have not actually disrupted any major oil export streams.”

Global oil markets only faintly resemble those of the summer of 2008 when oil prices soared to over $147 a barrel, the all-time nominal record, caused by a combination of unrest in Venezuela and Nigeria, a steady decline in United States production, and soaring consumption in China, India and much of the developing world. The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States hit $4.11 that July.

Prices quickly collapsed after the 2008 financial crisis, but had stabilized by 2011. One reason is that growth in demand for oil, particularly in the United States and Europe, slackened because of the weak economy and increasingly efficient vehicles. North American supplies continued to grow, while Saudi Arabia and Iraq increased production to compensate for the loss of Libyan supplies and Iranian exports pinched by Western sanctions.

Last summer, oil and gas prices rose for a time as President Obama considered an attack on Syria and disgruntled Libyan guards blocked major oil ports, but prices quickly retreated. Rising production in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Canada and especially the United States served as a cushion.

Again prices began to rise this year in early June, as Islamic fighters advanced in Iraq and tensions rose in Ukraine. Prices began to retreat again just in time for the Fourth of July weekend.

In a recent report, the AAA auto club predicted that prices would continue to slide through the end of the summer unless a major hurricane hits Gulf of Mexico fields and refineries, or there are other unexpected refinery disruptions.

Dangers remain abroad, of course. The terrorist offensive in Iraq has not yet touched the country’s most productive southern oil fields and exports so far, although future production is in doubt with Western companies removing personnel for security reasons. Sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine may impede Western financing and technology for future drilling in the Arctic. And while several Libyan oil ports recently reopened, militia violence is escalating.

But that hasn’t stopped Alejandro Alvarado, a restaurant cook in the town of San Diego, Tex., from appreciating the lower prices he is paying at the pump. “When you save on a gallon of gas, it helps pay for the cellphone bill,” he said while pumping fuel the other day. “It helps us buy school clothes and shoes for our four kids.”",A New American Oil Bonanza,2014-08-29,"United States refinery production in recent weeks reached record highs and left supply depots flush, cushioning the impact of all the instability surrounding traditional global oil fields.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/business/energy-environment/shale-oil-in-texas-keeps-gas-prices-affordable.html
5,"The price of crude oil has fallen roughly 25 percent since a peak in June, but whether that’s good news or bad depends on where you stand. It’s bad for members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other nations and governments that rely heavily on oil exports because their income has taken a huge hit. It’s especially bad for Russia and Iran, which have relied on high oil prices to defy the United States and Western sanctions. It’s bad for the environment because cheaper oil means fewer incentives to develop alternative and less carbon-intensive sources of energy.

But it’s not bad for Saudi Arabia, the kingpin of the global oil industry. Saudi Arabia has ample cash reserves to withstand a drop in income, shows no inclination to reduce production and seems to prefer putting a squeeze on its geopolitical rivals in Iran and Russia. For the United States, it’s a mixed bag. American oil production is soaring, and lower prices could slow production of shale oil, which is expensive and needs higher prices to be profitable. But lower oil prices mean reduced costs for consumers and businesses and a boost for economies across the industrialized world.

The large increase in American production is, in fact, one reason cited for the drop in prices. The other is a continuing slump in demand in Europe and other developed regions and slower growth in China. Characteristically, Russia has sniffed an American-led plot, with articles in the government press recalling how a sudden and sharp increase in Saudi production in 1985 caused prices to drop so low that the Soviet economy folded, followed by the Soviet state.

All that will make for some heated debates at the next scheduled OPEC meeting in November. But regardless of whether the oil ministers decide to reduce production and nudge prices up, the fact is that oil prices will always rise and fall in response to geopolitical crises, economic trends and natural disasters. For now, it is enough to see petro-dictators at least temporarily humbled and forced to understand that oil riches do not give them license to bend the international order to their will. And it is good for industrial and developing countries to get some juice into their economies.

But it is imperative that the United States and all other beneficiaries resist the temptation to use what could be a fleeting drop in prices to slow the search for alternative sources of energy.

The world has no shortage of interesting people who make a big impact without ever quite becoming household names, and lately we’ve seen a plentiful crop of picture-book biographies about some of them. Among several good recent examples are Jen Bryant and Melissa Sweet’s “The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus” and Jeanette Winter’s “Mr. Cornell’s Dream Boxes.” Both found a whimsical, child-friendly charm in the eccentricities of subjects few would have called ideal picture-book material: the neurotic Victorian Peter Mark Roget, who came up with the idea for the thesaurus, and the reclusive avant-garde artist Joseph Cornell, who innovated with assemblage. Two new ones are particularly welcome additions to the genre, for both their beautiful illustrations and their stirring stories: Each takes up the life of a 20th-century artist whose accomplishments are no doubt too rarefied to be already familiar to the average elementary schooler; but the subjects’ experiences growing up African-American in the segregated South, then making their ways through civil-rights-era America, give a natural storybook feel to their life trajectories.

“Draw What You See: The Life and Art of Benny Andrews” has the enormous boon of being illustrated with the painter’s own work. While Andrews, who died in 2006, illustrated more than 20 children’s books during his lifetime, all the pages feature other of his oil-and-collage works, mostly from his highly regarded series chronicling the struggles and dreams of African-Americans. Many have generous stretches of open space that work well on the page. Often, expanses of barely ice-blue skies form a noble, calm backdrop for his people, who are as textured and physically grounded as can be, many seeming stooped and burdened, or looking to the sky with almost violently craned necks. Every image has a magnetic intelligence that is hard to look away from, along with many small details of exquisite loveliness (a gorgeously complex floral pattern on a little girl’s dress, a tuxedoed waiter at a jazz club perfectly balancing a tray with two pink drinks on it). I suspect that many adult readers, and possibly some children too, will be tempted to flip through the pages of the book at least once before they settle in with the words.

Benson’s language is workmanlike, letting the inspirational facts of Andrews’s life speak for themselves. She shapes his story to emphasize the artist’s social activism and sense of mission, beginning the book with a page telling of his trip to New Orleans in 2005, the year before he died, to help children displaced by Hurricane Katrina use art to express their feelings. Then she backtracks to Andrews’s own childhood as one of 10 children of two sharecroppers. “Just about everyone Benny knew worked in the cotton fields, on farms owned by white people,” Benson writes, including the children most months of the year. But Andrews also drew whenever he could, and after he had suffered through years of sweaty, repetitive field work, his mother arranged for him to go to high school. He graduated, won a scholarship to a small black college, joined the Air Force and then went to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (“When Benny’s military service was over, the government offered to pay his college tuition,” as Benson cleverly explains the G.I. Bill to a generation being raised amid the widespread idea that all of their successful predecessors somehow managed to put together affluent lives without a lick of public help.)

There, Andrews was launched into the life of a sophisticated working artist whose paintings would be headed to galleries and museums. Yet he “liked to think of himself as a ‘people’s painter,’ ” Benson writes, and the book highlights his work helping “those who were often excluded by the art world” gain more visibility, along with teaching art at community centers and prisons.

“Leontyne Price: Voice of a Century” is also a gorgeous creation, Carole Boston Weatherford’s folksy yet lyrical narration combining with Raul Colón’s distinctive yellow-toned etched watercolors to give a sense of indelible grandeur to the life story of the pioneering soprano. Weatherford sets the scene of Price’s childhood cinematically, evoking the “misery” awaiting most black children on the Delta: “1927. Laurel, Mississippi. The line between black and white was as wide as the Mississippi River was long.” But inside Price’s home we see a dignified scene, with her conservatively dressed parents looking on at their only child adoringly and making sure little Leontyne “knew she was as good as anyone — black or white.” It’s a musical home, with opera on the radio Sundays and money saved up for a real piano and lessons, as well as a chance for Leontyne to see the great Marian Anderson perform, which “sparked a light” in her.

We follow Leontyne to college, where she expects to become a teacher, “the concert stage out of reach for a black singer then.” But her vocal talent and drive is recognized and encouraged, until she’s studying opera at Juilliard, then singing on a world tour that took her to La Scala and, finally, the Met, where she was among the very first African-American performers and received a famous 42-minute standing ovation, a detail sure to delight child readers.

Colón’s illustrations of Leontyne on stage are especially breathtaking, with his rendition of her as Cleopatra almost powerful enough to supplant any reflexive mental image of Elizabeth Taylor as the Egyptian queen. On the last page, Weatherford reminds readers that even at the height of her international fame, Price was still “just Leontyne, twisting all night long,” but I’m not sure that was necessary, since we’ve heard nothing so far about Price as a secret pop fan. I suppose one wouldn’t want children to get the impression that Price, who has been known to rock fur coats, pearls and turbans, is a snob, but isn’t there room in our pantheon of heroines for an actual diva?",Reaching for Beauty,2015-01-07,Picture-book biographies of the painter Benny Andrews and the soprano Leontyne Price trace their paths from African-American childhoods in the segregated South to international acclaim.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/books/review/draw-what-you-see-and-leontyne-price.html
7,"The decline in gasoline prices over the past four months has been sharp and surprising. But for Americans wondering why their family budgets still feel strained, part of the answer is almost as surprising:

Gas is not actually that cheap, at least not when compared with its level for much of the last 30 years.

At $2.03 a gallon — its current nationwide average — a gallon of gas is still more expensive than nearly anytime in the 1990s, after adjusting for general inflation. Over a 17-year stretch from the start of 1986 to the end of 2002, the real price of gas averaged just $1.87.

That era of cheap gas is easy to forget. Yet it offers a couple of important lessons about two of today’s biggest economic (and political) issues: climate change and the great wage slowdown.

Political leaders — from President Obama and Hillary Clinton to Jeb Bush and Scott Walker — have been signaling in recent weeks that they consider the wage slowdown to be the country’s most pressing issue. And it’s clear that energy plays an important role in it. The beginning of the wage slowdown roughly coincides with the end of the era of cheap gas, which is no coincidence. Energy costs are a major expense for most middle-class and poor families, taking a chunk out of their real (that is, inflation-adjusted) wages.

One of the surest ways to end the great wage slowdown would be for the United States to make sure it’s entering a new era of cheap energy. “It’s the proverbial tax cut,” says Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of the research firm IHS and author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of oil. If energy costs remain at current levels, it would put $180 billion into Americans’ pockets this year, according to Moody’s Analytics, equal to 1.2 percent of income and a higher share for lower-income households.

That’s why taking virtually every step to push oil costs even lower — “drill, baby, drill,” as the phrase goes — would make a lot of sense, so long as oil use did not have harmful side effects.

The most obvious way to hold down the price of oil is to increase its supply. The earlier era of cheap gas was made possible by technological advances that allowed for a surge of supply in the 1980s from northern Alaska and Europe’s North Sea. Mexico also became a major producer. The recent drop in oil prices, similarly, stems in part from supply increases in Iraq and Libya. Even more important has been the shale-oil boom (also known as the fracking boom.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The problem, of course, is that oil use does have side effects. It leads to carbon emissions, which are altering the world’s climate. Last year was probably the planet’s hottest since modern records began in 1880, and the 15 hottest have all occurred since 1998. Oceans are rising, species are at risk and some types of severe storms, including blizzards, seem to be more common.

More oil production, then, involves enormous trade-offs: a healthier economy, at least in the short term, but a less healthy planet, with all of the political, ecological, health and economic downsides that come with it.

Is it possible to get the benefits of more energy production without the drawbacks? Yes, at least in part. Fracking is less carbon intensive than conventional oil drilling (though fracking brings other dangers that need managing). Clean energy — like wind and solar — would be better yet, if it could become even cheaper.

Then there is the other side of the oil price equation: demand. A second reason that gas prices fell so rapidly in the early 1980s was the series of conservation efforts that followed the 1970s oil shocks. Fuel-economy standards, signed by President Gerald Ford in 1975, forced automakers to replace gas guzzlers with smaller, more efficient cars. Electricity plants began using natural gas or nuclear power in place of oil.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

The conservation didn’t last, though. Its success brought about its own demise. Low gas prices, for years on end, persuaded many drivers to give up their small cars. When the era of cheap gas began, in the mid-1980s, the Honda Accord, the Ford Escort, the Ford Tempo and the Chevrolet Celebrity — all modest-size — were among the country’s 10 best-selling vehicles. When the era ended, in 2002, the Ford Explorer, the Chevrolet Trailblazer, the Chevrolet Silverado and the Dodge Ram — all trucks — were among the best-selling.

Left to its own devices, the energy market will repeat this cycle. Low prices will cause supply to grow more slowly, both clean and dirty energy, and demand to grow more quickly. It’s happening already.

Sales of S.U.V and pickup trucks were 12 percent higher in December 2014 than December 2013. Car sales rose just 5 percent over the same period. As Mr. Yergin notes, shale-oil production will slow if oil prices remain where they are.

There is a whiff in the energy market of what Winston Churchill lamented as “the endless repetition of history.” Breaking that cycle certainly wouldn’t be easy, but it would be one of the biggest things that economic policy could accomplish in coming years: finding a way to cement a new era of cheap energy, one that’s more enduring than the last one and that doesn’t do nearly so much climate damage.

We are at least off to a decent start. Fracking (like nuclear energy) has the potential to increase supply without as much pollution. Wind and solar power have made major progress, though not yet enough in most cases to compete on their own with oil and coal. And the Obama administration, the current Chinese government and possibly the current Indian one are taking conservation more seriously than their predecessors.

The period of cheap oil that began in the 1980s wasn’t preordained. If anything, it was the exception to the modern history of energy. But the fact that oil has been even cheaper than it is today — and for years on end — does offer reason for economic hope.","Gas, Still Not as Cheap as It Used to Be",2015-01-27,"The price of gas, though down 50 percent since the summer, is still more expensive than it was for much of the 1980s and 1990s.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/27/upshot/gas-still-not-as-cheap-as-it-used-to-be.html

A 50 percent drop in the price of crude oil in a matter of months is a highly unusual occurrence. But that’s what happened from the beginning of July 2014 to the end of this March. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 5 percent in that period, but individual parts of the market reacted in very different ways.

Energy stocks, battered by worries about weaker earnings, followed the price of oil downward: Since last July, the S.&P. 500 energy index has lost 22 percent.

Then there are the big winners: consumer discretionary stocks. When oil prices drop, gasoline prices do too, and many consumers have more money to spend. Investors have bid up stocks of companies like Nike and Walt Disney on the assumption that people will be funneling more cash into such nonessential products and services as apparel and entertainment. And so, since July 1, 2014, the S.&P. 500 consumer discretionary index has increased 12 percent.

Among exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, the trend has been similar. For instance, the largest oil futures fund, the United States Oil Fund, or USO, has dropped 57 percent since July, while the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, or XLY, has posted a 12 percent gain.

Lately, some investors have been buying oil E.T.F.s in anticipation of an oil price recovery. In the six months through March, USO had a net inflow of almost $2.9 billion compared with an outflow of $216 million during the same period a year earlier. “When E.T.F. investors see falling oil prices, their response is to buy oil and bet that the average consumer is heading to Disneyland for a vacation,” said Matt Hougan, president of the analytical website ETF.com.

Those expectations could be thwarted by consumer behavior, however. Retail spending figures suggest that consumers may not be spending very much of their oil windfall after all.

If that continues, consumer discretionary stocks could fall out of favor. And at some point, the oil market is likely to trend upward.

HOUSTON — LATELY — very lately — I’ve started to enjoy driving by my neighborhood Kroger again. The boldly colored curbside sign has been showing an uptick in the price of gas in the last few weeks, from $1.75 a gallon to $1.91 to $2.11. In fancier parts of town, I’ve even seen it hit $2.50.

If I lived in Kansas or New York or California, this price rise would not be particularly good news. But I live in Houston — the energy capital of America, if not the planet — where even this tiny increase is cause for optimism. Maybe, I think, it won’t be so bad this time, “it” being the predicted downturn that always comes when oil prices start to teeter.

Despite well-intentioned talk by civic leaders about economic diversification, and by the oil companies about their “risk management” strategies, the inevitable highs and lows of the energy business continue to dominate my adopted hometown, not just economically but emotionally. Like a lot of Houstonians, I, for instance, have no personal stake in the business — no oil leases, no dividend coupons, no piece of a deal in Kazakhstan or even South Texas — but over the years I have grown accustomed to the dramatic highs and lows that cause tectonic shifts in this city’s identity.

I arrived in Houston during the oil boom of the late-1970s, when the Texas I had grown up in was only a few decades removed from backwater status. (Jett Rink, the rude, crude wildcatter James Dean played in the 1956 film “Giant,” based on the novel by Edna Ferber, did not spring entirely from her imagination.) But then, suddenly, skyscrapers by the likes of Philip Johnson and I. M. Pei started rising all over town. At Tony’s restaurant, local notables hosted everyone from Mick Jagger to Princess Grace to Ernest Borgnine. The University of Houston even started a creative-writing program, a sure sign of the end of hickdom if ever there was one.

No one cared that the freeways were clogged — frequently with émigrés from Michigan — and that the air was as soupy and sticky as Beijing’s is today, because we were all just biding our time until our well came in. And it would, of course, because oil, which had risen from around $10 a barrel in 1974 to about $38 in early 1980, was sure to hit $50. And then go even higher. Forever.

It didn’t. Instead, in the middle of that year, the price started trending in the opposite direction, thanks in part to OPEC nations that decided it was time to flood the world with cheap oil. By 1986 oil was selling below $20 a barrel, and the price slumped again after a slight rise in 1987.

These were grim times, not only for people who lost their jobs at oil companies and related service industries, but for the very rich, some of whom became all too familiar with “The Chapter” — as in the section of the bankruptcy code, not a novel. The most dunderheaded savings-and-loans went under, the officers having been a little too capacious in their lending. Local banks came under the control of national behemoths, trading hands so often that it became nearly impossible to keep track of the constantly renamed skyscrapers downtown. The see-through office building — an empty one — became a common sight along freeways. And of course there was shame and embarrassment — or, in Texas parlance, the thought that maybe we had gotten a little too big for our britches.","As Oil Prices Fall, Houston Shudders ",2015-03-01,America&#8217;s energy hub prays for the cost of gasoline to rise.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/opinion/sunday/as-oil-prices-fall-houston-shudders.html

GOOD news! Oil prices have dropped through the floor.

Or is it bad news?

That depends entirely on whose news you’re talking about.

For most of us, the most immediate impact of the price of a barrel of crude dipping below $50 is lower prices at the fuel pump. It wasn’t long ago that I paid more than $3.50 a gallon to gas up; during my visit to Texas over the holidays, I marveled at a gas-station receipt for $1.96 a gallon. I’m thinking of having it framed. Or maybe bronzed.

I’m getting a little teary here.

Today’s prices made filling up the tank — a big tank, because the rental agency upgraded me to an S.U.V. from the more economical car I’d asked for — something close to a tawdry thrill.

But great as that was for me, cheap oil isn’t good for everybody. For example, it’s part of what sent the Russian ruble into a tailspin. That, in turn, is bad news for Vladimir V. Putin. (Which many people would see as good news — a problem he can’t fix by jailing somebody or taking off his shirt. But I digress.) Many nations and states balance their budgets on oil revenue, and, closer to home, many stock portfolios invest heavily in the energy sector.

Tracking the pros and the cons of falling energy prices can give you a bad case of whiplash. For example, damage to energy industries’ prospects is good news to those who want to see us move away from investment in fossil fuels and hope to curb climate change. Yet low oil prices make renewable energy sources like solar and wind less attractive financially, making it harder to curb climate change.

On the other hand, the lower prices could also allow the government to finally raise the gas tax. After all, this tax finances highway construction, and it hasn’t been raised for two decades. But — ha-ha! — who am I kidding? We don’t raise taxes in this country.

Oh, it’s good to laugh.

Anyway, the situation may lead consumers to spend more, adding power to the economy. After all, cheaper gas prices can put hundreds of dollars a year into a family’s pockets. But if that happens, we could get inflation.

It’s good! It’s bad! Who knows?

The strangest effect of low energy prices is that for every dollar off the cost of a barrel of oil, American consumers seem to lose an I.Q. point. We turn away from economical, fuel-saving cars and go back to our beloved gas guzzlers, as if we believe low prices will last forever. That is the triumph of hope over experience.

Still, it can be liberating, throwing caution and common sense to the wind. It may be time for me to finally abandon gas sippers like the Smart and the Honda Civic and to buy the cars I’ve hankered for as part of my American birthright. So I’ve been looking into used Hummers. They make a real statement: A 2003 version of the humongous H2 was once said to get just 10 miles per gallon in the city.

G.M. announced in 2010 that it was discontinuing the brand — another sign that car companies are underestimating the guzzle lust of the American consumer. Even discontinued, Hummers have returned! The Washington Post reported that sales of used Hummers and other beasts have jumped as gas prices have fallen.

I could buy something even bigger — say, the kind of tour bus that rock stars use, with lavish quarters in the back for sleeping and partying. I missed my chance last year to buy one of Willie Nelson’s old “Honeysuckle Rose” buses, which sold for $80,000 — a steal, considering that you might get a contact high from the leftover pot smoke wafting out of the old upholstery.

But why settle for secondhand when I could buy something new? The Bugatti Veyron gets about eight miles a gallon in the city. At almost $2 million, however, it’s out of even my imagination’s price range. Instead, I could spring for a four-wheel drive Cadillac Escalade, some models of which get 14 m.p.g. in the city; starting at less than $77,000, they are so much more reasonable.

I could pay for one of those instead of, say, sending my youngest to college. After all, don’t I deserve the best? And if we’re not going to fix our highways or the environment, what kind of future is he going to have, anyway?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Here’s the problem, though. Once I start, I can’t stop. Why settle for a ho-hum Hummer when, if I really want to impress the neighbors, I can buy an actual military armored transport vehicle?

I spent time in Ferguson, Mo., last year, and let me tell you that nothing quite makes an impression like an MRAP — a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle — grinding its way down a city street. Yes, these monsters cost the military hundreds of thousands of dollars. But local police departments and school districts have gotten them for a few thousand bucks each — less than I paid for my Smart car — or even free. I’d probably have to claim to be a police department to get a good deal, but with all the money saved on gas, I can hire lawyers who can convince the government of anything.

And these vehicles are a prudent choice: There’s probably plenty of room in back for those big packages of toilet paper from Costco.

CLEARLY, there is money to be made from this thinking. I am not the only stupid person out there. I am not even a leading indicator of stupidity. If I want to consume conspicuously, plenty of others must be ready to consume not just conspicuously, but also flagrantly, even idiotically. Smart guys can profit from the excess of others.

Sure, you could be boring and look into energy mutual funds, on the assumption that things will turn up again sometime. But isn’t it better to bet on guzzling and consumption — to create a portfolio based on big honking vehicles and wretched excess?

Wall Street, this is your métier. Nobody knows excess like y’all do. Will you step up? Everybody talks about trying to get in on the smart money. But there have got to be even bigger profits on betting dumb.

16,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — The world’s top petroleum exporter, Saudi Arabia, said on Sunday that it would not cut output to prop up oil markets even if nations outside OPEC did so, in one of the strongest signals that it planned to ride out the market’s biggest slump in years.

Referring to countries that are not members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Ali Al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, told reporters: “If they want to cut production they are welcome. We are not going to cut, certainly Saudi Arabia is not going to cut.”

He added that he was “100 percent not pleased” with prices but said they would improve, although when was unclear.

He said speculators were responsible for the fall in prices to half their levels of six months ago and what he called a lack of cooperation from non-OPEC producers.

His remarks at a conference here in the capital of the United Arab Emirates were the second time in three days that the kingdom has signaled that it would not change output levels, preferring to allow the market to stabilize on its own.

His tone was echoed by some other Arab oil ministers at the conference.

The oil minister for the United Arab Emirates, Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei urged all producers not to raise their oil output next year, saying this would quickly steady prices.

The world is forecast to need less OPEC oil in 2015 because of a rising supply of shale oil from the United States and other competing sources, with no significant increase in world demand.

Ali Al-Omair, the oil minister of Kuwait said OPEC did not need to cut production and would not hold an emergency meeting before its next scheduled talks in June.

At its meeting, OPEC maintained its target output of 30 million barrels a day, leaving the market to balance itself without the group’s intervention.

That stance was seen as a shift from a longstanding policy in which OPEC powerhouse Saudi Arabia has acted as a swing supplier.

Asked about possible cooperation among OPEC members, which include the world’s lowest-cost producers, and nonmember countries, Mr. Naimi said, “The best thing for everybody is to let the most efficient producers produce.”",Saudi Arabia Vows to Ride Out Oil Price Slump,2014-12-22,"Saudi Arabia, which normally acts as a swing supplier, says that it will not cut production, preferring to allow the market to stabilize on its own.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/business/energy-environment/opec-saudi-arabia-oil-production-price.html

Both Iran and Venezuela rely on oil prices to drive their respective economies. Oil prices have plunged more than 55 percent since June to less than $50 a barrel, placing a severe strain on the two countries.

HOUSTON — The price of crude oil continued to collapse on Monday, plunging to a five-year low, as oil giants began to scale back their drilling ambitions and pare the ranks of their workers.

On the same day that the American oil benchmark traded around $63 a barrel, down more than 4 percent, ConocoPhillips announced it would cut investment spending in 2015 by 20 percent, the biggest sign yet that major oil companies are contracting.

The announcement came on the heels of BP’s notice that it would cut middle management and other jobs in the months ahead.

Both moves suggested that the 40 percent drop in oil prices since July had spread pain beyond small exploration companies that were highly leveraged and most vulnerable to oil price swings.

“We are setting our 2015 capital budget at a level that we believe is prudent given the current environment,” said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips’s chairman and chief executive.

But even with the sharp cut in investments, the company projected that its oil and gas production would grow 3 percent next year because of recent start-ups of major projects in Canada, Europe and Asia, as well as increasingly productive wells being drilled in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale fields of Texas and North Dakota.

That forecast, combined with the slow decline in drilling rigs deployed in fields worldwide, indicates that whatever hopes Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers have that lower prices will lead to quick production declines are unlikely to happen before late 2015. The cartel decided last month to keep its 12 members’ production quotas steady, in a move that accelerated the oil price drop.

Energy experts say that more production will most likely lead to even lower oil prices, unless the economies of Europe and Asia recover more quickly than expected or if there is a major new political disruption in the Middle East or North Africa.

Wall Street analysts continued to lower their predictions of where oil prices are headed in 2015, with some projecting that global oil prices could break below even $50 a barrel — the biggest collapse since prices briefly plunged by about two-thirds during the most recent recession.

“With OPEC on the sidelines, oil prices face the greatest threat since 2009 and appear to be on track for a volatile 2015,” Morgan Stanley said in a commodity report on Monday. But the report added that “oversupply is likely exaggerated and the market may be complacent about upside risks.”

So far, the drop in oil prices has been a boon for consumers. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.67 on Monday, according to the AAA auto club, 27 cents lower than a month ago and 59 cents below a year ago. Energy experts say that every 10-cent drop in gasoline prices translates into a $120 in annual savings for the typical family that consumes 1,200 gallons a year.

But economists say the full consequences of the oil price drop, while positive over all, are hard to predict fully. Several oil-producing states, including Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Alaska, are bound to be hurt since so much of their employment and tax revenue are based on oil and gas. Already in Oklahoma, monthly energy tax revenue in November declined from the year before by more than 5 percent, the first time there had been a drop in nearly two years.

And beyond the recent announcements of cutbacks, companies like ConocoPhillips are considering deferring investments in oil fields around the globe, especially in high-priced offshore and shale fields. The Norwegian oil giant Statoil has announced job cuts, and suspended or canceled rig contracts. Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron cut jobs in their North Sea operations even before oil prices plunged.

Precision Drilling, Canada’s largest oil and gas drilling contractor and a global player, announced Monday that it was cutting its capital spending next year by 44 percent.

Raymond James on Monday issued a report highlighting budget reductions of oil field service companies. “Peak to trough, we think the total U.S. rig count will decrease by 587 total rigs (or nearly 30 percent) by mid-2016,” Raymond James projected.

“In a low-price environment, investments are harder to justify,” said Michael E. Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. Mr. Webber added that what was happening had occurred repeatedly in the oil business over the last century.

“This is what commodity markets do,” Mr. Webber said. “They go to high price, and high price inspires new production and also inspires consumers to use less. After a couple of years of that, prices collapse. Then low prices inspire consumers to consume more and encourage suppliers to turn off production. Then you get a supply shortage and prices go back up.”

Globally, economists project that countries with high fuel import bills like Japan and China should benefit from lower energy costs. China’s trade surplus soared in November to a new high because of steeply falling prices for oil and other imported commodities. India and Indonesia have already been able to shave subsidies on gasoline to reduce their burdensome fiscal deficits.

But for oil-producing countries like Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria and Iran, falling oil prices threaten their government programs, currencies and ability to pay debts. Their political stability could also be at risk. Persian Gulf countries appear to be in better shape financially to withstand plunging oil prices, but future reductions in their sovereign wealth fund global investments could hurt some financial markets.

The drop in oil prices may even hurt natural gas exporting countries since gas prices are often tied to oil prices in European and Asian markets. Along with a projected supply surge between 2015 and 2019, lower prices could jeopardize several large proposed liquefied natural gas export projects in the United States and Canada.

The Malaysian national oil company Petronas last week announced that it was delaying a final investment decision on a $36 billion liquefied natural gas project it was leading in British Columbia.","Oil Falls to 5-Year Low, and Energy Companies Start to Retrench",2014-12-09,"Major oil companies are scaling back drilling plans and laying off workers, with prices off 40 percent since July.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/business/energy-environment/oil-falls-to-5-year-low-and-companies-start-to-retrench-.html
19,"Why did the price of oil drop in the first place?

This a complicated question, but it boils down to the simple economics of supply and demand.



United States domestic production has nearly doubled over the last several years, pushing out oil imports that need to find another home. Saudi, Nigerian and Algerian oil that once was sold in the United States is suddenly competing for Asian markets, and the producers are forced to drop prices. Canadian and Iraqi oil production and exports are rising year after year. Even the Russians, with all their economic problems, manage to keep pumping at record levels.

There are signs, however, that production is falling because of the drop in exploration investments. RBC Capital Markets has calculated that projects capable of producing more than a half-million barrels a day of oil were canceled, delayed or shelved by OPEC countries alone last year, and this year promises more of the same.

Recently, oil companies in Canada severely pulled back or stopped pumping altogether after a forest fire devastated the oil sands region. Production there dropped by a million barrels a day, roughly 40 percent of the area’s output.

Rebel attacks in Nigeria have also curtailed supplies in that region.

These fluctuations, however, may be short-lived.

On the demand side, the economies of Europe and developing countries are weak and vehicles are becoming more energy-efficient. So demand for fuel is lagging a bit, although there are signs that demand is growing in the United States.",Oil Prices: What’s Behind the Drop? Simple Economics,2015-01-13,"The price of oil has plunged in recent months, reaching its lowest point in more than five years.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/business/energy-environment/oil-prices.html
20,"HOUSTON — The global benchmark price for oil rallied above $60 a barrel on Friday for the first time in 2015, but analysts warned that growing stockpiles were hanging over the market and could easily force prices back down.

Traders bid up both the global Brent and American benchmarks about 3 percent after reports of moderately improving economic growth in Europe. An increase in oil demand in Europe, where the economy has languished, is considered essential for bolstering oil prices, which remain at their lowest levels since the economic downturn in 2009.

On the supply side, traders have gained confidence by the announcements virtually every day of oil companies reducing their investments in exploration and production as much as 40 percent.

The rig count in the United States has declined steadily since the beginning of the year to a nearly four-year low, as more executives have decided to leave oil in the ground until prices rebound.

The Baker Hughes service company reported on Friday that the United States rig count declined 84 this week to 1,056, from a peak of 1,609 in October. The latest major American producer to announce cuts was the Apache Corporation, which said on Thursday that it would cut its investments 60 percent this year. Apache said the number of rigs it operates onshore in North America would fall to 27 by the end of this month from 91 in the fall.

“We cannot predict nor control the length or depth of this oil price correction or the timing and extent of the rebound,” John J. Christmann IV, Apache’s chief executive, said in a conference call, reflecting the uncertain sentiments voiced by many oil executives lately. “We have therefore acted quickly and decisively regarding the things we can control: our activity levels and cost structure.”

The price of oil fell nearly 60 percent from June to late January. It began recovering somewhat in recent weeks as traders became increasingly optimistic that oil companies were quickly decommissioning rigs and cutting investments in exploration and production at a rate not seen since the oil price slump in the 1980s.

Gasoline prices have been edging up for motorists. The average national price for a gallon of regular was $2.24 on Friday, 12 cents more than a month ago. But consumers are stilling paying nearly $1.10 less a gallon than a year ago.

The question remains whether the cuts producers are making will be enough to bring supplies into balance with demand; the global market has an excess of 1.5 million to two million barrels a day. That oil has been flooding into storage tanks in Cushing, Okla., around the Gulf of Mexico and on tankers around the world.

The inventory of crude stocks in the United States alone reached a record this week of 413 million barrels, according to a report released on Friday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. And with onshore storage filling quickly, the bank estimated that by summer, 50 million to 100 million more barrels could be in floating storage on supertankers.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

At some point, unless global demand for oil suddenly picks up, producers will have no place to put their oil — forcing them to lower their prices and eventually stop producing.

“In our view, global inventory dynamics could continue to deteriorate in coming weeks, leading to renewed selling pressure in the oil markets,” the Bank of America Merrill Lynch report concluded.

But analysts are divided over when the storage tanks in the United States will be filled. Some say maximum storage capacity will not be reached until the middle of summer, depending on how much consumers take advantage of declining gasoline prices to drive long distances on their spring and summer vacations.

Oil production from new American wells fell to 525,000 barrels a day in January from 600,000 in May, according to a report by Rice University’s Baker Institute for Policy Study released this week. Still, overall production in the United States continued to increase, and government and energy experts estimate that it will take at least until the second half of the year for the growth in production to stop.

The Energy Department noted this week that American crude oil production was 9.2 million barrels a day in January and estimated that it would average 9.3 million barrels a day for the year. That is a steep decline in growth from the last three years, when average daily production rose at least a million barrels each year.

Brent crude settled on Friday at $61.52 a barrel, up $2.24, in London, and the American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, at $52.78, up $1.37, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.","Oil Prices Up 3% on News of Economic Growth in Europe, but Supplies Rise",2015-02-14,"Nevertheless, analysts warned that growing stockpiles could easily force prices down again.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-rise-3-on-european-growth-news.html

LONDON — Just as the oil market appeared to be stabilizing, the price of crude resumed its descent on Friday.

The drop, of about 4 percent, came after a report from the International Energy Agency warning that oil pouring into tank farms in the United States might “soon test storage capacity limits.”

The agency, whose reports are closely monitored by oil traders, said that overflowing storage “would inevitably lead to renewed price weakness.” American production of oil continues to increase despite recently announced cutbacks in new drilling by producers.

The price of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, fell to around $45 a barrel on Friday, while Brent, the international benchmark, fell below $55 a barrel.

The Department of Energy has proposed adding five million barrels of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The purchase, which requires congressional approval, would be added in June and July. But 9.4 million barrels of oil a day are being produced in the United States. Kevin Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners, said that the proposed purchase was not an attempt to support falling prices but instead “appears to derive from a statutory obligation.”

Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm, said that with winter coming to an end in much of the world, the oil market was most likely due for a spell of softness. Refineries in Europe and Asia will now be undergoing routine maintenance, leading to a period of weaker demand for crude. “We are expecting another period of weakness,” Mr. Mallinson said in an interview.

Additionally, striking refinery workers in the United States reached a tentative deal this week to end their walkout. Although the walkout affected 12 refineries, it had minimal impact on production as managers and other workers kept the plants running.

While prices rose to more than $60 a barrel for Brent recently, the fundamentals in the market had not changed greatly since oil prices hit multiyear lows in the early part of this year, the agency said in its report. The supply of oil from the United States, which has increased production by more than four million barrels a day since 2009 — more than the total output of either Iraq or Iran — shows little sign of slowing down, the agency said.

At the same time, Russian exports have been rising, and Saudi Arabia, the third of the world oil production leaders, increased output slightly in January and February.

The Saudis under King Salman, who succeeded his brother Abdullah in January, are not showing any signs of readiness to abandon their policy of maintaining production and defending their share of the market regardless of the consequences for prices.

Those low prices have helped lift demand for oil to higher levels than forecasters expected in places like India, Brazil and Indonesia. Even China, whose economy is widely reported to be slowing, is still lapping up lots of crude. Overall demand, which is up more than a million barrels per day over last year, according to Energy Aspects, has trimmed expected inventory builds outside of the United States.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Stronger-than-expected global demand helps explain the wider-than-usual gap in pricing between Brent, which is used as a reference in much of the globe, and W.T.I. With operators in the United States largely barred from exporting crude, the surplus barrels have nowhere to go, and inventories have risen to near record levels.

The price snapback did not materialize out of thin air. It was aided by the frigid weather in the Northeast United States, which raised demand for heating oil, and other factors like flows into commodity investment funds.

Still, seasoned traders were taken by surprise by the roughly 30 percent rise in Brent prices to over $60 a barrel since the six-year lows in January. When oil was scraping bottom, for instance, trading companies like Trafigura Beheer booked fleets of tankers to use as storage to take advantage of the steep spread between current prices for crude and those further out. With current prices having risen sharply, the trading companies have returned most of those ships to normal duties.

But now the mood is turning. “These props to the market are now starting to buckle,” analysts at Citigroup wrote in a recent note to clients. If the United States and other global powers manage to reach a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, for instance, that could clear the way for a big surge in Iranian production.

Iraqi production, which was disrupted by weather in February, has also come back. Exports from Gulf Arab states like the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also running strong, analysts say, aided by aggressive discounting of their crude.

22,"With the price of the global benchmark, Brent crude oil, falling 1.5 percent on Monday to $88.89 a barrel, many analysts said Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s dominant member, might be rethinking its strategy.

“Saudi comments indicate that it may have shifted from a strategy of holding prices at around $100 a barrel to a focus on market share,” said Jeff A. Dietert, head of research at Simmons & Company, an independent investment bank. “That means there is not an immediate floor on oil prices.” He said he thought that Saudi Arabia was trying to slow production growth in the United States.

Oil prices have reached levels not seen since the Middle East and North Africa turmoil began in 2011 because of an unusual combination of factors: Demand for petroleum products is declining worldwide, particularly in Europe, just as the global market is flooded with oil.

Many energy experts say the world market, which consumes about 90 million barrels a day, has one million barrels more than it needs, although that could easily change if the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, attacked Baghdad and threatened the southern Iraqi oil fields, or if militias suddenly renewed their blockades of oil ports in Libya.

Prices of Brent and the American benchmark, West Texas intermediate crude, have slid by 20 percent or more since early summer, when prices briefly spiked because of the Islamic State offensive in Iraq. The American benchmark dropped particularly hard over several days last week, suggesting a glut in several parts of the country, particularly West Texas, where production has been ramping up in recent years.

On the supply side, the United States shale drilling boom has been a critical factor. Domestic production has reached 8.7 million barrels a day, about a million barrels a day more than just a year ago and the highest level in nearly a quarter century. Imports from OPEC countries have been cut in half since 2008, forcing countries like Saudi Arabia and Nigeria to compete with one another in Asia, cutting their prices starting last week.

While the United States has been pushing up production month after month, so have other major producers. Saudi Arabia increased its production by 100,000 barrels a day in September, while Libyan production has increased in recent months by more than 500,000 barrels a day.

The Libyan production increase is because of an uneasy arrangement among regional militias that control the unstable country and central oil authorities to allow exports to leave the country. That flow could be interrupted any day.

Still, in its monthly oil market report released Friday, OPEC said that its members had produced 400,000 barrels a day of crude oil more last month than in the previous month.

Venezuela has called for a special OPEC meeting to deal with the price drop, while Iranian officials have called for production cuts. But Saudi Arabia is the crucial voice in the group; OPEC is responsible for roughly a third of global production.

“If the price stabilizes around here, it’s probable the Saudis will argue to wait until the November meeting when OPEC can cut the output quotas for the first quarter of 2015,” said Michael C. Lynch, president of the Strategic Energy and Economic Research consultancy and an occasional adviser to OPEC.

On the demand side, the thirst for oil is declining in Europe, where unemployment and industrial activity is down, and Japan, where the use of oil by utilities is being replaced by natural gas and coal. Restarting Japan’s nuclear plants next year will probably cut oil demand further, according to the United States Energy Department.

Last week the Energy Department reported that oil consumption in the industrialized countries was down 200,000 barrels a day this year compared with last year. The government expects American consumption, which increased by nearly 500,000 barrels a day in 2013, to decline by 40,000 barrels a day this year.

The decline in oil prices has not yet had a measurable impact on oil production, but energy experts say long-term exploration investment planning could be affected if the price decline is steep and lasting enough. Large companies like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron make their investment plans years in advance, but smaller independent companies can be more sensitive to price swings.

“The shale plays in the U.S. will become noneconomic at W.T.I. of $80 or so,” said Ed Hirs, managing director of Hillhouse Resources, an oil and gas exploration company, referring to the American benchmark price, currently around $85 a barrel.

Other analysts say investments will not stop dropping in an important way until the United States benchmark falls to $70 or even $60, since drilling has become increasingly efficient because of improved technology.",OPEC Split as Oil Prices Fall Sharply,2014-10-14,"The drop comes as demand for petroleum is declining worldwide and the market is flooded with oil, including increased production in the United States.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-fall-as-opec-members-fight-for-market-share.html
23,"HOUSTON — The American benchmark price for crude oil broke the symbolically important $60 a barrel mark on Thursday for the first time in over five years, underscoring a remarkable drop of over 40 percent since early June.

It was accompanied by another steep decline in gasoline prices, with the AAA motor club reporting that the national average for a gallon of regular gas on Thursday fell to $2.62, nearly two cents below the day before. After dropping nearly a penny a day over the last month, the average price for a gallon of regular is about 64 cents lower than a year ago.

The immediate cause for the continuing collapse in oil prices was a comment by the Saudi oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi, in Lima, Peru, on Wednesday that suggested that the OPEC cartel was not likely to change anytime soon its decision last month to leave production quotas unchanged.

“Why should I cut production?” Mr. Al-Naimi said.

Saudi officials have projected that oil prices would drop to about $60. The United States benchmark, known as West Texas Intermediate, is just above $59 and the Brent international benchmark is below $64. Some Wall Street analysts have predicted crude could trade below $50 in the coming weeks.

The collapse in prices has led to a rising tide of oil company announcements this week of investment cuts for 2015. Oasis Petroleum of Houston, an important producer in North Dakota’s Bakken shale field, said it would slash its drilling budget from $1.4 billion to $750 million.

Goodrich Petroleum, another company based in Houston with production in Texas and Louisiana shale fields, announced it would cut its 2015 drilling budget from more than $325 million to between $150 million and $200 million.

Many of the largest oil companies have also said they will cut their investments and lay off some employees, but most are projecting higher production in both their shale fields and in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Lower oil and gasoline prices should help consumers, particularly those in the lower income brackets who generally drive older, less efficient cars and whose energy costs represent a larger proportion of their incomes.

But many here in Texas remember the oil price bust in the 1980s that crushed the state economy, leading to high unemployment in the petroleum fields and bank failures.

HOUSTON — The Energy Department predicted on Tuesday that motorists would pay the lowest prices at the pump this summer since 2009, even though falling global oil prices have gained back some ground in recent days.

In its short-term energy forecast, the department calculated that the average national price for regular gasoline in the April-through-September summer driving season would be $2.45 a gallon, compared with $3.59 a gallon over the same period last year.

The average American household is expected to spend about $700 less on gasoline in 2015 compared with 2014, according to the report, and annual vehicle fuel expenditures are on track to fall to their lowest in 11 years.

The lower gasoline prices should encourage families to take to the road for their vacations, helping hotels, restaurants and amusement parks as well as refiners and gasoline stations. Lower-income consumers, who pay a relatively higher percentage of their incomes on energy than more affluent people, will benefit the most from the lower prices.

“Gasoline consumption this summer is expected to be up 2 percent from last year to the highest level in five years,” said Adam Sieminski, head of the department’s Energy Information Administration, “as higher employment and lower pump prices encourage more driving.”

The rising consumption represents a break with recent years, when more fuel-efficient vehicles and a weak job market reduced fuel consumption.

Oil and gasoline prices peaked last June and July during the surprise offensive by Islamic State militants that threatened Iraq’s oil fields, but oil prices have declined by roughly 50 percent since then. Gasoline prices fell somewhat less because taxes per gallon remained steady. Slumping prices fell with increasing rapidity after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries declined to cut production last November in the hope of forcing American oil producers to ease their drilling frenzy of recent years.

Since early January, oil and gasoline prices have been bouncing around a relatively narrow band, and there are tentative signs that petroleum prices may have bottomed. On Tuesday, the American benchmark gained more than 3 percent, to nearly $54 a barrel; it was the second day of robust gains.

Saudi Arabia, the biggest global exporter, has raised prices two months in a row in Asia as demand there has recovered. American producers have decommissioned half their rigs since last year, and the rise in domestic production is beginning to slow. Until recently, many analysts predicted that American oil storage capacity would soon reach its limit, forcing fuel prices even lower, but increasing gasoline and diesel demand now appears to be easing the glut.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Gasoline prices have been fairly stable over the last month after falling fast since last fall. The average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Tuesday was $2.38, according to the AAA motor club, 3 cents below a week ago and 7 cents below a month ago. The average price a year ago was $3.57 a gallon.

Most global oil benchmark prices had fallen to nearly $40 a barrel in early January, but they are now comfortably above $50 a barrel. Brent crude, the leading world benchmark, is now approaching $60, although few analysts say it will climb back above $100 a barrel anytime soon.

The Energy Department report predicted that the Brent benchmark would average $59 in 2015 and $75 in 2016. The American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, is expected to be $7 lower than Brent this year and $5 lower next year. At those prices, most drilling in the United States will be profitable next year, though the profits of most oil companies will remain muted compared to those of recent years.

The report suggested that a successful conclusion to the nuclear talks with Iran could bring oil prices down even further, by $5 to $15 a barrel in 2016.

“A lifting of sanctions against Iran,” Mr. Sieminski said, “could significantly change the forecast for oil supply, demand and prices by allowing a significantly increased volume of Iranian barrels to enter the market.”

The report noted that Iran could have at least 30 million barrels in storage, and it probably has the technical ability to raise production by at least 700,000 barrels a day by the end of 2016. But it added that the pace of Iran’s return to the global marketplace would have to be determined by negotiations and Iran’s compliance with the terms of an eventual agreement.","Low Gasoline Prices Will Continue This Summer, Government Says",2015-04-08,"An Energy Department forecast says that drivers this summer will pay the lowest prices since 2009, even though oil prices have stabilized.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/business/energy-environment/low-gasoline-prices-will-continue-this-summer-government-says.html

Oil prices fell to six-year lows on Monday in the face of concerns that a glut in the United States was outpacing already-brimming storage facilities.

Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries published a report suggesting that the cartel remained reluctant to intervene to prop up prices.

The direction of oil prices, which had risen sharply from January lows, has fallen back in recent days. Traders are now focused on the second quarter of the year, when demand for oil is traditionally weak because of the end of winter and scheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance.

On Monday, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the main United States benchmark, fell about 2 percent to about $44 a barrel, a six-year low, while Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell by about 2 percent to about $53 a barrel.

Oil markets continue to focus on OPEC because its members could quickly alter the markets’ balance by cutting production. But while some members, including Nigeria and Venezuela, would like to see cuts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies show little inclination to change the policy they agreed to in the fall: Protect market share regardless of what happens to prices.

While OPEC’s competence at managing the market was always much in question, the organization’s decision to stay on the sidelines has opened the way for volatile price movements.

In the view of market participants, OPEC’s role as the swing producer has moved to the United States and, in particular, to the producers of oil from shale rock. These companies have helped increase American production by more than four million barrels a day since 2009, far more than the combined increases in the rest of the world.

Many analysts say that with low prices discouraging investment in drilling, production growth in the United States will level off and even begin to decline. But when this change will happen is a matter of speculation.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

A group of oil companies working in Texas and North Dakota and elsewhere is far different from the gatherings of OPEC oil ministers that decide whether to cut or increase supply at meetings in Vienna.

“A new math for oil has emerged,” said Bhushan Bahree, an analyst at IHS Energy, a business information company in Washington. “The new math is the mix of variables that shape the pace and level of U.S. oil production as well as investment in high-cost sources of supply.”

Mr. Bahree said that while the market was trying to find a new equilibrium, “it is likely to flounder in the search for a new price range.”

OPEC made its own guess about when production might begin declining in the United States in its monthly oil report, published on Monday. Asserting that the output of a typical shale well can fall by 60 percent annually and noting the continued decline in the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States, OPEC suggested that “a drop in production can be expected to follow, possibly by late 2015.”

While that might seem like encouraging news to oil producers, it also means that OPEC, or at least Saudi Arabia, may be in no hurry to cut production at the group’s next meeting, in June.

The Saudis argue that over time, economics will work in their favor because their oil costs a few dollars a barrel to produce, while oil from shale, deepwater wells and Canadian oil sands is much more expensive. The Saudis also contend that any move to prop up prices now will encourage more investment in production in the United States and elsewhere.

In a speech on Sunday in Doha, Qatar, Ibrahim al-Muhanna, an adviser to the Saudi oil minister, also seemed to counsel patience. “We have a long-term view, and we do not make knee-jerk reactions to headlines,” he said, according to a text of his speech.

Mr. al-Muhanna said he was confident that demand from a strong global economy would prove sufficient to soak up supplies and that “prices will firm up.”

OPEC’s report on Monday was less sanguine. The group forecast that demand for its crude would average about 29.2 million barrels a day in 2015. That is about 800,000 barrels a day less than OPEC said it was producing in February.",U.S. Oil Prices Fall to Six-Year Low,2015-03-17,"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries remains reluctant to prop up prices, saying that American production should level off.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/business/international/glut-of-oil-pushes-us-crude-prices-to-6-year-low.html
26,"Apart from the benefits for consumers, previous bouts of low oil prices turned out to be great for stock prices, with the exception of the energy sector. In 1986, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 18.67 percent in a bull run that lasted until the recession of 1991. In 1998, the index rose 25.58 percent and 21 percent the year after. And even though stocks collapsed in 2008, they staged a huge rally in 2009.

One caveat is that cheap oil may lead to pockets of excess. A year after the 1986 plunge, in October 1987, the stock market crashed on what became known as Black Monday, though it soon recovered. The two years after the 1998 drop led to the peak of the technology bubble, which popped in March 2000. Some pundits are now warning of new asset bubbles in the making.

This year’s price decline is most nearly analogous to 1986, Dr. Yergin said. Oil price plunges in 1998 and 2008 were set off by unexpected financial crises — the failure of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management and the Asian debt crisis in 1998, and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession. In 1986, a surge in new supplies from the North Sea and Alaska, areas beyond the influence of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, drove down prices.

This year, the precipitating factor has been the waning of threats of disruption from Russia and the Middle East, slowing economies in Europe and Asia and, above all, a surge in production from the United States and Canada. “This time, the innovation is fracking,” said Philip Verleger, president of an energy consulting firm and former director of the Office of Energy Policy in the Treasury Department. “The sudden surge in U.S. oil production has profoundly changed the dynamics of the markets. The oil exporters have lost a third of the market they thought they’d have in 2014.”

OPEC met on Thanksgiving, but shocked markets when its members didn’t even pay lip service to the need for production cuts or price discipline. The price of oil, traded on international markets, fell about 6.5 percent that day. “Their strategy is to let prices fall and squeeze out the higher-cost producers,” Mr. Verleger said. “It’s a battle for market share.”

Low oil prices aren’t an unmitigated blessing for the United States, since it’s now the world’s largest oil producer and may soon emerge as an oil exporter. OPEC’s strategy may be to let prices fall to a point where North American shale and tar sands production cease to be economically viable. “But that’s a dangerous game,” Mr. Cinquegrana said. “The shale producers keep lowering their costs of production thanks to technology.” Even Saudi Arabia needs $98-a-barrel oil to balance its budget, estimated Edward Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets.

For Saudi Arabia and other major oil-producing countries, “oil production and exports are a primary source of government revenues,” Mr. Morse wrote in a recent research report. “The oil prices required for oil revenues to balance government budgets are far higher than the $70-90 range, with several countries requiring oil prices of well above $100.”

He estimates Venezuela needs $161-a-barrel oil to break even this year after decades of cronyism and mismanagement of its energy sector under the leftist government of Hugo Chávez. “Venezuela is a world-class example of economic mismanagement,” Dr. Yergin noted. Oil prices below $80 a barrel “will be devastating.”

And then there’s Russia, which acknowledged this week that its economy had fallen into recession as a result of Western penalties over Ukraine and falling oil revenue. Over half of Russia’s national budget is financed by oil and gas revenue. This week, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, canceled Russia’s long-sought gas pipeline to Europe through Bulgaria and Serbia, which would have bypassed Ukraine.

Both Mr. Putin and Mr. Chávez came to power in the wake of economic turmoil brought on by the plunging oil prices in 1998. Mr. Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin in 1999 after Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt. He vowed to restore Russia’s financial credibility and modernize its economy. Whether the latest oil price plunge and recession have any impact on his geopolitical adventurism remains to be seen. Mr. Chávez was elected in 1998 in the face of social unrest and falling oil revenue after OPEC imposed cuts in output.

Both Mr. Putin and Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez’s successor, have been vocal critics of the United States. Two other nemeses of the United States — Iran, which gets half its budget revenue from oil exports, and the militant group ISIS, which finances much of its activity from oil sales — will also suffer from low prices. The geopolitical consequences of low oil prices seem so aligned with the United States’ foreign policy interests that “some conspiracy theorists are saying that the U.S. and the Saudis want to punish the Russians and Iran,” Mr. Cinquegrana said.

Moreover, two of the world’s largest emerging economies — China and India — are net energy importers, and their economies should benefit from low prices.

History suggests there will be far-reaching consequences from the latest plunge. “You have to keep your eye on potential social and political unrest,” Dr. Yergin said. “We’re just at the beginning of this cycle, and there are likely to be unforeseen consequences. But for the global economy as a whole, my view is this is very positive. Cheaper gas prices in November mean more money in cash registers in December.”",Steep Slide in Oil Prices Is Blessing for Most,2014-12-06,"If history is any guide, it&#8217;s hard to see falling oil prices as anything but good news for everyone whose fortunes aren&#8217;t tied to oil.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/business/slide-in-oil-prices-is-mostly-a-blessing.html
27,"Short performance records mean that investors will not be able to see, for example, how a fund held up during a bear market like that of the 2008-9 financial crisis, he said. What’s more, frontier mutual funds and E.T.F.s are as varied as the countries they invest in. Some buy only in the frontier markets, while others also hunt in smaller emerging markets like Peru and the Philippines, he said. Some also layer on companies that are listed in the developed world but operate mostly in frontier countries.

Even index-tracking E.T.F.s can vary surprisingly, Mr. Rosenbluth said. Witness the iShares MSCI Frontier 100 E.T.F. versus the Guggenheim Frontier Markets E.T.F. The top three country stakes in the iShares E.T.F. are stocks in Kuwait, Argentina and Nigeria, while the top three in the Guggenheim offering are Chile, Argentina and Colombia, with Chile accounting for a hefty 41 percent of the assets. (MSCI, the index provider for iShares, classifies Chile and Colombia as emerging markets, not frontier markets.)

“I can’t come up with two things with the same name that could be any more different than these two E.T.F.s,” Mr. Rosenbluth said.

Many frontier countries have been enjoying something of a peace dividend, said Mr. Bell at T. Rowe Price. A generation ago, quite a few were seized by some sort of conflict: civil war in Sri Lanka, border battles between Pakistan and India, the bloody breakup of the former Yugoslavia. “About 50 countries in the ’90s had conflicts,” he said. “Today, there are about 10. When there’s not conflict, investment and economic growth can happen.”

PART of the appeal of frontier markets is diversification. The countries tend to be insulated from the ups and downs of the developed world and even from one another, said Pradipta Chakrabortty, manager of the Harding Loevner Frontier Emerging Markets Portfolio. “Take two countries in the same region — Nigeria and Kenya,” he said. “Nigeria sold off last year, but Kenya was up about 30 percent. This is different from developed markets. They pretty much move in the same direction.”

Professional investors often track whether groups of stocks rise and fall in tandem — whether their returns are correlated. They aim to combine groups that zig and zag independently, thus damping the volatility of a portfolio’s average return. Frontier markets are not closely correlated with the others, and that can be an advantage: A study published in 2013 in The Journal of Portfolio Management found that adding a frontier E.T.F. to a portfolio diversified across developed and emerging markets achieved that.

“If you look at the individual countries, frontier markets are risky,” said Kuntara Pukthuanthong, one of the study’s authors and a finance professor at the University of Missouri. “But when you build a diversified portfolio, because the market integration of frontiers with the other markets is lower, the risk of the whole portfolio is lower.”

Another element of the frontier markets’ appeal is their economic potential. “The growth in the future should be in these markets,” said Laura E. Geritz, manager of the Wasatch Frontier Emerging Small Countries fund. “A lot of that stems from demographics — the populations are young — and cheap labor costs. To me, an ideal frontier market is a low-G.D.P.-per-capita country like those in Africa and less-developed Asia, as well as Ecuador and Cuba.”

Yet there is no guarantee that economic growth will translate into investment wealth. Vanguard’s studies have found little correlation between growth and stock-market returns, said Christopher B. Philips, who leads the client service team for the institutional investment group at Vanguard.

“There should be a long-term link, but in the shorter term, the relationships are zero,” he said. “In China, for example, we found that despite its strong growth, it has had a zero percent total return of its equity markets since inception.”

Mr. Philips did not know why the hoped-for relationship had not arisen. He speculated there might be a disconnect between stocks and the broader economies. “The securities you can invest in differ from the drivers of the economy,” he said. In Nigeria, for example, oil propels much of the growth, but state-run companies and foreign multinationals control much of the production.

Even with the increased attention and investment, frontier markets continue to present unique risks, especially of political upheaval. Nigeria, for example, has faced an insurgency in its northern reaches, led by the militant group Boko Haram, while Argentina has feuded with United States courts and creditors over its default on sovereign debt. “Every frontier market has its idiosyncratic risks — politics, reliance on a single commodity, or currencies,” said Jay A. Jacobs, a research analyst with Global X Management Company, sponsor of the Global X Next Emerging and Frontier E.T.F.

Even basic data on companies in some of these markets can be difficult to find. Taizo Ishida, lead manager of the Matthews Emerging Asia fund, recalls being surprised at the scarcity of information when he first visited Bangladesh four years ago, but he says the situation has improved. “Now I can see information on the companies,” he said. “That gives me more confidence.” Partly as a result, Bangladesh represents the fund’s biggest country stake — 13.9 percent on Dec. 31.

Adam J. Kutas, manager of Fidelity Investments’ Latin America fund and its Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa fund, said he saw the frontier markets as analogous to small-capitalization stocks in the developed world — riskier than large caps and midcaps but worth including in a diversified basket of investments.

“Frontiers shouldn’t be your core investment,” he said. “But they can give you higher return potential and reduce the volatility in a portfolio.”",Rushing to Stake a Claim on the Market Frontier,2015-04-12,"While they may not be ideal, markets in countries on the outer edges of publicly traded investments can provide returns and diversification.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/business/mutfund/venturing-even-further-on-the-market-frontier.html

Oil prices continued their collapse on Friday as evidence mounted that the frenzy of American oil production would continue well into 2015 even while growth in global demand was declining.

The swoon in oil prices led to a steep decline in equities, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closing lower by 1.6 percent, to 2,002.33, as investors feared that the declining energy demand meant that the global economy was slowing.

“People are scared that the drop in oil demand is the first leg down for the global economy that had been led by the growth in the emerging markets,” said Nancy T. Schmitt, president of Taum Sauk Investments. “That growth has evaporated. The demand has gone away, and we are seeing it first with oil prices.”

The global benchmark for crude approached $60 a barrel — down more than 3 percent on the day and roughly 45 percent since the summer. And the American benchmark continued its free fall as well, to below $58 a barrel, down around 4 percent. A day earlier, it sagged below $60 a barrel in the United States for the first time since 2009.

The new rout began Friday morning after the International Energy Agency, the organization based in Paris that advises industrial countries, cut its forecast for global demand for crude oil in 2015 by 230,000 barrels a day. The agency cited less oil consumption in countries that produce it like Russia and a weaker-than-expected global economy.

A trim of 230,000 barrels a day is minimal in a global market of about 93 million barrels a day. But the lower forecast, the fourth by the agency in the last five months, reinforced the sentiment that supply will most likely exceed demand substantially next year.

The Energy Department also issued a report later in the day predicting that American oil production would average 9.3 million barrels a day in 2015, 700,000 barrels more than this year. That is a small downward revision of production previously predicted by the department, but its report emphasized that “all the decrease in forecast production growth comes in the second half of 2015.”

The department said that drilling activity in North Dakota, a main driver of the surging domestic oil production of recent years, has “not slowed, despite the significant decline in domestic crude oil prices since July 2014,” according to the most recent data released by North Dakota regulators.

The result was a near capitulation in the market for oil.

“In the very short term prices can go lower; the market is weighted to very bearish sentiment,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.

But even with the recent plunge, oil prices still have not approached the lows of recent decades. For example, oil briefly broke below $10 a barrel in 1986, which equates to about $21 today after adjusting for inflation.

At least in the short term, the declines are good news for American drivers about to take vacations or visit their families and friends for the holidays.

“Gas prices will continue to be in a free fall as long as crude oil is searching for a bottom,” the AAA motor club reported on Friday.

Nationally, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline fell 2 cents on Friday to $2.60, 11 cents below its price a week ago, according to AAA. Drivers on average are paying $1.10 a gallon less than they paid on April 28, the high point for the year in gas prices.

“Many drivers are spending $15 to $30 less per trip to the gas station compared to what they paid during this year’s highs,” the motor club said.

New York is the only state in the continental United States with an average above $3 a gallon, the motor club said, but at $3.02, “the average should drop below that mark within a few days.”

Analysts say a major cut in global production would be needed next year to avoid an inventory buildup and to stabilize falling prices. But the prospect of a supply cut was dashed last month when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries declined to change its output ceilings at a meeting in Vienna.

A test of strength appears to be occurring among the Saudis and their equally prosperous Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and other producers like Venezuela and Iran, which can much less easily afford a long bout of low prices. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E. have about $1.5 trillion in financial assets among them, which is “plenty to meet their spending needs for the next few years,” said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London.

At the same time, Venezuela, Nigeria and other producers are “going to have to cut back on spending,” Ms. Ziemba said. Already, Venezuelan officials have said it may be necessary to call an emergency OPEC meeting if the price rout continues.

The Saudis and their allies argue that to cut production now to raise prices would be to subsidize competitors like the companies extracting oil from shale in the United States, which are responsible for recent big additions to world oil supplies.","Oil Prices Fall Again, and Stocks Follow Suit",2014-12-13,"The swoon in oil prices led to a steep decline in equities, as investors feared that the declining energy demand meant that the global economy was slowing.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-fall-again-and-stocks-follow-suit.html

LONDON — Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday amid concerns that fighting in the Arabian Peninsula between a Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels in Yemen could disrupt supplies.

While Yemen is a minor-league oil producer, the fact that Saudi Arabia, the country’s northern neighbor and one of the world’s leading oil exporters, had become embroiled in an armed conflict roiled the market, even though analysts said there was very little near-term chance of a disruption in petroleum production.

What might matter more, they said, is the longer-term market impact of rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

“This is a subset of a broader regional conflict, and as it intensifies, the odds of it affecting a major oil producer continue to rise,” said Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in London.

Those general jitters could explain why oil prices spiked in early European trading on Thursday after news that Saudi Arabia had bombed targets in Yemen.

The price of West Texas intermediate crude, the main American benchmark, rose about 4.5 percent in morning trading, while Brent crude, the widely used international reference, rose about 4 percent.

In early afternoon trading in New York, the West Texas benchmark was up 4.5 percent on the day, to $51.40, and Brent crude was up 4.9 percent, to $59.27.

Both benchmarks are up more than 10 percent from the multiyear lows they reached in mid-March — although they are still down about 40 percent from their prices a year ago.

“I think it’s a very minimal risk to oil supplies,” said Rachel Ziemba, a Middle East analyst at Roubini Global Economics, a financial research firm, said of the Saudi strikes. “It is important to remember that Yemen is not a major producer; in fact, that there is a Saudi-led operation in Yemen, which has been a failed state for some time, should not be a surprise.”

But Ms. Ziemba and other analysts said that the Saudi intervention came as a reminder that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — still the world’s most important oil producing region — remain high, and appear to be rising. The civil war in Syria is showing little sign of winding down, and parts of Iraq remain conflict zones.

A theme that runs through these conflicts is the jockeying for power between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most powerful countries in the region, as well as in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In Yemen, for instance, Iran backs the rebels, while Saudi Arabia has tried to prop up the beleaguered president.

Iran and other OPEC countries are unhappy with the recent Saudi policy of declining to cut production to prop up prices. In fact, the Saudis appear to be increasing their output, analysts say.

“The market has begun to react to geopolitical supply risks once again, a trend that has been largely absent in recent months, underscoring how fundamentals have shifted,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm.

Still, most analysts say there is a strong possibility that oil prices will head down again. The market remains oversupplied, although there is debate about the magnitude of the glut. Demand usually weakens in the second quarter of the year as winter winds down in the northern hemisphere and refineries shut down for maintenance.

In addition, oil supplies have built up to high levels in storage tanks in the United States, partly because, as a matter of government policy, American companies are not allowed to export surplus crude. A deal between the United States and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program would lead eventually to a rise in Iranian oil exports, adding to levels of crude.

Analysts say that in the coming weeks, the oil markets may be whipsawed as participants try to reconcile the continuing oversupply with Middle East turmoil.

“It is always a funny congruence when you have high political risk but also very weak market fundamentals,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, an information and consulting service in Massachusetts. “It is the kind of thing that makes traders happy because they see volatility ahead.”

The Saudi bombing, which continued on Thursday, began as Yemen slid toward civil war, and the Houthi rebels, who have received support from Iran, were close to seizing the southern port of Aden, where Yemen’s president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has been hiding.

Although the Saudis said they were suspending civil aviation in the southern part of the kingdom near Yemen, the fighting is a long way from the main Saudi oil production centers in the east and poses little threat to the huge oil industry there, analysts said.

The conflict could further reduce Yemen’s modest oil production, which, because of disruptions and lack of investment, dropped to 130,000 barrels a day last year, less than a third of what the country produced at a peak in 2001. But Yemen’s production is a tiny fraction of world output and is unlikely to be missed.

Of greater concern is Yemen’s location on the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a narrow choke point between Yemen and Africa through which tankers and other ships pass as they head around the Arabian Peninsula and up the Red Sea toward the Suez Canal. According to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the United States government, about 7 percent of world maritime oil trade went through that passage in 2013. If the route were closed, ships would need to go around Africa, a much longer journey.",Oil Prices Jump as Saudi and Yemen Fighting Escalates,2015-03-27,Concerns over a possible disruption in supplies forced prices up as Saudi Arabia began airstrikes against Yemen.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-jump-as-saudi-and-yemen-fighting-escalates.html

The sharp drop in oil prices will benefit American consumers, many of the nation’s businesses and the economy as a whole. So why are stock market investors behaving as though oil under $50 a barrel and gasoline prices hovering around $2 a gallon are bad news?

The overall market’s recent decline reflects more than just the free fall in oil prices. Overseas economies are struggling; last week, the World Bank cut its forecast for global growth to 3 percent from 3.4 percent.

But fears about losses emanating from a devastated oil patch have weighed heavily on broad stock indexes, investment strategists say. This response appears to be a case of investors seizing on the industry’s highly visible losers while ignoring the far larger number of winners.

“The stock market has reacted negatively, and some of that comes down to the fact that you can see what the impact is on large energy firms,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. “It’s harder initially to see the positive impact that spreads around the rest of the economy. The big benefit to consumers is not as noticeable.”

Since the beginning of 2015, the broad market averages have lost roughly 2 percent of their value. The collapse in oil company shares, of course, has been far greater.

The Standard & Poor’s index of 80 oil and gas exploration companies is down 11.14 percent in 2015 and 35.4 percent over the last 52 weeks. The S.&P. index of six large oil services companies has fallen 5.2 percent so far this year, and 12.4 percent over the last year.

Both indexes reflect the undeniable pain that oil and gas producers, their investors, suppliers, service providers, workers and lenders are going to feel.

Layoff announcements, disclosures of capital spending cuts and falling rig counts are all highly visible to investors. So are anecdotal tales of woe from former boomtowns in North Dakota.

Less conspicuous, however, are the winners in a world of cheaper oil, economists say. The good news is, they far outnumber the losers.

David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., estimates that the economic output among oil companies and related businesses could decline by as much as $150 billion this year because of the oil price collapse. But an increase of about $400 billion is expected in other areas of the economy, he said. The net effect is double the annual value of the two percentage point payroll tax cut in 2011 and 2012, which provided a big increase to consumer spending.

“The market’s first reaction to almost any shock is not to like it because it raises the uncertainty premium,” Mr. Kotok said. “Meanwhile, the beneficial effects happen over a longer period, when the change is perceived and anticipated to become more permanent. The difference between temporary and permanent may explain the behavior of the markets here.”

To some degree, investors are operating in an information vacuum: They don’t yet have clarity on the full effects of under-$50 oil.

News items about companies mothballing projects that are no longer economically viable have been common: Last week, for example, Royal Dutch Shell canceled a $6.5 billion petrochemical plant deal it struck with Qatar Petroleum in 2011.

Still, few of the major oil companies — which must plan over a long time horizon, building in expectations that prices will eventually rebound — have disclosed their spending plans for 2015.

One that has, ConocoPhillips, says it plans to invest $13.5 billion, a 20 percent drop from 2014. Much of that decline resulted from lower expenditures on unconventional energy projects, the company said.

Another wild card in assessing the impact of the oil decline is the shale oil industry. Because the economics of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are not the same as those of traditional wells, it is unclear how investment and production in this industry will be affected by the price decline.

Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics in London noted in an analysis last week that many shale projects had short-term variable operating costs as low as $20 a barrel. Production in such projects won’t necessarily be stopped just because oil prices have fallen to $45 a barrel, he concluded.

Of course, a sizable reduction in the industry’s capital spending and the number of workers it employs is certainly coming. Total employment in the oil industry — including oil and gas extraction and support services — averaged 528,000 in 2014, according to Rigzone, an industry data provider.

“My guess is that in 2014, energy companies spent over $200 billion, mostly on structures but also on equipment,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He now expects that figure to fall by half or more.

That’s not pocket change, but capital spending cuts will be small when set against the overall $17 trillion size of our economy. And even if the industry lost half its jobs — which it won’t — that would be equivalent to less than a single month’s gain for the overall economy, which added about 275,000 jobs a month last year.

“That completely dwarfs any hits in the oil business, capital spending and oil services business,” Mr. Shepherdson said.

Investors also seem to be ignoring the benefits of lower-cost oil to small businesses. In December, as the oil price was dropping, the National Federation of Independent Business’s optimism index returned to its prerecession average and rose to the highest point since October 2006.

Owners of these businesses say they are increasing their capital expenditures this year. The N.F.I.B.’s most recent quarterly survey showed capital spending among these businesses rising to a seven-year high. This, too, will help offset the drop in oil and gas expenditures.

The overall economic benefits of the collapse in oil prices are significant, Mr. Shepherdson said. He predicted that it could add almost one percentage point to real gross domestic product growth in the United States this year. In an economy trending at 2.25 percent annual growth, that’s a sizable gain.

“The oil business and everything to do with it is a very small share of the economy,” Mr. Shepherdson said. “Could it possibly be more than 5 percent of G.D.P? No, and the other 95 percent of the economy is saying, ‘Thank you very much.’ ”",What’s So Bad About Cheap Oil?,2015-01-18,"The stock market is treating lower prices as bad news even though they will help consumers, many of the nation’s businesses and the economy.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/business/whats-so-bad-about-cheap-oil.html
31,"For decades, Saudi Arabia was the primary force that made OPEC the swing producer in global markets.

After Saudi Arabia’s production peaked in 1980, it cut supplies later in the decade and again in the 1990s to prop up prices. The Saudis followed the same playbook when oil prices briefly sank during the 2008 global financial crisis and the economic slump the next year. When political turmoil rocked Libya, another producer, during the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia increased production to keep markets and its own revenue stable.

Now, Saudi Arabia’s role — and the broader market — is evolving.

United States oil production has nearly doubled over the last six years, crowding out Saudi Arabia and other OPEC imports. The situation has forced foreign producers into stiffer competition in Asia with supplies that once flooded the American market.

Saudi Arabia also needs to focus on its own larger and more diverse domestic needs. As the population has surged and the middle class has expanded, consumption has skyrocketed in recent years. Energy subsidies intended to prevent political instability have only added to the demand.

With consumption increasing, Saudi Arabia has been moving up the value chain, looking beyond exporting crude oil to higher-margin businesses like refining and petrochemicals. The country has a new $22 billion joint venture with Dow Chemical and several new refineries costing $12 billion each.

Saudi experts say oil policy is increasingly being set by younger technocrats surrounding the new king, Salman, who came to the throne in January. While the new leadership is still focused with the price of crude, it is equally attuned to how any cuts in production might slow the overall Saudi economy and hurt jobs at a time when political turbulence is spreading across the region.

The group of senior government officials and oil executives saw the drop in oil prices coming last year. And they successfully argued that short-term reactions to bolster prices in the middle of terrorist attacks and revolutions around the region only supported less-efficient production in places like the United States and Canada.

“Is Saudi Arabia still willing to play the swing producer and juggle the whole domestic economy, refineries, power plants, desalination, petrochemicals, just to meet the expectations of either OPEC or non-OPEC producers? The answer is no, obviously not,” said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, a former executive vice president for Saudi Aramco, the state oil company.

“It is very inefficient to put up a lot of capacity and then shut it down and then start it up — to try to second-guess market trends and all sorts of political considerations that are very damaging to the economy,” Mr. al-Husseini added.

Energy consumption in Saudi Arabia is growing faster than in almost any other country in the world, at an average of 6 percent a year over the last decade. Oil is the base fuel for Saudi electricity and desalination of water for the desert kingdom, and any shift to nuclear power and renewable sources like solar has been slow.

That makes any production cut a more delicate issue.

In the 1980s, during a prolonged oil price drop, Saudi Arabia cut about four million barrels a day of production in an unsuccessful attempt to stabilize the market. A similarly sized cut would no longer be possible, energy experts say.

Saudi Arabia is pumping 10.3 million barrels a day. The kingdom needs to produce nearly eight million barrels to collect the natural gas that comes out of the ground with the oil; such gas is critical for powering its residential and industrial needs.

“The demand for gas keeps increasing,” said Jean-Francois Seznec, a professor of Persian Gulf political economy at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. “They have a limit to how much oil they can cut. That creates more limits on their ability to manage the market.”

As the Saudis’ taste for luxury has expanded, so, too, has domestic demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. It has grown 60 percent since 2005, converting the kingdom to a net importer of transportation fuel from an exporter.

That has stretched the output of the nation’s refineries, with production of processed fuels rising nearly 30 percent in the last decade to 2.3 million barrels a day. With new refineries being built, output is expected to rise to three million barrels a day by the end of the decade.

Saudi Arabia remains a crucial power in global oil markets. But the quality of much of its crude oil production has declined over time, with more of its production including heavier, more sour crudes which are sold more cheaply on global markets than the sweeter varieties.

To compensate, Saudi Arabia has spread its refinery business across the globe, building and expanding in the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. Many of those ventures are meant to process lower Saudi grades of crude to defend against similar products, particularly in Latin America. Those refineries depend on more than two million barrels of Saudi exports a day, further reducing the country’s ability to cut crude output.

“You invest all this money in refining, and you need to supply it with a steady supply of crude no matter what,” said Jim Krane, a Middle East oil expert at the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. “You can’t really have all your production spoken for and still be a flexible swing supplier that acts to calm market volatility.”

While Saudi Arabia’s sway is changing, the domestic and overseas investment also gives the country a significant advantage in an increasingly competitive business. A huge refinery network provides the Saudis with a home for their oil at a time when they are battling OPEC rivals like Iran and Iraq over markets, especially in Asia.

“When competition is so keen to sell crude oil, the Saudis sell it in dedicated systems that they control. They don’t have to fight for every barrel,” said Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of FGE, a market research firm. “No one else can do this.”","Prices Are Down, but Saudis Keep Oil Flowing",2015-06-01,The change is upending the traditional market dynamics that have influenced the direction of oil prices for decades.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/business/energy-environment/prices-are-down-but-saudis-keep-oil-flowing.html

The recent global drop in oil prices has made winners of consumers in places like the United States and Japan, and losers of countries that depend heavily on oil exports such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela. China, a leading crude oil importer and the world’s largest energy consumer, has responded to the fall in oil prices — the steepest since 2009 — by going on a buying spree to ensure that its strategic oil reserves at the end of 2014 were twice what they were the year before. Last month, in another move to bolster the country’s supplies, China’s top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, directed domestic oil refiners to stock up on crude oil and to provide the government with monthly updates on their inventories.

Matt Ferchen is an associate professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a resident scholar at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy. His latest research focuses on China’s energy sector and its political and economic ties to emerging economies. In an interview, he discussed how the decline in oil prices would affect China’s relations with other countries and its transition to a more energy-efficient future.

Q.

Crude oil prices have fallen to a five-year low, and one response by China has been to build up its strategic petroleum reserves. How well is China handling this opportunity?

A.

China has relatively small reserves compared to the United States, and they can probably only last weeks compared to months in the U.S., so there’s a real need for China to add to those reserves. While other commodity prices have gone down as well, bringing down the overall price of Chinese imports doesn’t solve the long-term energy security problems that China faces. This is going to ultimately be to the detriment of the Chinese economy and to thinking about energy security.

Q.

Have lower oil prices benefited Chinese consumers?



A.

It should help to keep inflation down. However, I heard that the gas price is stable at the pump in China, which means the oil companies themselves have in some way increased profitability. I think the question of who is actually seeing the benefit of decreased oil prices is not clear in China, whereas it is obvious in the United States — it’s going to the consumers. But there’s also a downside to that in the U.S., because now people are going to buy gas at the time we’ve seen a greater push for energy efficiency and more fuel-efficient cars, so it seems this development will cut into that momentum in the U.S. right now.

So even if consumers do see lower prices at the pump in China, it’s not at all clear this is a good thing for China. The lower oil price comes with complicating effects as you try to make progress on energy efficiency.

Q.

Are lower prices likely to cause China to trim back its exploration efforts for energy resources in the South China Sea and thereby reduce tensions with Southeast Asian neighbors that dispute China’s claims to these waters?



A.

I don’t think it’s going to ease the tensions. I think China will continue to explore for resources. A lot of it is still exploration just to see what’s out there. In some sense, there should be a disincentive for Chinese exploration when prices are this low, but I think state-owned enterprises have a different time horizon and face different economic incentives, especially when compared to private firms, and therefore will continue on with plans as they exist.

They don’t pay the costs, ultimately, in the same way that private firms do. For instance, if a lot of your exploration is built on credit, as it is in the U.S. with shale development, there’s a limited time horizon and eventually you’ve got to pay someone else back. Chinese state-owned enterprises don’t face that same problem.

Q.

With Russia in economic trouble, between Western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine and falling revenues from oil exports, will it move closer to China?

A.

I think China’s calculations in terms of energy deals hinge on a more advantageous bargaining position over the price of oil, so that leads to greater interest by China to engage with Russia. And, to the extent that Russia now has limited alternatives, that will lead Russia to be willing to make more agreements. I think Russia has a continuing incentive to show that it does have alternatives in terms of markets and also that it has strategic, like-minded partners in a world that is portrayed as hostile to the interests of the nontraditional powers such as BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa]. Russia, now under fire from sanctions and a drop in commodity prices, therefore needs a partner. I think that pushes the two sides together both in terms of substantive cooperation and also in an effort to enhance the image of renewed comradeship.

Q.

What about China’s relationship with oil-rich Iran, which is under international sanctions because of its nuclear programs?

A.

I think the more interesting question is how China views what is and what isn’t stable in the Middle East in terms of political processes. Iran represents a country where the U.S. sees not only a problematic nuclear policy, but also a support for governments in the region including Syria and is therefore a major source of concern and instability in the region, whereas that is not the perception from China. China worries about the tensions between the U.S. and Iran and would prefer to see a negotiated outcome there.

When Chinese officials and academics speak about Chinese interests in the Middle East, they frequently mention the political stability of the region, the stability of energy production and flows and, to an increasing extent, the ways the region’s instabilities may tie in to domestic concerns within parts of China about separatism and terrorism. So if the U.S. and Iran can normalize their relations, therefore increasing flows of Iranian oil and inducing a more constructive role for Iran in reducing regional tensions, it’s possible that both the U.S. and China could see Iran as a force for the Middle Eastern stability that both claim to want.

Q.

How do lower oil prices change China’s incentives to make progress on renewable energy? Will they help China reach its goals on deterring climate change, which include seeing the country’s carbon dioxide emissions peak by around 2030?

A.

I think the drop in oil prices can only be bad for renewable energy. If we see prices at the pump reflecting the change, then I think it would be negative for renewable energy as it would contribute to vehicle use and more people buying cars and contributing to poor air quality. On the other hand, if the government has benefited from lower oil prices and puts the surplus into other kinds of energy-efficient policies, that could be a good thing. They could use this opportunity to put in place healthier kinds of plans.

Q.

In a talk before the Foreign Correspondents Club in Beijing, you said that 2014 saw energy return to the top of the world agenda in a way not seen since the 1970s. Can you elaborate on the implications for China?



A.

In the U.S. in the 1970s there was a remarkable convergence of public policy, academic and NGO scrutiny of the impact of multinational companies on U.S. foreign policy. Much, although not all, of this attention was focused on the role of U.S. energy and other extractive industry firms. Because of the two OPEC oil shocks of the 1970s there was heightened concern about U.S. energy security in general, and many began to ask whether the private interests of American multinational companies was synonymous with the overall U.S. national interest. In response, policy makers passed legislation like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, academics created the field of international political economy, and environmental and labor NGOs shined a new light on multinational companies’ behavior abroad.

In the last decade, China has experienced a boom in its own outbound foreign direct investment, especially in energy and other extractive industries. In a variety of countries, such as Sudan, Myanmar and Venezuela, the behavior of Chinese state-owned firms and banks has arguably created unanticipated and unwanted foreign policy headaches. The time, therefore, seems ripe for China to experience its own renaissance in how its government and citizens understand and govern how Chinese firms’ foreign behavior impacts the national interest.",Q. and A.: Matt Ferchen on China and the Price of Oil ,2015-02-04,"Matt Ferchen, an associate professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing, discusses how oil prices will affect China’s relations with other countries and its transition to a more energy-efficient future.",http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/q-and-a-matt-ferchen-on-china-and-the-price-of-oil/

47,"There has been nothing like that kind of excess over the past five years, despite the frenzy of drilling across the Permian Basin, the granddaddy of American oil fields. Set in a forsaken desert where tumbleweed drifts through long-forgotten towns, the region has undergone a renaissance in the last four years, with horizontal drilling and fracking reaching through multiple layers of shales stacked one over the other like a birthday cake.

But since the Permian Basin rig count peaked at around 570 last September, it has fallen below 490, and local oil executives say the count will probably go down to as low as 300 by April unless prices rebound.

The last time the rig count declined as rapidly was in late 2008 and early 2009, when the price of oil fell from over $140 to under $40 a barrel because of the financial crisis. The United States benchmark was down $1.17 on Monday to $47.52.

Unlike traditional oil wells, which cannot be turned on and off so easily, shale production can be cut back quickly, and so the field’s output should slow considerably by the end of the year.

The Dallas Federal Reserve recently estimated that the falling oil prices and other factors would reduce job growth in Texas overall from 3.6 percent in 2014 to as low as 2 percent this year, or a reduction of about 149,000 in jobs created.

Midland’s recent good fortune is plain to see. The city has grown in population from 108,000 in 2010 to 140,000 today, and there has been an explosion of hotel and apartment construction. Companies like Chevron and Occidental are building new local headquarters. Real estate values have roughly doubled over the past five years, according to Mayor Jerry Morales.

The city has built a new fire station and recruited new police officers with the infusion of tax receipts, which increased 19 percent from 2013 to 2014 alone. A $14 million court building is scheduled to break ground next month. But the city has also put away $39 million in a rainy-day fund for the inevitable oil bust.

“This is just a cooling-off period,” Mayor Morales said. “We will prevail again.”

Expensive restaurants are still full, and traffic around the city can be brutal. Still, everyone seems to sense that the pain is coming, and they are preparing for it.

“We are responding to survive, so that we may once again thrive when we come out the other side,” said Steven H. Pruett, president and chief executive of Elevation Resources, a Midland-based oil exploration and production company. “Six months ago there was a swagger in Midland, and now that swagger is gone.”

Mr. Pruett’s company had six rigs running in early December but now has only three. It will go down to one by the end of the month, even though he must continue to pay a service company for two of the rigs because of a long-term contract.

The other day Mr. Pruett drove to a rig outside Odessa he feels compelled to park to save cash, and he expressed concern that as many as 50 service workers could eventually lose their jobs.

But the workers themselves seemed stoic about their fortunes, if not upbeat.

“It’s always in the back of your mind — being laid off and not having the security of a regular job,” said Randy Perry, a tool-pusher, or rig crew manager, who makes $115,000 a year, plus bonuses. But Mr. Perry said he always has a backup plan because layoffs are so common, even inevitable.

Since graduating from high school a decade ago, he has bought several houses in East Texas and fixed them up, doing the plumbing and electrical work himself. At age 29, with a wife and three children, he has three houses, and if he is let go, he says, he could sell one for a profit he estimates at $50,000 to $100,000.

Just a few weeks ago, he and other employees received a note from Trent Latshaw, the head of his company, Latshaw Drilling, saying that layoffs may be necessary this year.

“The people of the older generation tell the young guys to save and invest the money you make and have cash flow just in case,” Mr. Perry said during a work break. “I feel like everything is going to be O.K. This is not going to last forever.”

The most nervous people in Midland seem to be the oil executives who say busts may be inevitable, but how long they last is anybody’s guess.

Over a lavish buffet lunch recently at the Petroleum Club of Midland, the talk was woeful and full of conspiracy theories about how the Saudis were refusing to cut supplies to vanquish the surging American oil industry.

“At $45 a barrel, it shuts down nearly every project,” Steve J. McCoy, Latshaw Drilling’s director of business development, told Mr. Pruett and his guests. “The Saudis understand, and they are killing us.”

Mr. Pruett nodded in agreement, adding, “They are trash-talking the price of oil down.”

He continued: “Everyone has been saying ‘Happy New Year.’ Yeah, some happy new year.”",On to Plan B as Oil Work Stalls in Texas,2015-01-20,"Many residents of Midland, a community dependent on oil drilling, already have their backup plans in place as work starts to dry up.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/business/energy-environment/in-texas-hunkering-down-for-the-oil-bust.html

HOUSTON — Oil and gasoline prices have been on a ferocious rebound over the last month, and there were signs on Wednesday that declining domestic inventories could mean still higher prices as the summer driving season approaches.

The Energy Department reported on Wednesday that United States crude oil stockpiles fell last week for the first time since December, down by nearly four million barrels.

Several factors point to a continuing rise in American crude prices, which collapsed by roughly half between July and early January. These include rising refinery processing rates, declining imports and a flattening of domestic crude production as companies decommission more drilling rigs.

Oil prices were volatile for the day, and the American West Texas Intermediate benchmark rose 32 cents a barrel to finish the trading day at $60.72 a barrel. The price, which rose above $60 for the first time this year earlier in the week, has risen by roughly 40 percent since late March.

The international Brent benchmark has nearly revived to $70 a barrel, although that is still more than 30 percent below its high of last summer.

Gasoline prices are rising along with those of oil. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline on Wednesday was $2.63, according to the AAA auto club, a full penny more than the day before. The average price is up nearly 25 cents a gallon over the last month, but still remains $1.04 lower per gallon than a year ago.

The steady rise in fuel prices buoyed the spirits of energy company executives, who cut investments in exploration and production by as much as 30 percent this year. Talk began to surface around the oil shale fields of Texas and North Dakota of bringing rigs idled over the last six months back on as profit margins improved.

“We think we are going through a natural cycle,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, president and chief executive of GE Oil and Gas. “There should be an upward trend. With lower investments, over the next six months, supplies are going to be impacted. Demand continues to increase, and you’ll see a price that starts to drift upward.”

The government said the country was still producing nearly 9.4 million barrels a day, just a bit off multidecade highs. Commercial crude and refined product inventories remained well above normal.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Some energy experts warned that the Energy Department might be underestimating American oil production and that the price of oil could dip again. They said that companies had drilled hundreds of wells but were waiting for higher prices before completing them for production.

In a note to investors on Wednesday, Citi Research warned that “higher prices could presage a production surge later this year as uncompleted wells are worked down and rig counts rise. Inventories could stay stubbornly high over the year, and refinery maintenance in the fall could drive large stock builds on an already high base.”

A major reason for the slide in inventories was a weekly drop of nearly a million barrels a day in imports at a time when the trade balance had otherwise been deteriorating.

Another reason oil prices have risen is a return of risk to supplies abroad. With chaos spreading across Libya, protesters in recent days have closed one of the few major export ports that had still been open. Energy experts say up to a half million barrels of daily world supplies of crude are at risk in Libya.

52,"LONDON — As oil prices continued to fall, the British oil giant BP said on Wednesday that it would cut jobs and take $1 billion in restructuring charges over the next five quarters.

The company said that it did not yet know how many people would be let go, but that most of the money would go to severance packages. With the amount of money earmarked, that could mean thousands of job cuts. BP had 84,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year.

The price of the international benchmark, Brent crude, was down more than 1.5 percent on Wednesday to about $65.32. It is now down more than 40 percent since June.

The cartel of oil-producing nations, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, on Wednesday added to the downdraft in prices with its monthly oil market report for December. The organization forecast that demand for its members’ crude would be only 28.9 million barrels a day next year, well below the ceiling of 30 million barrels a day that it recently decided to hold steady.

Analysts agree that a hefty production trim of at least one million barrels a day is needed to head off an expected surge in inventories in the first half of next year. But so far, Saudi Arabia, which would be the main candidate in OPEC to trim output, shows little sign of being willing to do so.

That leaves big oil companies with the task of doing their own trimming.

Besides BP, other oil giants have announced cutbacks in light of the price decline, including ConocoPhillips, which on Monday said it would cut investment spending next year by 20 percent. Analysts expect other companies to join the trend.

BP is reducing its work force not only to adjust to what its executives say may be a prolonged period of low oil prices but also to reflect the much smaller size of the company after selling $43 billion in assets after the Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010. BP says it has sold about 50 percent of its installations, like production platforms, and so needs substantially fewer people to operate them.

The company was already examining ways of reducing jobs. But the roughly 40 percent drop in oil prices since June “has increased our focus on these activities,” David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, said. Mr. Nicholas said the job reductions were underway and would continue through next year, in all parts of its business.

In a sense, the Gulf of Mexico disaster put BP ahead of the industry’s cost-cutting curve. The company was forced to sell oil and gas fields in the United States, the North Sea and elsewhere, reducing its production to a little over two million barrels a day — not counting the output it derives from its nearly 20 percent holding in Russia’s state-controlled oil company, Rosneft — from about three million barrels a day before the blowout.

As a result, BP has been able to a greater degree than some of its rivals to hold down spending, although perhaps not as much as it may need to in the future.

Lamar McKay, the company’s head of exploration and production, said in a presentation to analysts on Wednesday that, historically, up to two years were required for prices to recover from steep declines.

“OPEC’s recent decision not to cut production has also left the market more vulnerable” to the forces of supply and demand, Mr. McKay said.

Mr. McKay said that BP was likely to cut back on its capital expenditures. In March, the company said the spending would be $24 billion to $26 billion a year through 2018. But that estimate might be cut by up to $2 billion or more in 2015. And Mr. McKay said that “given the recent position taken by OPEC and with oil prices where they are today” the company would “review this further.”

Analysts say that other companies are likely to follow BP’s cost-cutting example. Oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell and Total had already been reining in spending on their projects and selling off properties in response to investor complaints about soaring costs and diminishing returns.

During several years of stable and relatively high prices, costs for everything from labor to drilling rigs to specialized steel had surged. BP, for instance, said on Wednesday that its costs for producing a barrel had risen more than fourfold in the last decade, to about $13 per barrel. Taxes on production have also risen sharply.

The squeeze is only just beginning, analysts say. “There will be even more pressure on the financials of the main operators,” Martijn Rats, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said in an interview.

Mr. Rats said in a recent note to clients that he expected the major oil companies to try to save billions of dollars through delaying projects, reducing drilling and other spending on exploration, and twisting the arms of the oil service companies, like Schlumberger and Halliburton, which do much of the work in oil fields today, to lower their prices.

In a presentation to investors this month, Patrick Schorn, president for operations at Schlumberger, the largest provider of services like fracking and seismic surveying, said that lower oil prices had elicited “a very strong focus from our customers on short-term cost-cutting.”

Mr. Schorn said that the squeeze was hitting exploration hard and that the company was reducing by about a third the fleet of boats it used for making surveys of undersea oil deposits, leading to an estimated $800 million write-off. Mr. Schorn also said that Schlumberger would be reducing its work force, a move that would lead to about $200 million in further charges this quarter.",BP to Cut Jobs as Price of Oil Falls,2014-12-11,"Faced by difficult market conditions, the British oil giant is to spend $1 billion on restructuring, a move that could eliminate thousands of jobs.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/business/bp-to-cut-jobs-as-price-of-oil-falls.html

57,"The slump in oil prices weighed on stocks again on Tuesday, giving energy companies another day of big losses. Disappointing earnings outlooks from several companies, including Priceline and Michael Kors, also affected the market.

Oil has fallen sharply in recent weeks as global supplies rise while demand for fuel trails expectations. The latest decline was prompted by reports that Saudi Arabia was cutting the price of oil that it supplies to the United States as it tries to maintain its market share in the face of booming American production.

The drop in oil prices has hit energy stocks hard, driving them into negative territory for the year. It has also helped push the stock market back from the record levels that it had reached last week.

“It’s a case of sell first, ask questions later for anything oil-related,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.

72,"When is good economic news a reason to worry?

When you’re a central banker fighting a slump toward deflation, or broadly falling prices, in a time that oil prices are plummeting. And that is the situation that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, faced as he announced the results of the bank’s latest policy meeting on Thursday. How he wrestles with that problem will help determine the outlook for Europe’s flailing economy.

The official line from many of the world’s most influential makers of economic policy is that this is fantastic news for global growth, at least in places that don’t count oil production as their dominant local industry.

“If I was to address an audience in Saudi Arabia, Qatar or Kuwait, I wouldn’t discuss it exactly the same way,” said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, at an event in Washington this week. “But on a net-net basis, it is good news for the global economy.”

The fund estimates that a 30 percent decline in oil prices should improve growth by 0.8 of a percentage point in most advanced economies, Ms. Lagarde said. And prices are down more than that — about 35 percent since June 30.

There is little doubt that falling prices for oil and other commodities are good news for global consumers, as we noted last week. Less money spent on gasoline and other fuels means more to spend on everything else, in effect raising people’s real incomes.

But the challenge Mr. Draghi and his fellow central bankers face is that they are trying — almost desperately — to attain higher inflation, closer to the 2 percent they target. And falling oil prices will drive inflation down further, particularly as the lower price of oil ripples through global supply chains and starts to affect more retail prices.

In Central Banking 101, they teach you this about fluctuations in energy prices: It would be unwise to react to short-term moves that will have only a transitory effect on inflation. Oil prices go up and down — there’s nothing you can do about it — but when they do, it doesn’t tell you much about the longer-term path of inflation. Central bankers should keep looking over the horizon and focusing on the medium term.

Following that guidance, central bankers would do pretty much whatever they were planning to do a few months ago, before the oil sell-off began. For the Fed, that would mean raising interest rates in mid-2015.

But the Central Banking 101 lesson changes when a move in the price of oil and other commodities has some lasting effects on people’s psychology. In the 1970s, for example, the oil price spikes caused by the Arab embargo combined with steadily increasing prices and wages to make people expect ever-increasing inflation, which became self-fulfilling as the decade progressed.

In the 1970s, in other words, even if the Fed and other central banks shouldn’t have reacted to the initial spike in oil prices, they should (in hindsight) have done more to fight the rising expectation of high inflation that it helped foster.

We are in the exact opposite situation right now. Inflation is persistently low across the advanced world amid sluggish growth. And expectations are setting in more and more that this low-inflation world is here to stay, at least as measured by the bond market.

At the same time oil prices have fallen, investors’ expectations for future inflation have also been falling in most of the world’s leading economies; in Germany, bond market prices suggest annual inflation will be only 0.26 percent over the next five years, down from 0.8 percent at the end of June.

Markets are even pricing in lower American inflation in the five years after that — 2019 through 2024 — than they were this past summer.

So what’s a central banker to do? A different tone is emanating from the three most important global central banks.

In the United States, the Fed vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, said this week that he viewed falling oil prices as “a phenomenon that’s making everybody better off” and that “the lower inflation that we’ll get from a lower price of oil is going to be temporary.”

His counterparts in Japan and Europe don’t seem so sure. The Bank of Japan recently did a surprise expansion of its program to pump yen into the Japanese economy, in part because lower energy prices are causing falling inflation at a time the bank is trying to persuade consumers and businesses that inflation will rise.

In his news conference Thursday, Mr. Draghi betrayed deep-seated worries that the falling oil prices would affect this inflationary psychology. While he concluded, like Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Fischer, that the impact of energy price declines was “unambiguously positive,” he continued by mentioning that the bank was monitoring an “effect that might happen if the lower prices get embedded in a lower wage formation process.”

In other words, workers might demand smaller raises and employers might be less likely to grant raises amid the falling oil prices, which would create a self-fulfilling cycle leading to still lower inflation. Mr. Draghi said that the bank’s governing council would evaluate this possibility as it weighs new actions to try to increase growth and inflation in Europe early next year.

Indeed, Bill Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a speech this week that this might be another way lower oil prices make the United States better off: It may be the thing that pushes policy makers in Europe and Japan to act more forcefully to combat their nations’ economic weakness, which may just make everybody better off.",Falling Oil Prices Create a Central Banking Conundrum,2014-12-05,"One result is to drive down inflation worldwide, at a time when inflation is already lower than central bankers consider ideal.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/upshot/falling-oil-prices-create-a-central-banking-conundrum.html

The market for crude oil is in veritable free fall. The price of a barrel has dropped 30 percent since June, and the ripples have only begun, with analysts warning of everything from bankruptcies of Texas oil fields to economic troubles in big oil-producing nations like Venezuela and Nigeria.

If oil prices stay low or keep falling, it will be one of the most important trends shaping the world economy in 2015, which raises the question: Why is this happening? To answer that, it is useful to look at the market for another fluid that is stored in barrels, one that is less economically consequential but quite a bit more tasty: bourbon.

As it turns out, oil producers from Dallas to Abu Dhabi could learn a few things from the Kentucky distilleries that turn out nectarlike whiskeys.

What oil and bourbon have in common are the long time lags between investment in a new supply and availability of the finished product. With bourbon, that’s because a distiller must keep the good stuff in barrels for seven, 10, or even 20 years before it’s ready to drink. With oil, it’s because investment in new drilling projects is a slow-moving affair, frequently involving years of complex engineering and construction before the crude starts to flow.

The result for both is that supply is basically fixed in the short run. The amount of oil available in the near future is determined by investment decisions that oil producers made years ago. This creates big swings in prices over long time horizons that have broad effects on everything from the cars we drive to the politicians who win office.

The current sell-off in oil, for example, has its roots in actions taken in the middle of the last decade. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, oil was cheap — under $20 a barrel at the end of 2001. Those low prices left oil producers with little incentive to invest in drilling. Global investment in new production was only about $200 billion in 2004, according to estimates by an energy research firm, I.H.S. Herold.

But early this century, economic growth in emerging nations was stronger than oil producers had predicted, and the demand for energy soared. Years of underinvestment because of low prices started to become a problem. By 2008, the price of oil topped $140 a barrel, and investment approached $500 billion.

Now, the world finds itself living under the opposite circumstances. The increase in exploration that began in the last decade is starting to pay off in a big way, including a boom in the United States. After reaching five million barrels of oil a day in 2008, domestic crude output was up to 7.5 million in 2013 and is still rising.

Meanwhile, the gaudy growth rates in China and other emerging markets of the middle of the last decade have given way to slower expansion, and the giant economies of Europe, Japan and the United States have underperformed after years of crisis.

“We’re not going to see a synchronized global economic boom anytime soon,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of I.H.S. and author of “The Quest,” a book about the global oil market. “These cycles of investment and lumpiness of new supplies coming on, and of market reactions and economic cycles, are all at work. What’s the adjustment mechanism? It’s price.”

But the volatility of the last decade in the price of oil comes at a cost. Entirely different economic arrangements make sense when oil is $70 a barrel and when it is $140. People want to buy different cars; airlines fly different routes at different prices; investment in alternative energy sources becomes more or less viable; oil-producing countries can be flush or starving.

In other words, these cycles in oil prices are drastic, and can have real consequences in making it harder for businesses and societies to make long-term decisions. It can work against the interests of the oil producers themselves; the higher prices get, the more consumers and businesses have incentive to invest in efficiency and alternative energy sources.

Which brings us back to the bourbon market.

What is happening now in the market for high-quality bourbon is basically the opposite of what is happening with oil (or is parallel to what was happening with oil in 2007 and 2008). Over the last decade, bourbon has become the buzzy distilled spirit, as people who once favored vodka have discovered the appeal of bourbon brands like Pappy Van Winkle, Basil Hayden’s and Elijah Craig.

But just as oil producers can’t turn the spigot on new oil supplies overnight, the years that bourbon must spend in barrels have left producers behind the curve in keeping up with demand.

“In 2002 we would have been making Buffalo Trace to be sold in 2011,” said Mark Brown, the chief executive of Buffalo Trace Distillery. “There was absolutely no indication that demand would have reached the levels it reached.”

In the oil market, a global commodity with countless buyers and sellers, price is the only adjustment mechanism. But bourbon makers are, in many cases, trying to avoid raising their prices much.

“We’ve been adamant about not raising our prices to our distributors much beyond the cost of goods and inflation,” Mr. Brown said. “The reason for that is very simple. We’re in this business for the long term. Just because bourbon is hot right now doesn’t change our way of thinking to say let’s take advantage of the situation.”

Buffalo Trace and other bourbon makers try to carefully allocate their product to distributors around the country at what is, effectively, slightly below the market-clearing price. A result is headlines like “The Great Whiskey Shortage of 2013.” On the gray market, bottles of 23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle reach four-figure prices.

But the bet the bourbon industry is making is that there is more money to be made in the long run by cultivating a new generation of bourbon drinkers among young adults, and by building loyalty among customers in all corners of the United States, and eventually the world.

74,"But there is little doubt that low gas prices lead to extra spending across the economy. In fact, there are signs that some of that spending has already started.

“The magnitude of the gasoline price drop is profound,” said James D. Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego. “It is a significant boost to the spending power of most Americans. And the data shows that when Americans get this spending power, they go out and spend it.”

An intriguing AAA poll suggests that prices are already low enough to make a psychological difference. The poll, taken in March, found that $3.30 was the point at which half the driving population found that prices were fair.

At current levels, the average price of gasoline across the nation is 85 cents below that $3.30 fair-value level, and it has stayed under that threshold since the first week of October. What’s more, the AAA expects prices to drop as much as an additional 20 cents a gallon by New Year’s Day.

When gas prices break below a three-year trading range and then fall significantly lower, as they already have, people start to feel better about spending, Professor Hamilton said.

“When prices drop, that should stimulate demand, and I think that’s happening,” he said. The latest reports on retail sales, vehicle sales and consumer confidence have all been strong, he said, and “the fall in gas prices is a big part of it.”

In 2015, the government predicts, these trends are likely to continue: Gas prices are expected to remain very low, helping to reduce gasoline costs for the average household by $550 for the year, bringing them down to $1,962.

That should have an effect on the entire domestic economy. Despite the surge in American production that has contributed to the glut in supply and the fall in prices, the United States remains a net oil-consuming nation. That’s why the overall effect of falling oil prices should be positive for the United States — and harmful for net-producing nations like Russia — although it is hard to calculate the actual numbers.

Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics in London, made a stab at it with some back-of-the-envelope estimates. Based on full-year 2013 data from Capital Economics, a price decline of the dimensions we’ve already seen would cut six percentage points from the gross domestic product of Russia, a very severe blow.

For the United States, which is both a big producer and consumer of oil, some of the positives and negatives would balance out, resulting in a net addition of roughly one percentage point to annual G.D.P. The true number is debatable, but it’s clear that there will be a boost. And in a period like this, in which the economy has already picked up steam, it opens up some policy options.

Several factors have contributed to the price declines. An increase in oil production, especially in the United States, is part of the story, but so is a reduction in global demand.

“Outside the United States, much of the world’s economy has slowed down, and that’s had a big impact on global demand for oil,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust.

In addition, conservation efforts worldwide, including fuel-efficiency standards in the United States, have contributed to slackening demand and falling prices. We simply don’t burn as much energy as we did a few years ago to achieve the same amount of mileage, heat or manufacturing production.

But when prices drop, we run into a basic economic problem that could reverse some of these improvements in energy efficiency and conservation. With lower prices, demand rises and people consume more. Bargain gas prices induce people to hit the road. The AAA projects that during the year-end holiday period, people will drive 4 percent more than they did during the period last year. They also may be tempted to buy bigger, gas-guzzling vehicles. That’s happened before.

Certainly, if these trends continue as expected, fuel consumption will increase while the more expensive forms of oil production, now rendered less economical, will decline. With less supply and more demand, energy prices can be expected to rise again. We could be back, more or less, where we started.

That would be good for energy producers but not necessarily for anyone else. It’s why Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has called on policy makers around the world to impose taxes on carbon emissions and cut incentives for fossil-fuel energy production. “In fact, this is a golden opportunity,” Ms. van der Hoeven said earlier this month. “Policy makers can take actions unthinkable a year ago.”

Professor Hamilton pointed out that a carbon tax of $25 a ton — which the Obama administration has advocated, but Congress has opposed — converts to less than the amount that oil and gas prices have already fallen. A carbon tax wouldn’t be painful right now, but it would provide an incentive for energy efficiency.

There’s another economically interesting option. The nation’s bridges, highways and mass transit systems are in dire need of a big infusion of capital — and a major source of such money, the national Highway Trust Fund, which relies on gasoline taxes for revenue, is nearly depleted.

The national gas tax, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn’t increased since 1993. With falling gas prices, a tax increase would barely be noticeable at the pump. Such measures would make a great deal of economic sense, if politics didn’t get in the way.","Cheaper Oil, Fatter Wallets and a National Opportunity ",2014-12-21,"The drop in the cost of gas gives Americans more spending power, and might also make investments in infrastructure and the environment politically palatable.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/business/cheaper-oil-fatter-wallets-and-a-national-opportunity-.html
75,"Adding to Pemex’s woes, the government has sliced the company’s 2015 budget by about $4 billion. The move stymies the company’s push to remake itself as a competitive deepwater producer. Pemex’s chief executive, Emilio Lozoya, said that the company would delay some of its independent exploration plans in the Gulf of Mexico and look for deep-pocketed partners.

Mr. Lozoya argues that the company’s problems are manageable. “Pemex would be in a situation of real emergency if the energy reform hadn’t given us the instruments we now have to use money from third parties to carry out our investment projects,” he said in a recent radio interview.

As its financial position weakens, Pemex has begun to cut.

A long-delayed modernization at three refineries was postponed. The company didn’t renew the contracts of some 10,000 workers employed through outsourcing companies. Pemex also got the union to agree to some $650 million in cuts to perks and benefits, accept early retirement plans for older employees and leave unfilled positions vacant.

Pemex is even planning for the unthinkable: layoffs among its 150,000-strong work force, including members of its politically powerful union. “There would have to be a reduction,” Pedro Joaquín Coldwell, the energy secretary, said this week.

The government had hoped to move swiftly to open its oil fields to private investment, planning to offer monthly auctions for contracts on 169 different blocks, from the Gulf of Mexico to shale gas deposits on the Texas border. But gathering all the information for investors and designing attractive contracts is proving more complicated than expected.

Energy officials admit that a lot is riding on the results of the first auction in July, when the government will award a package of 14 exploration blocks in low-cost shallow waters. “Politically, the success of the first auction is the highest priority,” said Mr. Coldwell. “It’s the national and international reference.”

But the low oil price may delay plans for bids on expensive shale and other oil fields that are more complex.

“We are aware that certain areas will not be as interesting as they were when the barrel was over $100,” Lourdes Melgar, Mexico’s under secretary for hydrocarbons, said in an interview. “We don’t want because of the current situation to give away areas.”

As oil companies decide where to spend shrinking investment budgets, Mexico has an advantage, she argued.

“This is a highly productive oil area,” Ms. Melgar said. “We’re talking of an area where we know there are resources, both conventional and unconventional, and where we have a lot of diversity. You’re not talking about a frontier area.”

Political factors come into play as well. As a democracy bordering the United States, Mexico “is just in a different world” compared with oil producers such as Iraq and Nigeria, said Carlos Pascual, a former energy envoy for the United States State Department and currently a senior vice president at IHS, a consulting firm.

Unlike its Latin American competitors Venezuela and Argentina, which constantly change bidding rules, Mexico’s rules are stable and transparent, said Jorge Piñon, an energy analyst at the University of Texas Austin.

Still, the low prices forced the Mexican government to make changes last week on its initial proposed contracts. The new rules for the first exploration package and a second group of shallow-water production blocks to be awarded in September relax the minimum investment requirements. They also loosen restrictions on the types of companies and partnerships that are allowed to bid.

Perhaps most important, private investors will keep a larger percentage of their profits as their returns rise, whether because the oil price bounces back or because the field is more productive than expected. Profits are split with the government.

“We are under a different market scenario,” said Juan Carlos Zepeda, the president of the National Hydrocarbons Commission, the regulator charged with conducting the auctions.

While the changing market hasn’t altered the government’s goal of increasing output by 500,000 barrels a day, “experts say it’s very dubious,” said Jeremy Martin, director of the energy program at the Institute of the Americas in San Diego. Still, he says he believes that many oil companies remain interested in Mexico over the long term.

Others are more skeptical. David Shields, an oil analyst here, questioned whether production costs were as low as the government suggested. “The low-cost easy fields are running out,” he said, pointing to Pemex’s problems. “Just how this whole thing is going to play out I don’t know. The value of the exploration and production business has been cut in half.”

For now, oil companies are leaving their options open. Some 35 paid for access to a hermetic data room where they can study seismic information on the blocks. Of those, 23 have taken the first steps to qualify for bidding, including Shell, Chevron and Petrobras.

“We constantly have to look for additional resources,” said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration and Production Company. “Mexico is a long-term strategy for us.”

But he warned that the “fiscal terms will drive the opportunity.”

Although auctions for shale fields in northern Mexico may not go forward, the regulator, Mr. Zepeda, was confident that the deepwater one would. Mexico’s prospective reserves lie under the Gulf of Mexico in a region called the Perdido Fold Belt, where deepwater production has been successful in United States waters just to the north.

It takes eight years for a deepwater development to produce the first barrel of oil, he said, so companies look at the long-term price when they weigh their spending. “When you are turning to look at those projects,” he said, “the spot price is not very relevant.”","In Mexico Oil Market, Mood Moves From Excited to Anxious",2015-03-14,"As oil prices plunge, the government has scaled back its heady predictions of big-time investing while also taking steps to drum up interest.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/business/energy-environment/pemex-seeks-private-investment-as-mexico-oil-industry-falters.html
76,"A camp for workers in Northern Alberta, the heart of the oil sands, was permanently closed and another was temporarily shut. Several proposed oil sands projects and expansions are under review or have been deferred.

The cuts, though, won’t necessarily translate into lower production. Oil sands production is expected to increase by 25 percent, to 4.8 million barrels a day, according to January estimates by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, partly because of new projects moving into production.

The enormous projects are just too difficult to switch off, and the companies must keep pumping crude to cover the sizable debt on their multibillion-dollar investments. They also don’t want to cede market share to producers in other countries.

Imperial Oil, which is controlled by Exxon Mobil, said on Monday that fourth-quarter earnings dropped by 36 percent. Even so, the company plans to start production at two new oil sands projects this year.

“It really makes no economic sense to bring down production at this point because most of the costs are sunk,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ Equity.

While production may keep humming along, the big question is whether oil sands producers can break even at current prices.

An oil sands project takes five to 10 years to design and build, and they have a life span of 25 to 50 years. Fort Hills, a project now under construction in a partnership led by Suncor, has a budget of 13.5 billion Canadian dollars (about $10.7 billion).

Once such projects are up and running, the expenses are significant, given the process needed to get the oil-laden bitumen from the ground. It must either be dug up or blasted from under the ground using steam. Two energy-hungry steps are then needed to separate the bitumen from the sand and to turn it into usable oil known as synthetic crude.

A frequently cited study prepared for the United States State Department’s review of the Keystone XL pipeline estimated that many oil sands projects become unprofitable at prices of $65 to $75 a barrel. Prices are now below $50.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

But the State Department review, which was released in January 2014, doesn’t necessarily account for the changing environment.

Andrew Leach, an economist and professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta, said that the American figure inflated the break-even point by including a 12 percent profit margin for oil producers. The drop in the Canadian dollar has also provided an added cushion for domestic oil companies that are paid for their products in the now more valuable American currency.

When those factors are combined, Mr. Leach said, “you’re looking at a reduction of the growth rate at current prices, a stall.” He estimates that the production cost for synthetic crude from the major open pit mine projects is $31 to $39 a barrel, at current exchange rates. He added, though, that a few projects with production problems had much higher costs.

The industry thinking, he said, is, “I’m willing to burn through cash on this project because in the long term it will be worth it.”

As a result, most oil sands operators are reviewing future projects rather than considering production cuts or stopping projects already under construction. They are also looking to cut costs as swiftly as possible.

“Nobody in the oil industry feels very secure,” said Ken Smith, president of the Unifor union local that represents about 3,600 Suncor employees who operate the giant dump trucks and excavators. “We’re kind of at the mercy of these big players like the Saudis and Russia.”

Mr. Smith said he believed that none of Suncor’s 1,000 layoffs would involve his members. Sneh Seetal, a spokeswoman for Suncor, said the company had yet to determine the specifics, but noted that it would involve a mix of contract positions and employees spread across the company’s domestic operations, which include refining and gasoline retailing.

Companies in supporting roles — such as suppliers for safety boots and cleaning services — are feeling the most immediate squeeze.

The Fort McMurray branch of Finning International, a Caterpillar dealer that sold many of the $5 million to $6 million heavy-haul dump trucks, recently laid off about 60 workers. At the end of December, Civeo, which is based in Houston, said it was mothballing an oil sands work housing complex with 2,005 rooms and was permanently closing another with 510.

Trevor Haynes, the president and chief executive of the Black Diamond Group, another supplier of work housing based in Calgary, Alberta, said he was not yet being pressured to cut rates by oil companies and did not expect to have to close any of the housing in the oil sands. But that does not mean that he is sanguine.

“It comes down to one word, which is ‘uncertainty,’ ” Mr. Haynes said. “Those of us who have been around awhile have seen these periods before, so it feels familiar, if vaguely disconcerting.”

His main concern is that new construction projects may be indefinitely postponed. If so, he plans to fill the void by supplying housing to proposed liquefied natural gas plants in British Columbia as well as that province’s recently announced plan to build a major hydroelectric dam.

Not everyone is upset or worried about the slowdown in the oil sands. Melissa Blake, the mayor of the regional municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray and most of the major oil sands sites, said she welcomed it. After trying to keep up with a population increase of more than 125 percent since 2000, Ms. Blake said, Fort McMurray needs a break.

“The past few years have been just been catching up with the growth we’ve had,” the mayor said. “There’s a bit of an advantage from having a less robust industry.”

A break, Ms. Blake, said should allow the community’s infrastructure to finally catch up with its growth.

Ms. Blake said she had seen no obvious signs of a slowdown around town, like emptier stores and restaurants. But that, she said, is probably because most of the 79,000 full-time residents of Fort McMurray are in less vulnerable jobs. That’s probably not the case, she acknowledged, for about 39,000 people who fly in to work on oil sands projects but make their homes elsewhere, often on the other side of Canada.

But Ms. Blake acknowledged that if the slump in prices proved to be sustained, few would escape its effects.

77,"For Mr. Lee’s London firm and the shipping companies it serves, 2015 is shaping up to be a boom time, after a run of lean years for oil shippers. “What we do is sell space,” he said. “If our ships are utilized for considerable periods of time, the remaining ships can be sold at higher prices.”

Tankers International is the booking agent for a category of vessels known as Very Large Crude Carriers, state-of-the-art ships that are about 1,100 feet — more than a fifth of a mile — long. Their two-million-barrel capacity is equivalent to the daily output of a midsize oil-producing country like Norway. At current prices, those cargoes would typically be worth around $120 million.

There are about 600 supertankers of this class plying the world’s waterways, and Tankers International books jobs for about 40 of them. Many shipowners line up work themselves, but Mr. Lee’s firm is the agent for a group of five companies with shipping interests.

One is Euronav, a European operator, which holds a stake in Tankers International. Others include Trafigura, a Dutch multinational commodity trader, and Oak Maritime, a shipping business based in Hong Kong.

The computer terminals at Tankers International provide the 17 agents here with extensive intelligence on the ships of competitors, including not only where they are but when they will reach their next destinations and how much money they are making or losing. The information is an algorithmic mash-up of GPS data, intelligence on the financial details of chartering transactions and even the results of safety inspections.

While Tankers International is wary of disclosing information on the ships it manages, it makes available a free mobile app with data on competing vessels called VLCC Fixtures.

“We used to trade on gut feeling,” said Henrik Sick, the firm’s vice president for chartering. “Now we have better information than other people.”

And, oh, by the way: Cheaper oil means big savings for the shipowners, whose supertankers are powered by a heavy, petroleum-based fuel that is cheaper than it has been in years. That makes those longer trips all the more feasible.

“A glut of oil has to be good for the tanker industry,” said Simon Toyne, a maritime analyst at Genscape, a market research firm.

Not only do the longer distances and times earn more money for tanker owners, but ships that are tied up on lengthy voyages cannot be used elsewhere like the Persian Gulf — further tightening the market, which in turn lets the owners charge higher rates.

According to Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory firm based in New York, spot rates for chartering very large crude carriers have risen sharply in recent months. In January, when heating season in the Northern Hemisphere was keeping the supertankers especially busy, they were able to command charter rates as high as $69,000 a day. Recently they have eased off to the range of about $40,000 a day in anticipation of the second quarter of the year, which is almost always weak.

But even that is richer than the average rates of $22,000 last year and about $12,000 in 2013.

With an estimated break-even for shipowners of around $25,000 a day, Jonathan Chappell, a shipping analyst at Evercore, says he expects all of the nine publicly listed tanker companies he covers — which includes Euronav and two Bermuda-based companies, Teekay Tankers and DHT Holdings — to be profitable this year. Last year, four of the companies that Mr. Chappell tracks lost money; two were only marginally profitable.

Mr. Chappell says the tanker industry is “still in the early innings of a recovery.” That comes after a grim few years after the global financial crisis and economic slump, when shipowners were caught with a glut of ships that they ordered during the previous boom years in the early 2000s.

There is also a potentially lucrative side business for some tankers — one that perked up briefly early this year. The especially steep plunge in oil prices in January prompted commodity traders to take options on about 20 ships, with plans to use them as floating storage tanks. A few ships like the Alsace, which spent most of February and March fully loaded and anchored off Scotland’s Orkney Islands, have been put to this use.

Lately, considering a recent spike in oil prices because of Middle East tensions, this buy low, sell high storage strategy has looked less appealing.

Executives like Patrick Rodgers, chief executive of Euronav, one of the largest tanker companies, say they hope interest in using tankers for storage will return this year. Supply will continue to exceed demand, the thinking goes, and storage on land, which is already tight in the United States, will continue to fill up, depressing prices. “We will see there being real demand and stimulus for storing oil and that where it will be stored is on ships,” he recently told analysts.

But for now, the real money will continue to be made on those slow boats to China.","Oil Glut Is a Boon to Shippers, as Buyers Stock Up at Low Prices",2015-04-02,"Although petroleum prices are down worldwide, the business of sending supertankers across the seas has never been brisker &#8212; or more global.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/business/international/oil-shippers-take-advantage-of-a-new-boom.html
78,"West Texas Intermediate crude, for example, dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years, and Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell more than 6 percent, to under $53 a barrel.

The drop in prices has led to a rising tide of oil company announcements in recent days of investment cuts for the coming months. Ensign Energy Services, a Canadian drilling contractor, reported that it would be laying off 700 workers, or roughly 10 percent of its work force, in California fields. Several Texas-based companies that have borrowed heavily in recent years to produce in new Texas and North Dakota shale fields are expected to announce steep investment and job cuts in the coming days.

Consumers continued to benefit from the oil price collapse, with the AAA auto club reporting on Monday that the average national price for regular gasoline had fallen to $2.20 a gallon, 8 cents lower than a week ago, 51 cents lower than a month ago, and $1.11 below a year ago. Energy experts say American families are likely to have as much as $115 billion more in disposable income in 2015 than last year because of lower gasoline prices alone. Additional benefits should come from drops in heating oil and diesel prices.

The last time oil and gasoline prices fell this low was in the wake of the 2008-9 financial collapse, when crude oil fell from well over $100 to below $40 a barrel in a matter of months. Energy analysts say the current price slump is of an entirely different nature, based primarily on a glut of oil being produced in the United States, along with increased production in Canada, Iraq and a handful of other countries.

While in the past the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has sometimes agreed to cut back production to shore up prices, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf producers have decided to protect their global market share by cutting prices in the United States and Asian markets while increasing production somewhat.

In a recent interview with Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications, based in Cyprus, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, indicated his country would remain steadfast rather than cut production anytime soon. “If I reduce, what happens to my market share?” Mr. Naimi said. “The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, U.S. shale oil producers will take my share.”

Adding further pressure to prices is the weakening demand for oil and petroleum products in Europe and developing nations. That weakness is compounded as increasingly efficient vehicles come onto the market and China seeks to reduce the oil dependence of its economy.

“It might be the dead of winter, but it looks as though markets will confront considerably more downside risk in the months ahead,” according to a Citi Research report released Sunday night, “and it will likely take well into the year before prices will bottom, let alone achieve a new equilibrium.”

Citi says it is most probable that the oil market will stabilize by the end of 2015, with the Brent price averaging $63 a barrel for the year — several dollars above the current price. But its more bearish forecast, with a 30 percent probability, is for Brent to average $55 for the year, roughly the current price.

Signs suggest that oil and oil product supplies will soon be increasing. The ramping up of several refineries in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is likely to increase exports of products like gasoline and diesel by 500,000 barrels a day in the coming months. Even without the Keystone XL pipeline, other Canadian pipelines coming online will bring as much as 350,000 more barrels onto the market.

Citi has projected that global investments in oil exploration and production will decline up to 15 percent this year, but American companies continue to produce more efficiently. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian global consulting firm, issued a report on Monday saying that the average break-even price for the principal shale fields in the United States had dropped to $58 a barrel, with the core areas of some fields remaining economical to produce at $50.

Oil-producing states are expected to suffer economically from the oil price drop, although the top oil-producing state, Texas, has worked hard to diversify its economy after the price bust of the 1980s. With a projected $3.5 billion budget deficit, Alaska has already announced a delay in six important infrastructure projects, including a gas pipeline from the North Slope.","Oil&#8217;s Fall Continues Into 2015, and Stock Markets Shudder",2015-01-06,"West Texas crude oil dipped below $50, and the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 300 points on a day of volatility.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/business/oils-fall-continues-to-below-50-a-barrel.html

MANAGERS of three of the better-performing mutual funds of the second quarter toted up their returns by hewing to the old-time virtue of patience.

All three like to hang on to favored companies for years, while the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over two-thirds of its portfolio annually. They’re bulldogs in a world full of whippets.

The Dividend Hunters

Daniel Peris, co-manager of the Federated Strategic Value Dividend fund, says he aims to buy stocks that his fund can own for as long as they make sense for the portfolio and that he bases his selections on his three- to five-year projections of their dividend growth. The fund’s annual turnover ratio of 14.6 percent equates to an average holding period of about 6.5 years.

Low turnover isn’t the only retro quality of the fund, which Mr. Peris manages with Walter C. Bean and Deborah D. Bickerstaff. The managers specialize in buying shares of companies with robust, rising dividends, even as dividends have often fallen out of fashion. “In the last 25 years, the U.S. has gone anti-dividend,” Mr. Peris said. Many companies instead hoard cash or make shareholder payouts via stock repurchases.

Those with beefy dividends — utilities are the archetype — are regarded by some investors as stodgy and dull. Mr. Peris said they were better termed predictable. “These are older global corporations with long records of dividend payment and dividend growth,” he said. “The weight of history is on them to keep paying.” (A common stock’s total return consists of its price appreciation plus dividends.)

Such well-known names as AT&T, Kraft Foods and GlaxoSmithKline are among the bigger holdings of the fund.

Mr. Peris and his colleagues invest about a quarter of the portfolio abroad. That compares with about 5 percent for the fund’s Morningstar peers.

Besides GlaxoSmithKline, foreign companies among the fund’s recent top 20 holdings have included the oil drillers Royal Dutch Shell and Total and the drug makers Merck and AstraZeneca.

Mr. Peris’s fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.8 percent for its institutional shares, returned 8.6 percent in the second quarter, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index returned 5.2 percent, including dividends.

Big Bets on Brazil

The T. Rowe Price Latin America fund, managed by Verena E. Wachnitz, sticks with stocks even longer than the Federated fund does. Its annual turnover ratio is only 13 percent.

Ms. Wachnitz took over the fund in March, after working as an analyst with T. Rowe Price for about a decade. She predicted that, under her stewardship, turnover would rise but stay lower than average. “It will remain consistent with a three- to five-year investment horizon,” she said.

A theme in her portfolio is companies that will benefit from the growth of the consumer economy. She said she sees companies such as Lojas Renner, based in Brazil, as a way to benefit from a swelling middle class in Latin America. The company was one of the fund’s top holdings on May 31.

A leading apparel retailer in Brazil, Lojas Renner “has opportunities to grow and to improve its margins and efficiency,” she said. “It should do well over the medium to long term, regardless of the economic outlook in Brazil.”

T. Rowe Price is known for a growth-at-a-reasonable-price philosophy of stock-picking, and Ms. Wachnitz follows that approach. She said she mostly avoids companies in regulated sectors, like utilities and telecommunications, and those in mining, long a stalwart in South America. “We’re more selective in those industries because we see fewer growth opportunities,” she said.

In contrast, a place where the fund will almost surely continue to invest is Brazil. Running a Latin America fund necessarily means making a big bet on the country, as it’s the region’s largest economy. Brazilian stocks account for more than half of the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index and 54.7 percent of Ms. Wachnitz’s fund.

Brazil has lately received much attention because of the World Cup, but a bigger factor for investors may be its election in October. President Dilma Rousseff is seeking re-election, and her policies have led to investor concern about Petrobras, the state-controlled oil and gas giant, Ms. Wachnitz said.

“Government intervention remains a key risk,” she said. “The government hasn’t allowed Petrobras to increase prices at the pump as much as it should have. It seems to be prioritizing its needs over the needs of the company.” Still, Petrobras is one of her fund’s bigger holdings because of its hefty oil and gas reserves and its potential for production growth, she said.

The fund, with an expense ratio of 1.33 percent, returned 7.2 percent in the second quarter.

Energy for the Long Run

State-controlled energy companies also make up a chunk of the Guinness Atkinson Global Energy fund, though Petrobras isn’t among them. Instead, the fund, co-managed by Tim Guinness, Will Riley and Jonathan Raghorn, holds such state affiliates as PetroChina; Statoil, the Norwegian oil and gas driller; and Gazprom of Russia.

Mr. Guinness said his fund has owned Gazprom for about 18 months. He hung on when Russia annexed Crimea, even though some investors bailed out. “We bought it because it was incredibly cheap,” he said. “We were alive to the Russian risk, but the valuation was irresistible. The stock lost 15 percent, but it’s recovering.”

The shares have performed well enough lately that Gazprom has grown into the fund’s biggest holding as of May 31.

Clinging to a stock, even when it faces tumult, is typical of Mr. Guinness. His fund has a turnover ratio of 8 percent; when he likes an investment, he stays put, even if the price zigzags. “I believe in buying and holding,” he said. “I don’t think our skill set is trading, and it keeps our transaction costs down.”

Mr. Guinness, though based in London, tilts toward the United States for the fund’s investments: American companies accounted for 46.5 percent of the portfolio on May 31. Top holdings included Apache, an oil and gas driller, and Valero Energy.

The American emphasis grows out of the nature of the energy business, he said. “About half of the world’s oil and gas companies are domiciled in America, so our allocation has been about 45 percent to 50 percent from the get-go,” he said.

Mr. Guinness has managed the fund since it began in 2004. It returned 14 percent in the second quarter and has an expense ratio of 1.34 percent.","Sticking to Their Guns, Fund Managers Reaped Big Returns",2014-07-13,Patience was key to the strong performance of three mutual funds in the second quarter.

80,"But Fed officials also have underscored in recent weeks that their policy decisions will be determined by the course of events, not by their predictions. And some analysts said on Friday that it seemed increasingly likely the Fed would once again decide to wait a little longer before finally raising interest rates.

“In light of the downward pressure on inflation, we expect the F.O.M.C. will be ‘patient’ this year as far as monetary policy is concerned,” Ryan Wang, United States economist at HSBC, wrote in a note to clients on Friday, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy. “We believe the committee will hold off any increase in the federal funds rate until September, waiting for evidence that both total and core inflation have bottomed out and are beginning to rise again.”

The Fed aims to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, and Friday’s report is worse than it looks because the Fed prefers a different government measure that tends to show somewhat less inflation. That measure, the index of personal consumption expenditures, will be updated later this month.

Separately, the Fed reported that industrial production fell by 0.1 percent in December, driven mostly by a sharp drop in utility output caused mostly by a swing from an unusually cold November to an unusually warm December. A 0.3 percent increase in manufacturing and a 2.2 gain jump in mining, which showed that crude oil production was continuing to advance despite the drop in prices, offset most of the drop in utility output.

The sharp decline of oil prices is a crucial factor in the low inflation figures. The government said the price of gasoline fell 21 percent over the last year, and analysts said cheap gas also appeared to be holding down the cost of some other goods and services. But oil prices cannot continue to fall at the same pace, and surveys of economists and consumers show a widespread expectation that inflation will rebound.

The University of Michigan’s consumer survey reported on Friday that expectations for inflation over the next year declined substantially to 2.4 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December. Crucially, however, the survey reported no change in consumer expectations for annual inflation five years from now.

“The bottom line is that permanently lower energy prices are a stimulus package for U.S. consumers,” Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, wrote on Friday. “Stronger final demand should speed up inflation’s return to 2 percent, not slow it down or make it less likely.”

The weakness of inflation, however, predates the collapse of oil prices. The Fed has not hit its 2 percent target in more than two years. And the data suggests other factors, including a strengthening dollar, are restraining inflation. The prices of imported goods like clothing and cars also have fallen in recent months.

Notably, a version of the consumer index that excludes oil and food did not rise in December. The Fed and many independent economists regard this measure, known as core inflation, as a more accurate indicator of future inflation because oil and food prices are volatile, obscuring the underlying trend.

Measures of inflation expectations derived from asset prices suggested that some investors had doubts about how quickly inflation was likely to rebound — and they are increasingly betting the Fed will wait until the fall to raise rates.

The Fed, however, has not significantly altered its timetable in more than a year, and officials have said they will not wait for inflation to recover before acting. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said last month that it would be sufficient for officials to feel “reasonably confident” that inflation was going to rebound.

James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Friday that the Fed was being pulled in opposite directions by the growing strength of the economy and the weakness of inflation. He noted that the Fed had underestimated job growth and overestimated inflation in each of the last two years.

But Mr. Bullard, speaking in Chicago, said that on balance, based on current economic conditions, he was inclined to think that the time had come to raise rates. “The level of inflation is not so low that it can alone justify a policy rate of zero,” he said.",Slow Rise in Consumer Prices May Stymie the Fed,2015-01-17,"The slow pace of inflation means Americans are experiencing less erosion in the value of their paychecks at a time when wages, too, are rising slowly.

GENEVA — The sharp drop in oil prices and stronger global economic growth are expected to bolster airline profits by as much as 26 percent next year, an industry group said Wednesday.

But only some of those gains are likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of lower airfares, because of billions of dollars in planned investments in new aircraft and expanding flight networks.

The International Air Transport Association, an industry group based in Geneva, estimated that the world’s airlines would report a 26 percent jump in collective net profit, to a record $25 billion. That would be up from an expected $19.9 billion in 2014 and more than double the nearly $11 billion in combined profit in 2013.

“There’s no doubt that the recent fall in the oil price is a relief for airlines,” Tony Tyler, the association’s director general and chief executive told journalists here.

The trade group, which represents most of the world’s airlines, said it based its 2015 forecasts on the assumption of an average price of $85 a barrel of crude oil, which is refined into kerosene for use as jet fuel. That would represent the lowest fuel prices for the industry since 2010.

Fuel is the largest operating expense for airlines, accounting in recent years for as much as two-fifths of total costs. But a sharp increase in American production of oil has led to a jump in global supplies, pushing crude oil prices down by about 40 percent this year.

While many consumers are accustomed to seeing such price drops reflected relatively quickly in the price of gas, airline passengers have usually had to wait to see any drop in ticket prices.

One reason is the fact that airlines buy their fuel in advance, locking them into higher fixed prices for several months, even when market prices fall.

“If you’ve already bought and paid for your turkey for next Thanksgiving, and prices come down in the meantime, you won’t get any benefit from any subsequent reduction in turkey prices,” said John Strickland, an independent airline consultant in London. In addition, he said that airlines “also swallowed the pain of rapidly rising prices in the last year or so” that have not been fully reflected in fares.

Others noted that other significant operating expenses — labor is one major expense, airport and infrastructure taxes are another — remain high across much of the airline industry.

And so the short-term relief to consumers is often less pronounced in air travel than the one they see at the gas pump.

Nonetheless, the association hailed falling fuel prices as a boon for the roughly 3.5 billion people who travel by air each year.

“This is unambiguously good news for consumers,” said Brian Pearce, the group’s chief economist. He predicted that average round-trip passenger fares would fall by 5.1 percent next year — before taxes and surcharges — after adjusting for inflation, while the cost of shipping cargo by air would fall by nearly 6 percent compared with 2014.

Given that fuel represents, on average, about a quarter of airlines’ current operating expenses, a 5 percent drop in fares “is pretty much a full pass-through from the industry,” Mr. Pearce said.

The association said airlines were expected to plow a major portion of their growing profits into purchases of newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Those purchases are expected to exceed $4.5 trillion over the next 20 years.

Airlines in North America — where a wave of mergers in recent years has left four big carriers controlling about 80 percent of seat capacity — are expected to see the largest profit gains next year, the association said.

Net income for North American carriers is expected to hit $13.2 billion in 2015, up 11 percent from $11.9 billion this year. Profits in 2013 were $7.2 billion. Per passenger, net profits are expected to reach $15.54 next year.

Combined earnings among European airlines are also expected to improve, despite slowing economic growth in the region and intensifying competition. Net profits in Europe are forecast to reach $4 billion in 2015, up 48 percent from $2.7 billion this year.

Mr. Tyler said the European improvement was encouraging. But he noted that high regulatory costs, infrastructure inefficiency and “onerous” taxation meant that European airline profit margins per passenger — at just 1.8 percent — remained a fraction of the 6 percent margins earned by their counterparts in the United States.

Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to see profits rise next year to $5 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2014.

Profits for Middle Eastern carriers — whose seat capacity is growing at nearly 16 percent a year, far above the global average — will rise to $1.6 billion, from $1.1 billion this year, according to the association’s forecast.","Airlines Expect Big Rise in Profits in 2015, as Fuel Costs Drop",2014-12-11,"A 26 percent jump in collective profit was forecast by an industry group, which also estimated passengers would see fares drop 5 percent on average.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/business/airlines-expect-big-rise-in-profits-in-2015-as-fuel-costs-drop.html

HOUSTON — In the biggest retrenchment in the United States as oil prices fall, Sasol has delayed an expansive $14 billion project in southwestern Louisiana to make diesel out of natural gas.

The project, which had not yet been approved by the company, was to create at least 1,200 permanent jobs and 7,000 construction jobs, and begin production in 2018. But with the price of oil down by more than 50 percent since June, the highly speculative, and expensive, project was economically impractical. The announcement was the most extreme example of how oil companies are delaying, or canceling outright, some of their more ambitious projects as the price of oil plunges.

Total, the French oil giant, has announced a 10 percent reduction in capital investments, including in American shale fields. And Hess has said it will halve the number of rigs it deploys in the North Dakota Bakken shale field, where oil is more expensive to extract than in traditional wells.

“The shock of the price collapse has worn off, and the budget-cutting knives are out,” said Daniel Yergin, an energy historian. “People are going through a process of real re-examination, reflecting what they see as the new tougher reality of prices.”

Worldwide, investments in petroleum projects will be cut an estimated $100 billion, or 15 percent, this year, according to the International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris.

The Sasol project depended on two dynamics in the energy markets: oil prices remaining high and natural gas prices staying low, because the conversion process for producing diesel is expensive and highly complex. Now any diesel produced by the plant would almost surely cost more than diesel produced by conventional refiners.

In a short statement, Sasol, a South African company known for its boldness, said it had not decided to terminate the project indefinitely. But it added, “As a result of the ongoing capital investment reprioritization exercise, Sasol has decided to delay the final investment decision.” The announcement said the decision was part of “a comprehensive plan to conserve cash in response to lower international oil prices.”

No sign suggests the price of oil will snap back soon with the global market oversaturated by nearly two million barrels a day. On Wednesday, global oil benchmark prices swooned again, falling between 2 percent and 4 percent, after the Energy Department reported record domestic stockpiles of crude.

The steep drop was reflected in the quarterly earnings reported Wednesday by Hess, the first major oil company to report results this season. With revenues dropping in the fourth quarter by 19 percent to $2.53 billion, the company posted a net loss of $8 million compared with a profit of $1.93 billion a year ago (which included after tax gains from asset sales of $1.34 billion).

“Our whole focus here is to maintain our financial strength and flexibility while still preserving our long-term growth options,” John B. Hess, the chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. “But we do believe, with the decrease in investment programs for the industry and the consequent leveling out of production growth, oil prices will recover starting next year.”

Cenovus Energy, a major independent Canadian producer, announced it was slashing its 2015 investment budget by roughly 15 percent, or more than $560 million, by suspending most of its conventional drilling in Saskatchewan and south Alberta.

And Weatherford International, a large oil services company, announced it was eliminating its chief operating officer position to flatten its management structure and cut costs.

But the Sasol move is the single largest investment cut or delay in the recent downturn, at least in the United States.

Having already built smaller plants in Qatar and South Africa, Sasol had intended for its new plant in Westlake, La., to produce 96,000 barrels of fuel a day using the “gas-to-liquids” technology, known as G.T.L., conceived by German scientists in the 1920s to produce liquid fuels without using oil. Only a handful of gas-to-liquids plants operate commercially globally, in Malaysia, South Africa and Qatar.

“In order for the G.T.L. technology to pay, it has to use inexpensive natural gas and sell into a high-priced market, the $100-a-barrel oil market we have grown accustomed to the last few years,” said Don Hertzmark, an international energy consultant who has worked on gas-to-liquids and other global natural gas projects for three decades. “That cost advantage has collapsed, taking with it the profit potential for G.T.L. in the United States at least for now.”

The gas-to-liquids technology has a mixed record at best. The largest plant in operation, Royal Dutch Shell’s Pearl plant, north of Doha, Qatar, cost the leviathan sum of $19 billion, more than three times its original projected cost, and was plagued with unexpected maintenance problems.

BP and ConocoPhillips built and briefly operated demonstration plants in Alaska and Oklahoma, but stopped short of full development of the technology. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips announced plans to build giant plants in Qatar, but backed out, putting their capital instead into terminals to export liquefied natural gas.",Oil Company Sasol Delays Huge Louisiana Project as Prices Slide,2015-01-29,"The $14 billion project, which had not received final approval from Sasol, was to begin production in 2018, creating some 1,200 permanent jobs.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/business/oil-company-delays-huge-louisiana-project-as-prices-slide.html
83,"HOUSTON — Oil prices suddenly spiked more than 8 percent on Friday, in the biggest one-day price move for the volatile commodity in nearly three years. But most energy experts said it was too soon to say whether any meaningful shift was underway.

Traders and energy experts said the sudden move up — after oil prices had plummeted by more than 50 percent since June — could be explained by various factors, including reports that the Islamic State terrorist group was advancing in an offensive near Iraq’s northern oil fields.

The sharp rise came in the final 45 minutes of the trading day, with the West Texas Intermediate benchmark rising just over $3.71 to $48.24 a barrel. The global Brent benchmark rose to above $50 — still a long way from the $100-a-barrel levels energy executives have grown accustomed to in recent years.

The rally came shortly after the Baker Hughes service company reported that the nation’s rig count had dropped by 94, or 7 percent, in the last week, the largest single-week drop since the late 1980s. That leaves 1,223 rigs in operation, the lowest number in three years, and energy executives say another 300 rigs could be decommissioned in the next few months as service contracts expire.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

A drop in oil production normally happens several months after rigs are decommissioned, but the Baker Hughes report was another sign that oil companies were responding fast to the global oil glut by cutting their spending.

Chevron, the nation’s second-largest oil and gas producer after Exxon Mobil, reported on Friday that it was dropping its 2015 exploration and production budget by 13 percent. It was the latest in a string of company reports over the last few weeks suggesting that as much as $100 billion in petroleum investments would be cut worldwide this year.

“My gut says the oil price has been artificially low, and I think this is a logical correction from that overreaction,” said Joel Moser, the chief executive at Aquamarine Investment Partners. “It would not surprise me at all that this may reflect a bottom.”

Oil prices were soaring last summer when the Islamic State staged an offensive through western and northern Iraq. But the group never interrupted the most important oil production and export activities.

Within months, the offensive had actually driven the Baghdad government and the Kurdistan regional government closer together, for mutual security. That helped promote better energy coordination, which increased exports.

The Energy Department reported on Friday that Iraqi oil production had increased in the second half of 2014.

But renewed Islamic State attacks on Kurdish positions outside the city of Kirkuk raised the risks that Iraqi production could be in jeopardy again, renewing concerns about global supplies. Energy experts say the world supply is only about 1.5 to 2 million barrels a day above demand, so instability in the Middle East has the potential to rapidly change the oil price outlook.

American and international oil companies are taking no chances and they are preparing for at least several months of low oil prices.

On the day after ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum announced quarterly losses and sharp cuts in 2015 investments, Chevron on Friday reported lower profits and said it would suspend stock buybacks.

John Watson, Chevron’s chief executive, was cautiously optimistic but he emphasized that more investment cuts might be necessary.

“Although commodity prices have fallen recently, we believe long-term market fundamentals remain attractive,” he said. But he added, “We will continue to monitor and be responsive to market conditions, and to actively pursue cost reductions throughout our supply chain in order to lower overall outlays.”",Oil Prices Surge 8% After Long Slide Down,2015-01-31,"Energy experts said the sudden increase could be explained by various factors, including reports that the Islamic State terrorist group was advancing in an offensive near Iraq&#8217;s northern oil fields.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-surge-8-after-long-slide-down.html
84,"HOUSTON — After enduring frigid temperatures and higher energy costs last winter, many American consumers will spend considerably less this winter, mostly because a warmer season is forecast, the Energy Department projected on Tuesday.

The roughly half of American households that heat with natural gas can expect a decline of 5 percent in their gas expenditures despite slightly higher residential prices as homes use 10 percent less gas, the department estimated in its report on winter fuels.

Homes that rely on heating oil, mostly in the Northeast, can expect to spend 15 percent less this winter because of the recent drop in world oil prices. Homes that heat primarily with electricity, the norm through most of the South, can expect to save 2 percent, with 3 percent higher prices but 5 percent less consumption.

But the biggest savers will be the mostly rural and Midwestern users of propane who are expected to spend 34 percent less this winter, because of 24 percent lower prices and 13 percent lower consumption. Millions of Americans struggled to heat their homes last winter because there was a shortage of propane, not only because of the cold weather but also because more propane than usual was used to dry corn after a particularly wet harvest.

“U.S. households in all regions of the country can expect to pay lower heating bills this winter,” Adam Sieminski, administrator of the United States Energy Information Administration, said in a statement, “because temperatures are forecast to be warmer than last winter and that means less demand for heat.”

Gasoline consumers can also expect lower prices. Regular gasoline retail prices fell to an average of $3.41 a gallon in September, from an average of $3.69 a gallon in June, and the Energy Department projects further drops to $3.14 a gallon in December. The annual national average has fallen from $3.51 a gallon in 2013 to a projected $3.45 for 2014 and $3.38 a gallon for 2015.

The lower energy prices should help consumers, especially working-class families that spend a high proportion of their income on fuels, and retail and restaurant businesses. Many industries, including airlines and manufacturers of petrochemicals, chemicals and plastics, are also helped by lower energy prices that bring down their costs and increase their profits.

The average family that uses natural gas for heating will spend $649 this winter, the Energy Department projects, compared to $680 last winter, a three-year high. Spot gas prices spiked last winter because of the limited natural gas pipeline capacity, particularly in New York and New England.

Much of the lower price for energy can be attributed to the soaring production of oil and natural gas in shale fields in Texas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and several other states.

The Energy Department noted that daily oil production in September averaged 8.7 million barrels, the highest monthly total since July 1986. Natural gas production is also rising, and there has been a record build in inventories largely because of the “mild summer that resulted in less electricity generation to meet air-conditioning demand,” Mr. Sieminski said in a statement.

The Energy Department report said that the latest forecasts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the coming winter, which it noted could change, show much warmer weather than last winter east of the Rocky Mountains. The Midwest is predicted to be 16 percent warmer, the South 12 percent warmer and the Northeast 11 percent warmer.",Home Heating Costs Likely to Be Cheaper This Winter,2014-10-08,"The Energy Department says a warmer season is expected, saving natural gas customers 5 percent on their heating bill and propane customers 34 percent.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/business/energy-environment/us-consumer-energy-costs-expected-to-decline-this-winter.html
85,"LONDON — The downdraft in oil prices showed no sign of abating on Friday.

The main international benchmark, Brent crude, fell about 3 percent to about $61.80 barrel, a five-year low. That dip came a day after the American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, fell below the psychologically significant $60 a barrel level in the United States for the first time since 2009.

The International Energy Agency added to downward price pressures on Friday by cutting its forecast for global demand for crude oil in 2015.

For now, analysts say, there seems to be no safety net for oil prices.

“In the very short term prices can go lower; the market is weighted to very bearish sentiment,” Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm, said Friday.

European stocks fell on Friday, posting their biggest weekly loss since mid-2011 as energy stocks were hurt by the slide in oil prices. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 index lost 5.8 percent for the week. On Wall Street, stocks were lower around midday in New York.

“This is a blood bath,” said Pierre Martin, a trader at Saxo Bank. “After such a negative week, there’s not even a rebound into the close. The fact that oil can’t find a floor is spooking market players.”

Analysts say a major cut in production would be needed next year to avoid an inventory buildup and to stabilize falling prices. But hopes of a supply cut were dashed late last month when OPEC declined to change its output ceilings at a meeting in Vienna.

Despite the continued fall in prices since then, OPEC shows little sign of uniting to make production cuts. ""Why should we cut production?” Ali Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, said Wednesday on the sidelines of a climate-change conference in Lima, Peru.

A test of strength appears to be occurring among the Saudis and their equally prosperous Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and other producers like Venezuela and Iran, which can much less easily afford a long bout of low prices. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E. have about $1.5 trillion in financial assets among them, which is “plenty to meet their spending needs for the next few years,” said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London.

On the other hand, Venezuela, Nigeria and others are “going to have to cut back on spending,” said Ms. Ziemba. Already, Venezuela’s foreign minister and main oil policy maker has said it may be necessary to call an emergency OPEC meeting if the price rout continues.

The Saudis and their allies argue that to cut production now to raise prices would be to subsidize competitors like the companies extracting oil from shale in the United States, which are responsible for recent big additions to world oil supplies. The Saudis, whose costs for producing oil are low, are betting that low prices will lead to a shakeout of higher-cost producers like the shale companies. At the least, the Saudis appear to want all of OPEC to participate in any trims, analysts say.

Various forecasters have been stoking market fears by issuing forecasts of a growing glut next year. OPEC sent a shudder through the markets Wednesday when it forecast that demand for its own crude would be well below the ceiling that it recently declined to lower.

On Friday, the International Energy Agency, in Paris, said in its December oil market report that demand was likely to be 230,000 barrels per day less than previously forecast. The main reasons for the lowered forecast were less oil consumption in countries that produce it like Russia and a weaker-than-expected global economy.

A trim of 230,000 barrels per day is minimal in a global market of about 93 million barrels per day. But the lower forecast, the fourth by the agency in the past five months, reinforced the sentiment that supply is likely to exceed demand substantially next year.

The drop in oil prices is a blessing and curse for Europe, which is struggling to break free of the economic stagnation that has dogged the region since the global financial crisis.

The European Central Bank is fighting to keep inflation in positive territory, and falling fuel prices, while providing a stimulus to consumer spending, also contribute to the deflationary pressure in the region. Inflation is near zero in the eurozone, and Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, is under increasing pressure to enact radical monetary stimulus measures to keep prices from contracting.

Olivier Jakob, an oil analyst at Petromatrix, in Zug, Switzerland, said that he had expected Brent prices to fall no lower than $60 a barrel, but that now it appeared that floor might be breached. Even if market momentum carries it below that $60 level for a time, he said, “it would be difficult to sustain,” because producers would take action, perhaps by cutting output, and some marginally profitable operations would be forced to shut down.

For producing nations, the fall in oil prices is causing real pain, stressing government budgets and exacerbating internal tensions. Venezuela is the most exposed, Mr. Jakob said, as “the markets are already pricing in a default.”

Russia, heavily dependent on oil revenue for government spending and weighed down by Western sanctions over Ukraine, and Nigeria, where producing areas have a long history of ethnic unrest, are also feeling the strain, he said. The ruble fell about 2 percent against the dollar on Friday, to trade at 57.58 rubles.","Energy Agency Cuts Oil Demand Forecast, Adding to Pressure on Prices",2014-12-13,"The International Energy Agency said that demand for oil in 2015 was likely to be 230,000 barrels per day less than previously predicted.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/business/international-energy-agency-cuts-oil-demand-forecast.html

HOUSTON — Falling oil and gasoline prices have sent oil company stocks tumbling, but oil experts say the boom in American energy production shows no signs of slowing down, keeping the market flush with crude and gasoline prices low.

Even after a drop of as much as 25 percent in oil prices since early summer, several government and private reports say that it would take a drop of $10 to $20 a barrel more — to as low as $60 a barrel — to slow production even modestly.

On the downside, taxes and royalties on oil will decline, potentially cutting into the finances of oil-producing states like Texas, Alaska, Oklahoma and North Dakota. And it will continue to put pressure on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output to support prices, as well as cause economic pain to big producers like Russia, Venezuela and Iran.

Current production levels can be sustained in the shale fields in 2015 even if the Brent global oil benchmark, which fell to just under $84 a barrel at one point this week, dropped to as low as $60 to $65, according to Rystad Energy, an international oil and gas consultancy based in Norway.

“Oil output will respond very slowly to a drop in oil prices,” Bjornar Tonhaugen, vice president for oil and gas markets at Rystad Energy, wrote in a report released this week. “Markets may even be oversupplied next year more than previously thought.”

Slowing American oil production is like slowing a freight train moving at high speed. The current production of 8.7 million barrels a day, the highest in nearly a quarter-century, is more than a million barrels a day higher than it was only a year ago. Most companies make their investment decisions well in advance and need months to slow exploration because of contracts with service companies. And if they do decide to cut back some drilling, they will pick the least prospective fields first as they continue developing the richest prospects.

The Energy Department this week reported that only 4 percent of shale production in North Dakota, Texas and other states needed an oil price above $80 a barrel for producers to break even on investments. One reason is that improved efficiencies in hydraulic fracturing and other modern production techniques have increased the output of each new well month after month in recent years.

For example, the Energy Department expects that new oil production from new wells in the North Dakota Bakken shale field will increase by seven barrels a day next month over this month, and in the Texas Eagle Ford field by eight barrels a day. Put together, over a couple of months that translates into tens of thousands of new barrels every day across the country, with no increase in investment.

Sadad Al Husseini, the former head of exploration and production at Saudi Aramco, predicted that the United States would add a million more barrels of oil in daily production over the next year.

Pressure on Oil Economies The falling price of oil creates varying degrees of financial difficulties for countries that rely heavily on its export. According to research by Deutsche Bank, the point at which their national budgets break even varies from about $125 a barrel for Iran to less than $75 for Kuwait. Break-even point for national budgets A country above the price of oil predicts a budget deficit, below it, a surplus. $140 a barrel IRAN 120 VENEZUELA RUSSIA Price of oil 100 IRAQ SAUDI ARABIA Wednesday $84 80 KUWAIT 60 J F M A M J J A S O

“What is softening prices is weaker demand because of the global economy and the growing volume of North American production,” Mr. Al Husseini said in an interview. “So will prices bottom? It depends on what comes from the U.S.”

He added that when investors start seeing $75 to $80 oil, that will cut back some ambitions, and that could mean “a leveling off of new supplies by midyear 2015.”

The United States has banned most oil exports for four decades, but the expanded production has slashed imports from many OPEC countries, forcing them to drop their prices in Asia. The United States is also expanding its exports of refined products like gasoline and diesel, which are allowed, and that is cutting into production from other countries.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which accumulates and analyzes data for the industrialized nations, this week identified deep water offshore production, the Canadian oil sands and some of the American oil shale fields as the most susceptible to cuts in investment and production when oil prices fall. But only about 8 percent of these types of production require $80 a barrel oil to break even.

All told, the I.E.A. said only about 2.6 million barrels out of total world production of just over 90 million barrels requires a break-even price of $80, including some fields in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Russia, which are high-cost fields in part because of how much the governments require producers to pay them in taxes and royalties.

Global and American benchmark oil prices bounced back a bit on Friday, ranging between roughly $83 and $86. The American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, fell below $80 for the first time in two years briefly Thursday morning, and some oil experts say it could break the symbolic threshold again in coming days.

Lower oil prices mean lower prices at the pump for American consumers. The average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $3.14, 10 cents lower than it was a week ago and 22 cents lower than a year ago, according to the AAA motor club. That is the lowest price in more than three years.

Roughly a third of the nation’s gas stations are selling gasoline for less than $3 a gallon. The average American family saves about $120 a year for every dime drop in the gasoline price, experts say.

Many oil experts say that Saudi Arabia and several other OPEC countries that have shaved their prices in recent days are trying to drive down global production, and particularly American and Canadian production, to protect their market share. But with a growing population and struggling to tamp down potential domestic unrest, Saudi Arabia carries a rising social service budget that is financed almost entirely by oil money.

Over the long term, it may need to stretch its production as much as or more than the United States.

“For the government to balance budgets on an ongoing basis, higher oil prices are inevitably required,” Badr H. Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, a United Arab Emirates-based oil and gas company, said in an email exchange. “Otherwise, if oil prices continue to fall, maximizing production may be an imperative to securing required higher revenues, and that in turn might have a catastrophic effect with the creation of a major glut.”","Despite Slumping Prices, No End in Sight for U.S. Oil Production Boom ",2014-10-18,"Even after a fall of as much as 25 percent in oil prices, several reports say it would take a drop of $10 to $20 more a barrel to slow production even modestly.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/business/energy-environment/us-oil-boom-shows-no-signs-of-slowing-down.html
87,"“They could have left themselves the room,” Mr. Lavine said. “Now you’ve already set the cap low enough that you may not be able to do what you want to do six months from now.”

The spending cap is more complicated and less comprehensive than its simple name suggests. According to the Texas Constitution, spending from state tax revenue that is not mandated by the Constitution cannot “exceed the estimated rate of growth of the state’s economy.” Federal spending, which makes up more than a third of the budget, is not subject to the cap. Neither are big pots of revenue like the state gas tax. In all likelihood, less than half of the budget lawmakers approve next year will fall under the cap.

Yet the part of the budget that is subject to the cap generally overlaps the portion over which lawmakers have the most discretion, and includes most state spending on public schools. A majority of the House and Senate can allow budget writers to spend beyond the cap, but Republican lawmakers in particular are loath to support such a vote. Democrats have warned that a lower cap could make it difficult for the Legislature to tackle high-profile shortfalls in some areas, including transportation and education.

“Those are all big-ticket items, and the question will be whether we will have sufficient dollars to meet the state’s priorities under the spending cap we have set,” said Representative Sylvester Turner, Democrat of Houston.

Mr. Turner, one of two Democrats on the 10-member Budget Board, said the board should have approved a higher spending cap, though he voted with the board’s majority because the outcome was inevitable.

“This was not the time for a person like me to wage my battle,” Mr. Turner said. “If I choose to engage in a battle, I want to engage in a battle that realistically I think I can win.”

The fact that the state spending cap is a political issue is unusual. Over the past 20 years, the cap has served as little more than a historical footnote, set high enough that budget writers have rarely found themselves in danger of reaching it. That changed in 2013, when state coffers were unexpectedly flush with revenue after the Legislature had cut billions from the budget two years earlier. Busting the spending cap became a concern for lawmakers negotiating the budget writing process. At one point, Gov. Rick Perry left House Republicans baffled by urging them to bust the cap after previously advocating for making the cap more restrictive. Lawmakers eventually passed a $200 billion budget without busting the cap.

A similar focus on the spending cap could unfold during next year’s session, as a strong Texas economy is expected to once again keep state coffers full.

“We’ve had sort of a perfect storm of an incredibly deep recession with an incredibly robust recovery,” Mr. Craymer said.

Many conservative lawmakers and groups are hopeful that the spending cap will become more restrictive. They have called for amending the Constitution to peg the cap to the combined rates in inflation and population growth rather than the current approach, which uses the growth in average state personal income as a proxy for the overall growth in the state economy.

“Texans deserve a conservative budget,” wrote Christopher Paxton, a fiscal analyst for Empower Texans, a conservative group. “Our state cannot have a conservative budget if it does not have realistic limits that adequately protect taxpayers from budget-busting politicians.”

Critics of the population-and-inflation approach have noted that the most common gauge of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, does not factor in the costs of many of the items governments tend to spend the most on, such as highway building materials.

Mr. Heflin said the Consumer Price Index was an appropriate metric to use because it is one most voters could comprehend.

“We want it to be as understandable and as transparent as possible, and that’s one of the reasons we stay with C.P.I.,” Mr. Heflin said. “I know the argument can be made that that is not the best indicator.”

The focus on state population growth could also be misleading, said Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities.

“What population are we talking about?” she said. “The school-age population? The 65-and-over population? The inmate population? There’s growth in some populations that affect the budget more than others.”

Both Mr. Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst have previously called for tightening the state’s spending cap. Their successors, Gov.-elect Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov.-elect Dan Patrick, have similar positions.

The strong showing by Republicans during this year’s elections suggests that tightening the spending cap could gain traction, Mr. Heflin said. Along with changing the way the cap is calculated, there is a growing interest in broadening the cap so it affects more of the budget.

“We think to have a true cap on growth, it would need to apply to all funds, or at a minimum, all state funds,” Mr. Heflin said. “I think there is a good chance we will see some movement in that area this session.”",Lower Economic Growth Forecast in Texas May Keep Billions From State Budget,2014-12-05,An obscure committee of state lawmakers met at the Texas Capitol this week to approve an arcane measure with big consequences.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/us/politics/lower-economic-growth-forecast-may-keep-billions-from-budget.html

GOLETA, Calif. — An oil spill from a ruptured onshore pipeline that fouled beaches and threatened wildlife along a scenic stretch of the California coast spread across 9 miles of ocean Wednesday and officials said up to 105,000 gallons may have leaked out.

Up to a fifth of that amount — 21,000 gallons — reached the sea, according to estimates.

Federal regulators were investigating the leak as workers in protective suits raked and shoveled stinky black goo off the beaches, and boats towed booms into place to corral the two slicks off the Santa Barbara coast. More than 6,000 gallons had been collected by cleanup crews.

The coastline was the scene of a much larger spill in 1969 — the largest in U.S. waters at the time — that is credited with giving rise to the American environmental movement.

The chief executive of the company that runs the pipeline, Plains All American Pipeline LP, was at the site of the spill Wednesday and apologized for it.

""We deeply, deeply regret that this incident has occured at all,"" Chairman and CEO Greg L. Armstrong said at a news conference. ""We apologize for the damage that it's done to the wildlife and to the environment and we're very sorry for the disruption and inconvenience that it's caused on the citizens and the visitors to this area.""

Armstrong said the company had received permission to continue cleanup operations around the clock and vowed that they ""will remain here until everything has been restored to normal.""

Crude was flowing through the pipe at 54,600 gallons an hour at the time of the leak Tuesday, the company said. Company officials didn't say how long it leaked before it was discovered and shut down, or discuss the rate at which oil escaped.

Federal regulators from the Department of Transportation, which oversees oil pipeline safety, investigated the leak's cause, the pipe's condition and the potential regulatory violations.

The 24-inch pipe built in 1991 had no previous problems and was thoroughly inspected in 2012, according to Plains. The pipe underwent similar tests about two weeks ago, though the results had not been analyzed yet.

There was no estimate on the cost of the cleanup or how long it might take.

A combination of soiled beaches and pungent stench of petroleum caused state parks officials to close Refugio State Beach and El Capitan State Beach, both popular campgrounds west of Santa Barbara, over the Memorial Day weekend.

Still, tourists were drawn to pull off the Pacific Coast Highway to eye the disaster from overlooking bluffs.

""It smells like what they use to pave the roads,"" said Fan Yang, of Indianapolis, who was hoping to find cleaner beaches in Santa Barbara, about 20 miles away. ""I'm sad for the birds — if they lose their habitat.""

The early toll on wildlife included two oil-covered pelicans, said spokeswoman Melinda Greene. Biologists were seen counting dead fish and crustaceans along sandy beaches and rocky shores.

The state Department of Fish and Wildlife closed fishing and shellfish harvesting for a mile east and west of Refugio beach and it deployed booms to protect the nesting and foraging habitat of the snowy plover and the least tern, both endangered shore birds.

The coastal area is habitat for seals, sea lions and whales, which are now migrating north through the area.

Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday night declared a state of emergency because of the spill, a move that frees up additional state funding and resources to help in the cleanup.

Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley said her office, along with the state attorney general, is investigating the pipeline spill for possible criminal prosecution or a finding of civil liability.

Environmental groups used the spill as an opportunity to take a shot at fossil fuels and remind people of the area's notoriety with oil spills.

""Big Oil comes with big risks — from drilling to delivery,"" said Bob Deans, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Santa Barbara learned that lesson over 40 years ago when offshore drilling led to disaster.""

Large offshore rigs still dot the horizon off the coast, pumping crude to shore and small amounts of tar from natural seepage regularly show up on beaches. The leak occurred in a pipe that was carrying crude from an onshore facility toward refineries further down the chain of production.

The oil spilled into a culvert running under a highway and into a storm drain that emptied into the ocean.

The spill was not expected to affect gas prices, even though the pipeline was out of operation for now, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy at the Oil Price Information Service.

In fact, Californians probably will see high prices drop a bit because the wholesale price of gas has dropped 60 cents a gallon in the past week, Kloza said.","Oil Slicks Spread 9 Miles Off California, Foul Beaches, Air",2015-05-20,A broken onshore pipeline spewed oil down a storm drain and into the Pacific Ocean for several hours before it was shut off.,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/05/20/us/ap-us-california-oil-spill.html
89,"FRANKFURT — Siemens, the German industrial giant, said on Thursday that it would cut 4,500 jobs as it reacts to a slump in oil prices that has eroded its sales of equipment to the energy industry.

Lower oil prices have generally been a boon to the eurozone economy, freeing up cash that consumers can spend on other things. But in the case of Siemens, the effect is the opposite because of its large business supplying producers of oil, gas and electricity.

Siemens said it needed to cut jobs and reduce costs because of “the persistently difficult environment in the global power generation market,” which the company said included “regulatory changes, massive price erosion, aggressive competitors and regional overcapacities.”

The job cuts bring the total number of layoffs this year to almost 12,000 out of a global work force of about 340,000, or a reduction of about 3.5 percent. Roughly half of the latest round of cuts will be in Germany, where about one-third of all Siemens employees are based.

Objections from labor representatives, who by law have half the seats on the supervisory board, prompted the company to cut about 400 fewer jobs over all in Germany than had previously been planned.

Siemens, based in Munich, also said that net profit in the first three months of the year more than doubled, to 3.9 billion euros, or about $4.4 billion. But the increase came from selling assets, including a maker of hearing aids and a stake in a household appliance manufacturer.

Profit from Siemens’s industrial businesses, not including one-time gains from asset sales, fell 5 percent to €1.7 billion.

Sales from January to March, Siemens’s fiscal second quarter, rose 8 percent to €18 billion. But all of the gain was because of the weaker euro, which increased the value of revenue collected in dollars when converted into euros. New orders, an indicator of future sales, rose 16 percent to €20.8 billion, but more than half the increase was because of the favorable exchange rate, Siemens said.

Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, is in the midst of a reorganization intended to focus the company on its most profitable businesses. Siemens makes wind turbines, trains and streetcars, and X-ray scanners, among other products. Energy-related businesses, including equipment like gas turbines used to generate electricity, account for about a third of the company’s sales.

Turmoil in the energy industry has raised questions about the wisdom of Siemens’s planned acquisition of Dresser-Rand, a supplier of equipment to the oil and gas industries, based in Houston. The $7.6 billion deal, which the companies have said they want to complete by summer, is under review by European Union antitrust officials.

Oil prices have regained ground since hitting lows in February, but the increase may not be big enough to restore the company’s profits. In addition, Siemens is focused on large customers such as power utilities at a time when power generation is becoming more decentralized because of the spread of solar and wind power.

Siemens has struggled to grab a share of the wind power industry. Its wind power and renewables unit reported a quarterly loss of €44 million on sales of €1.4 billion.

The job cuts at Siemens are unlikely to have a broad economic effect in Germany, which has an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent, the lowest in the eurozone. But the company’s decision to concentrate the most recent cuts in Germany could be a sign that the country is becoming a less attractive place for companies to invest.

Germany’s low unemployment rate has emboldened unions to seek higher wages after years of increases that barely kept pace with inflation. While bigger pay increases may be justified, they can encourage companies to invest in places where unions have less power.

157,"A slump in energy prices helped push the stock market back from nominal records on Tuesday.

Energy stocks slid as the price of oil resumed its descent. Traders speculated that member nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would fail to agree on production cuts at their meeting in Vienna on Thursday. Oil has now dropped almost a third from a peak in June.

While lower oil prices are a long-term boon to consumers and industrial companies, they are a drag on stocks in the near term because energy companies account for about 10 percent of the overall stock market’s profits.

Despite the losses, the major indexes remain close to benchmark highs.

Stocks have been drifting gradually higher this month, having rebounded sharply from a slump in October, as investors have grown more confident that actions from central banks around the world will help bolster the global economy. The gains are likely to continue for now, said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust.

“People’s sentiment is still pretty conservative,” he said. “That means that the slow-and-steady market can continue longer than people anticipate.”

Among individual stocks, Pall, a company that makes filters for the food and health care industries, was the leading gainer in the S.&P. 500. The company’s stock jumped $3.31, or 3.5 percent, to $98 after its earnings beat the expectations of analysts.

Energy stocks slid along with oil prices after reports that the world’s biggest producers were unlikely to cut production to help stop a slump in the price of crude.

Crude oil for January delivery fell $1.69 to close at $74.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $1.35 to close at $78.33 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London.

In the bond market, interest rates declined.

233,"The money so assiduously carried to Iraq from a vast facility in New Jersey operated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York came from the Development Fund of Iraq, which was created by a United Nations resolution in May 2003 to hold Iraqi oil revenue. The fund was to be used in Iraq’s reconstruction, and the United Nations resolution called for the creation of a monitoring board to make sure the United States-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which governed Iraq in 2003 and the first half of 2004 and ordered the cash flights, used the money properly for the benefit of the Iraqi people.

For the C.P.A., an advantage of using the cash from the Development Fund instead of money appropriated by Congress for Iraq was that there were not a lot of rules governing its use, and no federal regulations or congressional oversight of what happened to it. It was Iraqi money, not anything from American taxpayers.

In an interview, Paul Bremer, who was the head of the C.P.A., defended the agency’s handling of the funds, and said the money was badly needed to keep Iraqi government ministries in operation. In particular, he defended the decision to accelerate the cash flights in June 2004, just before the provisional authority closed and was replaced by an interim Iraqi government. In the last two weeks of June, the C.P.A. ordered $4 billion to $5 billion in cash to be flown to Baghdad from New York in a rapid-fire series of last-minute flights.

The Iraqi government “was broke at that point,” Mr. Bremer said. “Civil servants had not been paid for about three months. We had to get funds there right away.” He said that there was a budget process in Baghdad that determined how much cash was requested from the Federal Reserve.

“The issue is what happened to the money once it was distributed through the minister of finance,” he said. “We had a very clear record of funds going to the Iraqi system.”

Mr. Bowen was dismissive of Mr. Bremer’s defense of the C.P.A. Accounting for the funds was so lax, he said, that there were few credible records of how it was spent. “Our auditors interviewed numerous senior advisers of the C.P.A., and we learned from them that the controls on the Development Fund of Iraq money were inadequate,” Mr. Bowen said. “We didn’t make this up; we learned this from C.P.A. staff.”

Former Treasury Department officials also questioned the need for the flights. Treasury had already sent $1.7 billion in cash from Iraqi government accounts in the United States to Baghdad in the first weeks after the invasion, and then had developed a new Iraqi currency that was introduced that October. They say the new currency ended the need for further cash infusions from the United States.

“We did not know that Bremer was flying in all that cash,” said Ged Smith, who was the head of the Treasury Department team that worked on Iraq’s financial reconstruction after the invasion. “I can’t see a reason for it.”

Mr. Bowen said that Brick Tracker, his office’s most sensitive investigation, began in 2010 when Wael el-Zein, a Lebanese- American on his staff, received a tip about stolen money hidden in Lebanon. An informant told him about the bunker, which in addition to the cash, was believed to also have held approximately $200 million in gold belonging to the Iraqi government.

But by this time, official Washington had long since forgotten about the flights from Andrews. The C.I.A. expressed little interest in pursuing the matter, and the F.B.I. said it lacked jurisdiction, Mr. Bowen recalled. And when Mr. Bowen and his staff tried to conduct an investigation of the missing cash in Lebanon, they also met with resistance from the United States Embassy in Beirut.

Mr. Bowen was not allowed to travel to Lebanon on official business. Two of his investigators who did travel to Lebanon were denied permission from the embassy to see the bunker themselves because it was too dangerous. When Mr. Bowen’s staff members met in Beirut with Lebanon’s prosecutor general, Said Mirza, he initially agreed to cooperate on an investigation, but later decided against it.

The office of the special inspector general for Iraq closed in 2013, and Mr. Bowen is now working in the private sector. Mr. Bowen thinks at least some of the money has been moved, and said it is impossible to say whether any of it is still in the bunker. He says he is still frustrated by the lack of cooperation he got from his own government in his efforts to pursue the missing cash. “We struggled to gain timely support from the interagency as we pursued this case,” Mr. Bowen said.",Investigation Into Missing Iraqi Cash Ended in Lebanon Bunker ,2014-10-12,"Between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion in Iraqi funds were stolen after the American invasion and moved to rural Lebanon, a former United States investigator said for the first time, but the trail ended there.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/world/investigation-into-missing-iraqi-cash-ended-in-lebanon-bunker.html

HOUSTON — Halliburton announced on Tuesday plans to lay off about 7 percent of its work force, or 5,200 to 6,400 workers, in response to plummeting oil prices.

Halliburton and other service companies that drill and complete wells onshore and offshore are typically the first and worst hit when producers decommission rigs and cut investments in exploration and production.

In recent weeks one oil company after another has announced 15 to 30 percent reductions in their 2015 budgets because of the 50 percent drop in crude prices since June. As many as 90 rigs a week are being dropped across American shale fields over the last couple of months in the most rapid deceleration of drilling in decades. Service fees have dropped by an average of 15 percent in recent months and are expected to go down further.

“We value every employee we have, but unfortunately we are faced with the difficult reality that reductions are necessary to work through this challenging market environment,” Halliburton said in a statement.

Halliburton had announced last month plans to cut 1,000 jobs, which are included in the new announcement. The company said the job cuts were not related to Halliburton’s recent acquisition of the Baker Hughes service company.

Industry executives are bracing for a prolonged period of low prices after several years of prices around $100 a barrel. The American West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark price fell by over 5 percent on Tuesday to just over $50.

Oil prices had been recovering since late January with traders anticipating that American oil production would quickly decline. But government and industry data indicate that domestic production is still growing and adding to a global glut, and it will continue to do so until the second half of the year at the earliest.

At the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, continues to refuse to cut production as it so often has in the past when prices dropped. Instead, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other OPEC producers have been slashing their prices on Asian markets to protect their market share.

Igor I. Sechin, the president of Russia’s state oil company and one of the country’s most senior energy officials, harshly criticized OPEC for having “lost its teeth” in a speech on Tuesday at International Petroleum Week in London.

Mr. Sechin said he saw no market reasons for the price collapse that was damaging his country’s economy, because war and geopolitical conflict are still rife in oil-producing regions around the world, thus prices should remain higher.

A series of research reports in recent days have predicted a prolonged bear market for the commodity. The International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris, on Tuesday projected an average oil price of $55 a barrel for 2015, increasing only gradually to $73 in 2020. “The market does not seem to be expecting prices to revisit earlier highs any time soon,” the report concluded.

The agency’s report suggested that the fall in prices would produce a “pause” in the swelling of American oil production in recent years mostly because of drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale fields in Texas and North Dakota. But the agency added that the price slump would “not bring it to an end,” predicting that producers would find ways to bring down costs and raise production again as prices recover.

Citi Research, in a report published on Monday, characterized the recent near 20 percent crude price recovery as “more like a head-fake than a sustainable turning point.” The Citi report projected that crude prices could still fall below $40 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate and potentially to as low as $20 before rebounding.",Halliburton to Trim Its Work Force by 7%,2015-02-11,The cuts come after a 50 percent drop in crude oil prices since June.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/business/halliburton-to-lay-off-7-of-its-work-force.html
237,"Is it just my imagination or is there a global oil war underway pitting the United States and Saudi Arabia on one side against Russia and Iran on the other? One can’t say for sure whether the American-Saudi oil alliance is deliberate or a coincidence of interests, but, if it is explicit, then clearly we’re trying to do to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, exactly what the Americans and Saudis did to the last leaders of the Soviet Union: pump them to death — bankrupt them by bringing down the price of oil to levels below what both Moscow and Tehran need to finance their budgets.

Think about this: four oil producers — Libya, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria — are in turmoil today, and Iran is hobbled by sanctions. Ten years ago, such news would have sent oil prices soaring. But today, the opposite is happening. Global crude oil prices have been falling for weeks, now resting around $88 — after a long stretch at $105 to $110 a barrel.

The price drop is the result of economic slowdowns in Europe and China, combined with the United States becoming one of the world’s biggest oil producers — thanks to new technologies enabling the extraction of large amounts of “tight oil” from shale — combined with America starting to make exceptions and allowing some of its newfound oil products to be exported, combined with Saudi Arabia refusing to cut back its production to keep prices higher, but choosing instead to maintain its market share against other OPEC producers. The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran, at a time when Saudi Arabia and America are confronting both of them in a proxy war in Syria. This is business, but it also has the feel of war by other means: oil.

The Russians have noticed. How could they not? They’ve seen this play before. The Russian newspaper Pravda published an article on April 3 with the headline, “Obama Wants Saudi Arabia to Destroy Russian Economy.” It said: “There is a precedent [for] such joint action that caused the collapse of the U.S.S.R. In 1985, the Kingdom dramatically increased oil production from 2 million to 10 million barrels per day, dropping the price from $32 to $10 per barrel. [The] U.S.S.R. began selling some batches at an even lower price, about $6 per barrel. Saudi Arabia [did not lose] anything, because when prices fell by 3.5 times [Saudi] production increased fivefold. The planned economy of the Soviet Union was not able to cope with falling export revenues, and this was one of the reasons for the collapse of the U.S.S.R.”

Indeed, the late Yegor Gaidar, who between 1991 and 1994 was Russia’s acting prime minister, observed in a Nov. 13, 2006, speech that: “The timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union can be traced to Sept. 13, 1985. On this date, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the minister of oil of Saudi Arabia, declared that the monarchy had decided to alter its oil policy radically. The Saudis stopped protecting oil prices. ... During the next six months, oil production in Saudi Arabia increased fourfold, while oil prices collapsed. ... The Soviet Union lost approximately $20 billion per year, money without which the country simply could not survive.”

Neither Moscow nor Tehran will collapse tomorrow. And if oil prices fall below $70 you will see a drop in U.S. production, as some exploration won’t be cost effective, and prices could firm up. But have no doubt, this price falloff serves U.S. and Saudi strategic interests and it harms Russia and Iran. Oil export revenues account for about 60 percent of Iran’s government revenues and more than half of Russia’s.

The price decline is no accident. In an Oct. 3 article in The Times, Stanley Reed noted that the sharp drop in oil prices “was seen as a response to Saudi Arabia’s signaling ... to the markets that it was more interested in maintaining market share than in defending prices. Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, stunned markets by announcing that it was cutting prices by about $1 a barrel to Asia, the crucial growth market for the Persian Gulf producers, as well as by 40 cents a barrel to the United States.” The Times also noted that with America now producing so much more oil and gas, “net oil imports to the United States have fallen since 2007 by 8.7 million barrels a day, ‘roughly equivalent to total Saudi and Nigerian exports,’ according to a recent Citigroup report.”

This resource abundance comes at a time when we’ve also hit a “gusher” of energy technology in Silicon Valley, which is supplying us with unprecedented gains in energy efficiency and productivity, savings that may become as impactful as shale in determining our energy security and global strength. Google, through Nest, and Apple through coding in the iPhone software, are making it easier for average Americans to manage and save energy at home or work.

Bottom line: The trend line for petro-dictators is not so good. America today has a growing advantage in what the former Assistant Energy Secretary Andy Karsner calls “the three big C’s: code, crude and capital.” If only we could do tax reform, and replace payroll and corporate taxes with a carbon tax, we’d have a formula for resiliency and success far better than any of our adversaries.",A Pump War?,2014-10-15,The decline in oil prices is no accident.

HOUSTON — For the better part of the last century, crude oil prices have swung like a pendulum, pushing and pulling the fortunes of nations. More often than not, global supplies of the volatile commodity were controlled by the rulers of desert domains who would otherwise have been powerless had it not been for the oil that bubbled beneath their thrones.

That pendulum is on the move again, sending the price of oil cascading to less than $45 this winter from more than $100 a barrel last June, and it may fall further in the months ahead. On the surface, this latest oil boom gone bust may feel like history repeating itself, but there is a vital difference this time: The center of the oil world has spun from the sands of Saudi Arabia to the shale oil fields of Texas and North Dakota, a giant new oil patch some wildcatters have begun to call “Cowboyistan.”

Put another way, the United States is overtaking the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as the vital global swing producer that determines prices. That remarkable change has been building since 2008, as American shale fields accounted for roughly half of the world’s oil production growth while American petroleum output nearly doubled. And shale production methods have proven highly adaptable to market conditions.

Not coincidentally, nearly all the advantages of the price swing are moving in Washington’s direction. Most American consumers and industries have benefited from a sharp drop in gasoline prices and other energy costs. And abroad, the economies of oil-producing adversaries like Russia and Venezuela are reeling.

Rene G. Ortiz, a former Ecuadorean oil minister who also once served as OPEC’s secretary general, noted that as recently as late 2008 and 2009, the last time oil prices slumped, OPEC cut oil production by four million barrels a day to support prices, and the move stabilized the market in a relatively short time.

Video

“Why doesn’t Saudi Arabia think that couldn’t work again today?” Mr. Ortiz asked. “Because of the soaring U.S. production. Today’s OPEC is thinking about market fundamentals rather than manipulating the market because it doesn’t have the same power it once had.”

Last Nov. 27 was a turning point for OPEC at its meeting in Vienna. It was a turbulent session, though behind closed doors, where the firebrand oil ministers of Venezuela and Iran faced off with the dour Saudis and their Persian Gulf allies. The Venezuelans and Iranians, backed by Algeria, Nigeria and a few other countries that need every cent they can get from their oil exports, argued that OPEC should slash production to strengthen prices exactly as the cartel did when the crude price tumbled during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, and again after the tech bubble popped in the early 2000s, and finally as it did again just six years ago.

But the Saudis and their Gulf allies said no. They argued that if they cut production, they would merely lose market share to the surging American producers who were increasing daily production by a million barrels year in and year out with no end in sight. The decision effectively forfeited the cartel’s traditional role as the global oil swing producer — the one and only supplier with the volume of production to raise and lower prices by managing the cartel’s output.

The decision came as a shock to the oil market. From the moment OPEC decided to keep its production constant at 30 million barrels a day, a fairly gradual price retreat that began in July morphed into a nose dive as commodity traders dumped their oil positions. Many independent American producers saw the move as a direct attack on them, but it was really a throwing in the towel to the new reality of growing American oil output.

The demise of OPEC as the price manipulator is what virtually every American president since Richard Nixon had in mind when they promised to find a way to make the United States energy independent, not chained to Middle East or OPEC oil, after the oil embargoes of the 1960s and 1970s.

Hydraulic fracturing, the blasting of oil and gas out of shale rock with water and chemicals, is the single most important factor of change in global markets in more than a decade, with an environmental outcry commensurate to its magnitude.

As soon as railroads connected North Dakota’s Bakken shale field to East Coast refineries the last couple of years, imports from the Middle East and Africa dried up, forcing various OPEC producers to redirect their product to China and other Asian markets. There, they battled it out for market share by slashing prices. That is just one example of how shale drilling not only transformed the United States from dependent consumer to a robust producer, but is also transforming the price dynamics of the global market.

Shale fields differ in several ways from conventional fields. Shale is not hard to find, but drilling is expensive because wells decline precipitously — by 60 to 70 percent in their first year. That means companies are obliged to drill well after well to keep production and revenue up.

Photo

That is not always good for individual producers, especially small ones, when prices fall. But those characteristics give shale producers collectively more power to influence the market because it condenses the amount of time companies have to respond to the inevitable cycles of boom and bust. Oil producers operating in the United States have the ability to rapidly accelerate or tap the brakes — much as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC partners have turned on and off their spare capacity in the past — depending on market conditions.

Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, noted that the United States, which produces roughly the same amount of oil as Saudi Arabia and is poised to surpass the kingdom, is positioned to become the new OPEC but without the overt manipulation.

“The only difference is our position as swing producer will be managed by the free market,” he said, noting that a few all-powerful sheikhs are being replaced by hundreds of executives serving competing companies deciding when, where and how to drill in the new shale fields.

“With the technological advantages we have, we have the ability to adjust to the market,” Mr. Gerard added.

The Saudis, in comparison, are in an increasingly weaker position. Last year, their exports declined not only to the United States, but to Asia as well. Still, as one of the lowest-price producers with an expanding refinery capacity, it remains an important player on the world stage.",New Balance of Power,2015-04-23,"Shale drilling has not only transformed the United States from dependent consumer into a robust producer of oil, it is also transforming the price dynamics of the global market.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/business/energy-environment/new-balance-of-power.html

RETAIL EARNINGS REPORTS IN A SUBDUED SEASON

Several national retailers will report quarterly earnings this week, including Home Depot, Lowe’s, Sears Holdings and Gap. Also reporting will be Target, which recently appointed a chief executive after a difficult year of troubled earnings and a huge breach of customer data. So far, retail earnings for the quarter have been fairly muted. Walmart, which is the nation’s largest retailer and often looked to for signs of consumer confidence and health because of its vast reach, said it found American customers continuing to behave cautiously with their dollars. That trepidation was on display in the company’s lackluster numbers.

SMALL INCREASE EXPECTED FOR CONSUMER PRICES

On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the latest data on the Consumer Price Index for July. Economists expect the overall index to show a very small rise of 0.1 percentage point for the month, thanks to moderating energy prices. The core C.P.I. reading, which strips out the more volatile food and energy categories, is expected to rise 0.2 percentage point, which is considered tame in terms of inflation.

ALASKANS TO VOTE ON CHANGING TAX STRUCTURE FOR OIL INDUSTRY

In a decision that could determine the future of Alaska’s all-important oil industry, Alaska voters on Tuesday will decide whether to repeal a new, lower tax structure for the industry as enacted by the State Legislature last year and return to a system of higher taxes originally pushed through the Legislature by former Gov. Sarah Palin. The vote is expected to be close. Alaska has long been a major oil producer, but its fields have been in decline in recent decades. Oil companies have financed the effort to support the new tax regime, arguing that lower taxes are the only way to encourage fresh investment, which otherwise would go to other oil prospects like those in Texas and North Dakota. Supporters of the referendum to repeal the tax change say the new code is a giveaway to the oil industry. The state government estimates it will collect $4.3 billion in oil tax revenue this year, down from $6.3 billion in 2013 under the old tax law. The new law eliminated tax increases when oil prices rose and cut the base tax rate. CLIFFORD KRAUSS

HOUSTON — Gasoline prices are drifting higher as Memorial Day weekend approaches, but American holiday travelers can still expect to save nearly a dollar a gallon compared with last year.

The sharp decline in oil and gas prices last fall and winter is saving the average household roughly $650 this year, according to the Energy Department, but the boon has lost some of its appeal in recent weeks. Retail gas costs are up by approximately a third since January, after an even larger rebound in crude oil prices at home and abroad.

Still, experts predict Americans will hit the road in large numbers to take advantage of fuel prices that remain lower than those of recent years.

The AAA motor club projects that 37.2 million Americans will travel more than 50 miles this weekend — a 4.7 percent increase from last year and the highest number for the holiday since 2005. Of those travelers, about 33 million will drive, a 5.3 percent increase over last year, the club said.

“A strong employment market and low gas prices have driven consumer optimism to new highs and boosted Americans’ disposable income,” said Marshall L. Doney, AAA’s president.

So far this year, however, retailers, restaurants and hotels have not enjoyed the increased consumer spending pegged to low energy prices that most economists had foretold.

Economists said they saw more benefits to the economy from lower fuel costs in the final quarter of 2014 than in the first three months of 2015 for reasons that are not yet clear.

“The bang from the lower gasoline prices did not come out as expected in the first quarter,” said Mine K. Yucel, senior vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

How much of a boost will come in the second quarter remains in doubt. Gasoline prices in most states have surged to their highest level since last November, when energy prices collapsed after an OPEC meeting in which Saudi Arabia and its allies decided against cutting production despite a growing global glut in crude oil supplies.

Surveys show that gas prices have risen over the last month in every region of the country. California and several other Western and Midwestern states experienced a notable increase because of various refinery outages. In Southern California, Exxon Mobil’s Torrance refinery has been producing well below capacity since a fire in February, though most repairs should be complete by the July 4 weekend.

Other breakdowns and maintenance problems in other refineries in California, Illinois and Louisiana have affected several local markets.

Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, said most of the refinery problems would have a temporary price impact, except in California, where he said gasoline prices over the summer months should remain high relative to the rest of the country.

“There is so much incentive to make a lot of gasoline,” Mr. Kloza said. “It is going to be a cheap summer under all circumstances, except for the possibility of a hurricane landfall on the Gulf Coast.”

Oil prices have been wavering in recent days because of the fluctuating value of the American dollar and other forces that are taking oil futures up and down.

The recent Islamic State capture of Ramadi, Iraq, and rising tensions in Yemen — which threaten open conflict between Saudi Arabia and Yemen — have increased the sense among oil traders that turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa could halt critical supplies of crude from reaching global markets.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Those fears have been partly eased, however, by rising production in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and even Russia, despite Western sanctions.

The average national price for a gallon of regular gas on Friday was $2.74, 4 cents more than a week ago and 26 cents more than a month ago, but still 91 cents below the price a year ago. The Energy Department recently projected that the national price for a gallon of regular would peak this month and average $2.55 this summer.

All told, oil prices have surged by roughly 40 percent since late March on the expectation that a falloff in production and a recovering economy in Europe and Asia would eventually diminish global oil supplies — which remain between 1.5 million and two million barrels in excess of demand.

And with crude oil inventories abundant — nearly 90 million barrels more than last year in the United States alone — many energy analysts warn that a backlog of uncompleted wells could mean that producers may increase production in the near future and drive prices back down again.

Some energy experts predict that once refinery activity eases after the summer driving season, domestic petroleum inventories could rise to levels not seen since the Depression years of the 1930s.

“Crude and gasoline prices are going to fall between now and the end of the year,” Mr. Kloza predicts, adding that by late December “there will be many more states with $1.99 gasoline than $2.99 gasoline.”","Holiday Travelers at Highest Since 2005, Despite Rising Gas Prices",2015-05-23,"AAA predicts that 33 million Americans will hit the road this weekend, the highest number for the holiday since 2005, despite creeping fuel costs.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/business/energy-environment/memorial-day-travelers-unlikely-to-be-deterred-by-rising-gas-prices.html

A recovering economy and rapidly falling oil prices have provided some breathing room for airlines in recent months, bolstering profits and allowing carriers to buy new planes or upgrade their higher-end service.

But while motorists have seen gasoline prices fall at the pump, air travelers should not expect to see fares, or even fuel surcharges, drop anytime soon.

Airlines were quick to slap extra fuel charges on their international flights when oil prices spiked a few years ago. Today, those can reach about $500 for a round-trip international flight, for instance, between Newark and Frankfurt, or Los Angeles and Tokyo. But with oil prices down more than 40 percent since June, airlines have been a lot slower in cutting back those surcharges, particularly at a time when they have no trouble filling planes at current fares.

Fuel accounts for nearly half an airline’s costs. But airline executives are unsure where oil prices will settle or how sustained the downturn in the oil market will be. Alexandre de Juniac, the chairman of Air France-KLM, estimated that oil might hover between $70 and $80 a barrel next year, although he added, “Obviously, no one really knows.”

“It’s a reason that our fares probably won’t be increased,” he said. He noted that for European carriers, the drop in oil prices had been offset by the relative decline in the value of the euro against the dollar.

Oil futures for the American benchmark settled at $60.94 a barrel in New York on Wednesday, down 4.5 percent, their lowest level in more than five years. The drop has taken many experts by surprise. It was set off by sustained growth in domestic oil supplies in the United States along with a weak global economy.

This has translated into a windfall for the airlines.

The International Air Transport Association, an industry group based in Geneva, estimated that the industry’s profits would grow 26 percent next year, to reach a record $25 billion, not adjusted for inflation. The group expects $19.9 billion in collective profits in 2014. In 2013, the industry had nearly $11 billion in profits.

“There’s no doubt that the recent fall in the oil price is a relief for airlines,” Tony Tyler, the association’s director general, said on Wednesday.

The trade group, which represents most of the world’s airlines, said its 2015 forecast was based on an average price of $85 a barrel. That would be the lowest fuel price for the industry since 2010.

While consumers expect price drops to be reflected quickly in the price of gas at the pump, there is typically a lag with ticket prices. One reason is that airlines buy their fuel in advance, to hedge against higher costs. But if prices fall, this can effectively lock them into higher fixed prices for several months.

“If you’ve already bought and paid for your turkey for next Thanksgiving, and prices come down in the meantime, you won’t get any benefit from any subsequent reduction in turkey prices,” said John Strickland, an independent airline consultant in London. In addition, he said that airlines “also swallowed the pain of rapidly rising prices in the last year or so,” which have not been fully reflected in fares.

Another reason is that airlines have little incentive to reduce their fares now. Many flights are full, and carriers are reinvesting much of their profit in the business, paying dividends to shareholders or giving bonuses to employees.

Airlines insist that air travel remains a bargain, even at today’s prices, once adjusted for inflation. For instance, while consumer prices have increased 35 percent since 2000, airfares have risen 22 percent, including extra bag fees and other ancillary revenue, according to Airlines for America, a trade group. Operating expenses for the nine publicly traded American passenger carriers in the first nine months of the year rose 3.1 percent as declines in fuel costs were offset by higher costs elsewhere, the group said.

United States airlines paid $115 million less in fuel costs for the first nine months of 2014 compared with last year, a 0.3 percent reduction, the group said.

John Heimlich, the trade group’s chief economist, said airlines were reinvesting at the highest rate in 13 years. This includes improvements onboard the planes, enhanced airport facilities and amenities, and rewards to employees.

“It is critical to make the investments now and capitalize on the current environment,” he said.

Many of the improvements have been directed at the airlines’ most lucrative passengers, who are flying in business class or paying for full-fare coach seats. The majority of travelers who are seeking regular or cheaper tickets in coach are not seeing many of these benefits.

Delta Air Lines, for instance, announced on Monday a new lineup of its cabin classes. It renamed its business section Delta One, instead of BusinessFirst, and said it would have new quilted seat covers there. In the back of the plane, it introduced a class of fares called Basic Economy, the cheapest fares.

Passengers with those tickets, though, will not be able to book their seats in advance and will not be able to refund or change those tickets.

American Airlines announced this week that it would spend $2 billion to improve customer experience at the airport and inside its planes. Part of that investment includes adding more lie-flat seats for business class passengers and rolling out Wi-Fi satellite connections for its international flights.

“I don’t think they are going to pass the savings on to consumers as lower fares, but they might pass it on as better service or profit-sharing to their employees,” said George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, a website that provides information on fares and air travel deals. “Planes are full even at these higher fares. So I think the airlines are going to pass these savings as intangibles.”

Air France-KLM is spending more than $1.2 billion to refurbish planes, add services and modernize its airport lounges and ground services. Air France is getting new business-class seats on its planes.

“The rules of the game have changed,” Mr. de Juniac, the Air France-KLM chairman, said during a brief visit to New York, where Air France recently reopened its business-class lounge at Kennedy International Airport. The facility now includes a spa where passengers can receive a facial treatment, shower or a meal before boarding their trans-Atlantic flights to Paris.

In the meantime, the most economically fragile part of the population is already feeling some relief, which is likely to lead to extra spending on a variety of other goods and services.

Penny-pinching has been a way of life for Elaine Murszewski since she was laid off from her tech support job in 2009, but Ms. Murszewski, who is self-employed in the Denver suburb of Aurora, says lower gas prices are already making life a little easier.

“If my clients need me to go to their homes, I don’t have to worry about my gas tank being empty,” said Ms. Murszewski, who cobbles together about $900 a month helping two clients organize their offices and run online marketing campaigns.

With Americans spending roughly $1 billion a day on gasoline, Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, estimates that consumers will save roughly $8.4 billion in November and December, compared with the last two months of 2013, based on an average price for regular gasoline of about $2.89 a gallon as opposed to $3.23 last November and $3.26 last December.

The typical American household buys 1,200 gallons annually, so if prices fall to the level Mr. Kloza predicts and stay there, that adds up to a yearly savings per household of at least $400. A 15 percent drop in the cost of home heating oil since last winter should also be helpful, especially as cold weather arrives in the Northeast.

The extra cash in shoppers’ wallets and pocketbooks could help generate nearly half a percentage point in added economic growth in the fourth quarter, and roughly $70 billion more in consumer spending over the next year, according to Barclays.

At Mall of America, a sprawling complex with 500 stores, mini golf and an aquarium in Bloomington, Minn., the drop in gas prices came as welcome news. Almost half of the 40 million visitors a year are out-of-state tourists, and most of them drive to the mall, which is just south of Minneapolis, said Dan Jasper, a mall spokesman.

“If they can save some money on gas, it makes it much easier for families who might be on a budget to hop in that car and come up for the day,” Mr. Jasper said.

Crude oil prices have been falling since they peaked early in the summer, as demand slowed from China and weak European economies. The decline sharpened earlier this month when Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, cut the price of exports to the United States in a bid to retain market share.

At the pump, the drop in prices has been rapid, and most experts do not foresee a reversal of the trend anytime soon.

“We think lower gas prices in the U.S. are going to last for at least a year,” said Edward L. Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup. “Even if growth turns around globally, it would take two years of added demand around the world to move prices per barrel back to the mid-90s.”

On Wednesday, the federal Energy Information Administration cut its forecast for crude prices next year to $83 per barrel, $18 less than what the agency estimated last month, and predicted that the price of regular gasoline would stay below $3 gallon through all of 2015.

While consumers are the biggest beneficiaries, lower energy prices are also a boon to small-business owners like Barry Grossenburg.

The owner of Grossenburg Implement, a farm equipment business, Mr. Grossenburg sends his small fleet of trucks hundreds of miles from his main location in the small town of Winner, S.D., every day during the fall harvest season. Grossenburg Implement consumes roughly 250,000 gallons of diesel and gasoline a year, he said, so the savings at the pump could lift the company’s annual profit by $100,000.

Farmers who spend hours on the road this time of year hauling crops to market, he added, are also pleased with the drop in prices. “The fuel thing is going to help the whole economy,” Mr. Grossenburg said.

The automobile industry looks to be among corporate America’s biggest beneficiaries. Sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles jumped 9.1 percent last month from October 2013, according to the Autodata Corporation, as consumers flocked to more expensive, less fuel-efficient models that generate bigger profits for automakers. Passenger car sales registered a 2.8 percent increase.

But while some experts fear that efforts to conserve energy will falter if gasoline prices stay low, automakers say they will be more careful this time about ramping up production of S.U.V.s in response to cheaper gas, to avoid being left with bloated inventories when prices eventually rebound.

Lower crude prices are also unlikely to have a big effect on alternative energy in power markets, experts say, because oil does not generally compete as a source of electricity with renewables like wind and solar.

Meanwhile, businesses across the country are hoping oil prices stay down for a while.

“If this goes into the spring, that will be very helpful,” said Todd J. Teske, chief executive of Briggs & Stratton, a century-old Milwaukee manufacturer that is the world’s largest producer of gasoline engines for outdoor equipment like lawn mowers and snowblowers. “When the consumer has a few more dollars in their pocket, they’re apt to usually spend the money.”",Sliding Oil and Gas Prices Give Americans More Money to Spend,2014-11-14,The effect of cheaper crude oil and gasoline is especially significant for those Americans largely left behind by an anemic economic recovery.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/business/economy/lower-oil-prices-give-a-lift-to-the-american-economy.html
243,"Now, with political tensions high in North Africa and the Middle East, Kuwait, Oman and Abu Dhabi have all begun to reduce subsidies on power, diesel and natural gas in recent months. Kuwait has been notably aggressive because of a fiscal squeeze, and it has plans to triple the price of kerosene and diesel early this year. (Subsidies on gasoline and electricity, though, will remain untouched for now.)

At the same time, Egypt, which began cutting energy subsidies last spring even before oil prices began their 50 percent decline, is quickening the pace of its energy reform.

For countries like India, Egypt and Indonesia, which import sizable amounts of oil, governments hope not only to save money on subsidies but also to curb energy use to improve their balances of trade. For producing countries like Oman and Kuwait, lower subsidies save their governments money when they are earning much less from their exports. For both producer and consumer countries, government funds that finance subsidies could instead go to social programs and other investments.

“We know from studies in Mexico, Africa and Asia that these subsidies do not end up in the hands of the poorest people,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the University of California, Davis. “They put a strain on federal budgets that are needed to help the poor, and they end up helping the wealthiest and middle class in these societies more.”

Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, United Arab Emirates minister of state and chairman of Masdar, a company specializing in clean-energy technology, told officials at a regional energy conference in January that money saved from reduced subsidies is “money that can otherwise be redirected to improve energy systems and transform economies by creating jobs, stimulating economic growth and educating future generations.”

The United States, like most developed countries, does not subsidize the consumption of energy or put price controls on fossil fuels, although environmentalists point out that oil companies receive tax breaks for exploration. A debate has begun about whether to raise gasoline taxes now to repair roads and bridges, as well as to damp demand for cheap fuel.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

With oil prices halved, cutting subsidies is half as expensive for the governments at a time when they are under financial stress. Saudi Arabia, for example, now consumes about a quarter of its production of oil domestically compared with only 3 percent in the 1970s, because of a growing and more prosperous population and dependence on burning oil for electrical power. At the same time, subsidized consumption has meant lower revenues for national oil companies across the region, impeding exploration and technological advancement.

Rising consumption of oil in the Middle East and in the developing world has tightened global supplies by several million barrels a day, energy experts say, helping to raise crude prices over the last decade.

For years, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been urging Middle East producers and developing countries alike to cut subsidies. In a report in October, the I.M.F. reported that subsidies distort prices and foster overconsumption.

“Overconsumption leads to adverse impacts on traffic congestion, health, and the environment,” the I.M.F. paper said. “Subsidies also discourage investment in the energy sector, and encourage smuggling and black market activity, which can lead to shortages of subsidized products.”

Since 2011, there has been slow reform in the Middle East and Africa, with Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Mauritania, Tunisia and Yemen raising some energy prices. But turbulence in the region has slowed change. Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela — three of the most heavily subsidized countries — have done little or nothing to reform.

That is because cutting subsidies often leads to a political backlash, energy experts say, and they have already emboldened the opposition in Kuwait. Cuts in energy subsidies helped produce serious political turbulence in Venezuela in 1993 and Indonesia in 1998, and more recently in Nigeria, Jordan and Ecuador.

At an energy conference in Abu Dhabi in December, Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, urged regional oil ministers to seize the moment of low energy prices to reduce subsidies.

“There is no time for action like the present,” she was quoted as saying by the Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications, which is based in Cyprus. “It’s an opportunity to put a price on carbon and slash fossil fuel subsidies.”",Low Energy Prices Offer Opening for Subsidy Cuts,2015-02-04,"Middle Eastern and developing countries have long kept oil cheap for political reasons, but a new global energy picture presents an opportunity to stop.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/business/low-energy-prices-offer-opening-for-subsidy-cuts.html

Just over two years ago, one of the nation’s airline trade organizations called the industry “hypercompetitive” and declared “airfare remains a bargain.” At the time, the Justice Department was weighing the competitive implications of a merger between American Airlines and US Airways, around two years after the merger of United and Continental.

Fast-forward to the present.

Far from “hypercompetitive,” the airline industry is increasingly looking like an uncompetitive oligopoly.

For proof, look no further than airline ticket prices.

Over the last year, oil prices have dropped by more than 50 percent. Motorists filling up at their local gas stations know that prices at the pump have dropped precipitously.

But consumers who have logged on to Expedia or Priceline or Kayak recently to book tickets saw that airfares had not dropped along with oil prices, an airline’s largest expense.

Why?

The answer is that mergers over the last several years have left the nation with only four main airlines — Delta, United, Southwest and American-US Airways — which deliberately don’t compete on some routes.

For shareholders, the industry is finally paying off as an investment after years of losses. But for customers, not so much.

Airline executives insist that the industry is as competitive as ever and that they are just more “disciplined” about pricing and investing in routes. The airlines like to say that they haven’t lowered prices because there is so much demand and so little capacity, an industry term that means available seats. They also point to hedging contracts for oil that they entered into last year, which locked some of them into paying higher prices for fuel. And they say they are investing heavily: American Airlines, for example, is investing $2 billion in its fleet. Delta, too, is upgrading many of its planes.

All of that is true to some degree.

But in a truly competitive marketplace, airlines would add capacity to popular routes where they saw the opportunity to undercut a competitor. And given low oil prices, you would imagine that at least one airline would lower its rates to pick up market share and make it up in volume.

American Airlines, for example, doesn’t hedge its fuel costs, so it would arguably be well positioned to pick up business from its rivals. But it hasn’t tried.

“The idea that U.S. airlines would, once again, devolve into a war for market share is founded on a misunderstanding of the new structure of U.S. airlines,” Vinay Bhaskara, an industry analyst, wrote in Airways News. “We are unquestionably living with an air travel oligopoly.”

He added: “Remember, this is the same management group that (instead of allowing passengers to reap a modest reduction in fares) responded to the F.A.A.’s inability to collect taxes in mid-2011 by gleefully raising base fares to where total out-of-pocket costs were exactly the same (earning a windfall of $28.5 million per day).”

Such behavior is only possible either in an industry with very little competition or one in which members seem to actively avoid it. The cost of air travel has drawn the scrutiny of Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. “At a time when the cost of fuel is plummeting and profits are rising, it is curious and confounding that ticket prices are sky-high and defying economic gravity,” he declared in a statement in December. “The industry often raises prices in a flash when oil prices spike, yet they appear not to be adjusting for the historic decline in the cost of fuel; ticket prices should not shoot up like a rocket and come down like a feather.”

He urged the Justice Department and the Transportation Department to investigate immediately why airline profits are not being passed down to consumers more efficiently. So far, his call for an investigation seems to have gone unheeded. The Justice Department sent a letter to Senator Schumer contending that the merger of American Airlines and US Airways — which it approved contingent upon some divestitures — has led to benefits for consumers through “lower prices and increased service.”

That’s an odd statement because the Justice Department originally sought to block the deal based on evidence that the industry was already seeking to avoid competition. “If, for example, United offers nonstop service on a route, and Delta and American offer connecting service on that same route, Delta and American typically charge the same price for their connecting service as United charges for its nonstop service,” the government found. “As American executives observed, the legacy airlines ‘generally respect the pricing of the nonstop carrier [on a given route],’ even though it means offering connecting service at the same price as nonstop service.”

Senator Schumer, responding to the lack of action in Washington, said in a statement, “The fact that airfares are still at 30,000 feet and climbing, despite the stable gas prices and rising airline industry profits, is extremely troubling, and the federal government has more work to do.”

According to the International Air Transport Association, the industry in the United States is set to post “net post-tax profits” of $13.2 billion in 2015, up from $11.9 billion in 2014. That forecast, however, was based on an average cost of $85 a barrel for Brent crude oil. Today, the price is about $55 a barrel.

American Airlines predicts a pretax profit margin of 12 to 14 percent for the first quarter, and Delta forecasts an operating profit margin of 11 to 13 percent.

There is some hope for a drop in ticket prices this year. The transport association forecast prices will fall about 5 percent globally, though that is still woefully short of the drop in fuel prices.

No one wants to return to the damaging days of an unprofitable airline industry, but those days were largely the result of a free market run amok. Now we might have an oligopoly run amok. With little incentive for new entrants and entrenched players owning most of the main routes, it is hard to argue that much competition exists.

On the few competitive routes that the airlines pursue for market share reasons or to serve their hub-and-spoke model — New York to Los Angeles, for example — prices have remained relatively constrained. Meanwhile, in the front of the planes on those routes, the top airlines have been racing to offer the best lie-flat beds. They advertise full pages in entertainment trade publications like The Hollywood Reporter.

Now that’s a competitive spirit. Too bad it is unlikely to spread to the rest of the country.","As Oil Prices Fall, Airfares Still Stay High",2015-03-24,"Far from &#8220;hypercompetitive,&#8221; the airline industry nowadays is increasingly looking like an uncompetitive oligopoly.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/business/dealbook/as-oil-prices-fall-air-fares-still-stay-high.html
246,"Creating Value Are you getting the most out of your business?

In my most recent post I wrote about an electrical distributorship that was for sale. The investment banker on the sale, Kevin Short from Clayton Capital Partners, thought the business would probably bring a multiple of four to five times Ebitda.

As part of the sale process, Mr. Short helped his client understand that the value of his company was likely to be $16 million to $20 million. At the same time, however, Mr. Short decided he would pursue what he calls “the outrageous sales strategy” to see if he could sell the company for an even higher number.

Remember, this business distributes parts to electrical contractors. It’s not a sexy business, and you wouldn’t think it could be sold for an outrageous amount of money.

But any company can bring a competitive strategy to the table. A seller needs to think about a business from the buyer’s point of view. I’ve written about a heating, ventilating and air-conditioning company that had a competitive advantage in the way it served clients. I’ve also written about a trucking company with contracts in the oil industry. Both companies held a competitive advantage that a buyer of the business should be willing to pay a premium for.

The competitive advantage the electrical distributor had was the market domination it held over its region. Competitors from outside the area had tried to make inroads into the market, but those efforts had failed. The only way competitors thought they could gain a reasonable amount of market share was by buying the company Mr. Short was trying to sell.

Step 1: Start with a big funnel.

Clayton Capital started the sales process by throwing a wide net. It sent out letters of inquiry to 4,000 private equity groups and 400 buyers. Of those contacted, 110 signed nondisclosure agreements so they could take a look at the details of the offer. From the 110 that showed interest, 50 had conversations with Clayton Capital. Of those 50, 15 were allowed to have conversations with the seller’s management. Ten companies submitted offers.

Step 2: The controlled-auction process.

When you identify 10 companies that are interested in buying and qualified to buy a business, a competent investment banker will enter into what is called a controlled auction process.

This process brought three offers that were significantly higher than what Mr. Short had prepared his buyer to accept. At that point, price was no longer the issue; now it was about negotiating the terms of the sale. In this case, all three finalists were already producing more than a billion dollars in annual sales, which meant all three could afford the company. And all three thought they needed the company for strategic purposes.

The seller wanted to make sure that employees would be treated well after the transaction. Because the three offers were similar, the selling company could focus on that one issue.

Step 3: The balance of power shifts.

The company and Mr. Short went through the process of vetting the three finalists. Eventually, they made a choice. This is where the balance of power in the deal switches from the seller to the buyer: A letter of intent is signed and the selling company agrees to stop talking with other potential buyers.

This is also when due diligence starts and the details are worked out in a purchase and sales agreement. Things can still go awry; buyers can get cold feet or feel insulted by the process of due diligence. In this case, the sticking points were some changes the buyer wanted to make in employment agreements.

In many deals when this happens, the seller shrugs and moves on. But not in this case. This seller was ready to scrap the deal if necessary to protect the employees, and that is why this is where investment bankers really earn their money. Mr. Short had to get between the buyer and seller and persuade the buyer that the changes it wanted were not going to fly. Ultimately, the buyer backed down.

The buyer was a company with an employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, that offered to pay about $43 million, almost 11 times Ebitda, for the business. (In my next post I’ll talk about why ESOPs are great for acquiring other companies. Hint: It’s about taxes.)

The buyer agreed to vest all of the seller’s employees immediately in the ESOP and to allocate 15 percent of the employees’ pay to their ESOP retirement accounts every year. This allowed all of the existing employees to benefit from the sale and encouraged them to stay with the new company. And that sealed the deal.

247,"In all, 55 percent of hybrid and electric vehicle owners are defecting to a gasoline-only model at trade-in time — the lowest level of hybrid loyalty since Edmunds.com began tracking such transactions in 2011. More than one in five are switching to a conventional sport utility vehicle, nearly double the rate of three years ago.

That one-and-done syndrome coincides with tumbling sales of electric and hybrid vehicles. Through April, sales of electrified models slid to 2.7 percent of the market, down from 3.4 percent over the same period last year, Edmunds.com said. At the same time, sport utility vehicles grabbed 34.4 percent of sales, up from 31.6 percent.

There is little mystery behind the shift in sentiment. To the delight of every fast-pumping American, a gallon of regular gasoline has fallen to $2.66 on average, from nearly $4 in 2012, according to the Oil Price Information Service. The federal Energy Department figures that the average household will save $750 on fuel bills this year. Those flush households can afford to expand their car-shopping horizons, with less anxiety over a model’s thirst for fuel.

At that $4-per-gallon high in 2012, a Toyota Camry Hybrid buyer driving 15,000 miles a year could save enough in fuel to break even in five years on the $3,800 price premium versus a conventional Camry. Today, that owner would have to keep the Camry Hybrid for nine years, nearly twice as long as before, to pay back its higher price.

Before hybrid fans accuse their brethren of automotive treason, the former hybrid owners are not exactly trading Toyota Priuses for Cadillac Escalades.

The universe of sport utility vehicles — once rife with gas-guzzling land yachts — has expanded to include wildly popular compact and even subcompact models whose fuel economy has jumped by up to a third in less than a decade. Even the biggest S.U.V.s, pickups and sedans have toned down their thirst, giving buyers better reasons — or a handy excuse — to choose a larger, more capable vehicle.

“When you can get a midsize sedan that gets you 35 m.p.g., there aren’t many compelling reasons to buy a hybrid,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book.

Tougher competition and diminishing returns at the pump, Mr. Anand said, are big reasons that sales of Toyota’s Prius — long the undisputed king of hybrids — slid 11.5 percent last year to about 207,000.

Consumers are also more inured to spikes in fuel prices, Mr. Anand said, and are prioritizing factors like room, creature comforts or the reassuring all-wheel-drive and ride height of an S.U.V.

“There’s a new normal, and if gas goes back to $3.50 a gallon, it’s ‘Been there, done that’ for consumers,” Mr. Anand said.

Scott Vazin, a Toyota spokesman, acknowledged that there was more technological parity today, but said Toyota had faith in its expanding hybrid lineup.

“We still see hybrid as a clear advantage in overall efficiency,” he said. “They might not be the flavor of the month, but we know where fuel prices are going, and that it’s a finite resource.”

Toyota’s dominance in hybrids remains unchallenged, with Toyota and its Lexus luxury division selling nearly 70 percent of hybrids in America. And with an all-new 2016 Prius heading to showrooms by roughly year’s end, some consumers are holding out until it arrives, analysts said.

For automakers like General Motors, the shift is helping the bottom line. Stronger truck sales alone added $500 million to General Motors’ $2.2 billion first-quarter profit in North America, the best showing since the company exited bankruptcy in 2009. Sales of Chevrolet’s Volt plug-in hybrid fell nearly 19 percent last year, to 18,805 cars.

Yet Pamela Fletcher, General Motors’ executive chief engineer for electrified vehicles, said that G.M. was also taking the long view with its electrified fleet.

“We can’t say, ‘Just kidding, we’re going to put this Volt on the shelf and see where gas prices go,’ ” Ms. Fletcher said.

Instead, G.M. is readying an all-new 2016 Volt for showrooms this fall. Like other automakers, G.M. is striving to cut costs and improve performance of its electrified models to make them more competitive.

Last week, G.M. announced that this fall’s Volt would start at $33,995, $1,175 less than its predecessor, or $26,495 after a $7,500 federal tax rebate.

The sleekly redesigned Volt also promises an improved 50-mile range on electricity alone and higher overall fuel economy, along with room for five passengers instead of four.

Ms. Fletcher noted that hybrid and all-electric loyalists find advantages beyond dollars and cents, from smooth, silent electric operation to the convenience of bypassing the pump to charge at home. And with fuel prices increasing again, industry executives, including Ms. Fletcher, see a return to costly gasoline as merely a matter of time.

But until they experience pain at the pump again, more Americans are adopting an outlook that seems more suited to the 1970s: Keep on Truckin’.","With Gas Prices Less of a Worry, Buyers Pass Hybrid Cars By",2015-05-15,"According to one estimate, more than one in five owners of hybrid and electric vehicles are switching to S.U.V.s instead.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/automobiles/wheels/with-gas-prices-less-of-a-worry-buyers-pass-hybrids-cars-by.html

251,"EDMONTON, Alberta — WHEN I moved from Houston to Edmonton, Alberta, in 2008, I was told to prepare for a soft landing, politically speaking. Alberta was supposed to be just like the Lone Star State: a place full of backslapping good ol’ boys in cowboy hats, riding high on the hog of oil money.

The province’s politics were even more predictable than Texas’. The Progressive Conservative Party had been in power longer than I’d been alive. By the time I arrived, one writer for The Globe and Mail, the country’s leading newspaper, had labeled the place “Saudi Alberta.”

Alberta had indeed become a petrostate: 30 percent of its gross domestic product came directly from oil and gas. Conversations about housing, jobs, health care and even academic research revolved around the price of oil.

But the dependence on oil came at a cost. Despite having the highest wages in Canada, Alberta also has the lowest rate of participation in postsecondary education. Why bother with a degree when you could drive up to the center of the oil industry, Fort McMurray (or as some call it, Fort McMoney), and with a high school diploma, make six figures operating heavy equipment in the oil sands?

This was all part of a grand bargain. Despite the conservative hegemony, Albertans got a steady helping of royalties to fund a decent social safety net while enjoying some of Canada’s lowest taxes.

Oil lubricates everything here, from universal health care to the arts. In an age of academic downsizing, I landed a plum university job bankrolled, in part, by oil royalties. Even stubbornly dissenting media outlets and hip music festivals are underwritten by oil companies. So, regardless of how you may feel about climate change, Albertans know their bread is buttered by sticky tar sands.

Yet this arrangement left an unsavory taste in my mouth. I was an American newcomer who expected better from Canada. But as with the difference between a Tim Horton’s Timbit and a Dunkin’ Donuts Munchkin, I began to realize there are subtle and important differences between how Americans and Canadians view the patrimony of natural resources.

Then came the “Alberta Spring,” the May elections in which the Progressive Conservatives were swept from power by the left-leaning New Democrats. In the run-up to the vote Rachel Notley, the New Democrats’ leader, argued that Alberta’s oil belonged to the people, not to the foreign corporations that do most of the exploration and extraction in the oil sands. She called for a review of the province’s current royalty regime, as well as a 2 percent increase in corporate taxes. It’s hard to imagine mainstream Texas Democrats making that case, let alone sweeping the state elections, and yet that’s precisely what happened in Alberta.

Since the election, Ms. Notley has walked a fine line: reassuring oil companies that she is not some Hugo Chávez of the Prairies, while also vowing to take big oil to task over royalties and environmental issues. Some oil companies have seen the rise of the charming and fresh-faced Ms. Notley as a chance to remake the image of an industry tainted by news stories of train derailments and ruptured pipelines.

To my ears, attuned as they are to the sacred American concept of private property, the idea that ordinary people own natural resources sounds, well, kind of socialist. That may be a dirty word in the States, but so is the business of strip mining the tarlike substance known as bitumen and diluting it to be shipped through pipelines.

The victory of the New Democrats, however, wasn’t necessarily about ideology. It was also about the identity of a province that has evolved from a ranching-and-drilling, meat-and-potatoes kind of place to an urbane, cosmopolitan magnet for people from Brazil to Pakistan looking for a better life.

Albertans have come to see petrostate politics as outmoded, and change at the local level has been happening for years now. In 2010 Naheed Nenshi of Calgary became the first Muslim to be elected mayor of a major North American city. Mr. Nenshi was also the first mayor to lead the gay pride parade in a city best known for its annual stampede. Edmonton’s mayor is a geeky hipster who often rides his bike to work. The ruling Progressive Conservatives were too arrogant to see change coming. In March Alberta’s premier, Jim Prentice, submitted a budget that called for new taxes on individuals and cuts in education but no new taxes on corporations. It was the sort of hubris that could come only from an entrenched party, and it was only a matter of time before New Albertans like me couldn’t tolerate it any longer.

As much as I’d like to see our province become a Norway on the Prairies, with little income inequality, free university education and a healthy environmental movement, I know that isn’t happening. No matter what happens after the Alberta Spring, however, it’s clear that we have a new political landscape, with at least five major parties, all with their own interesting colors and fonts, as well as ideologies, vying for a post-petro-dynasty future. Now that’s something I wish we could put in a pipeline and export down south.","In Alberta, Oil, Cowboys … and Liberalism?",2015-05-20,Some Canadian voters are rethinking the ownership of natural resources.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/opinion/in-alberta-oil-cowboys-and-liberalism.html
252,"More than we may realize, the world has been riding a lucky streak since the global financial meltdown in 2008. How so? The years between 2008 and late 2013 were — relatively speaking — a rather benign period of big power politics and geopolitics. This allowed the major economic powers — the United States, the European Union, China, India, Russia, Brazil and Japan — to focus almost exclusively on economic rehabilitation. But now there are strong indications that our vacation from geo-instability is over.

The last time the world witnessed such a steep and sustained drop in oil prices — from 1986 to 1999 — it had some profound political consequences for oil-dependent states and those who depended on their largess. The Soviet empire collapsed; Iran elected a reformist president; Iraq invaded Kuwait; and Yasir Arafat, having lost his Soviet backer and Arab bankers, recognized Israel — to name but a few. Admittedly, other factors were involved in all these events. But, in each case, steep drops in direct or indirect oil revenues played a big role.

If today’s falloff in oil prices is sustained, we’ll also be in for a lot of surprises. Some will have happy endings. Cuba’s decision to bury the hatchet with America had to have been spurred in part by Havana’s fears of losing some or all of the 100,000 barrels of subsidized oil a day it gets from the now cash-strapped Venezuela. Others could be very destabilizing. Today’s world is much more tightly interconnected and interdependent than in the last oil price drop-off, which was before the spread of the Internet. And today’s world has so many more actors — superpowers and superempowered individuals and hackers who can destabilize companies and countries with cyberweapons. See dictionary for “Sony” and “North Korea.”

When I hear President Vladimir Putin of Russia bragging that lower oil revenues won’t affect the Russian people because they are stoic — look what they tolerated in World War II — my reaction is: “Mr. Putin, that was before there was a significant urban middle class in Russia, one you helped to build with trickle-down oil and gas revenues.” A lot more Russians today have gotten used to traveling abroad, owning a car (note Moscow’s traffic jams), consuming Western goods and seeing how the rest of the world lives. Let’s see how stoic they are today. Russia’s former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin was quoted by The Financial Times on Monday as saying, “There will be a fall in living standards. It will be painful. Protest activity will increase.”

The Western sanctions on Putin’s banks, combined with the sudden sharp drop in oil prices and capital flight also triggered by the sanctions, mean that Russia has a dangerous gap between the funds flowing into its economy and what it needs to send out to pay its debts and finance its imports. Putin can’t relieve the pressure without a lifting of Western sanctions. That would require him to reverse his seizure of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine.

If Putin admits his Ukraine adventure was a mistake, he will look incredibly foolish and the long knives will be out for him in the Kremlin. If he doesn’t back down, Russians will pay a huge price. Either way, that system will be stressed with unpredictable spillovers on the global economy. Remember: Russia’s 1998 economic collapse — also triggered by low oil prices and the moratorium it declared on payments to foreign debtors — helped to sink the giant American hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, sparking a near meltdown on Wall Street.

A prolonged drop in oil prices will impact Algeria, Iran and Arab Gulf states, where aging regimes have used high oil prices to increase government salaries to buy quiet from their people during the Arab Spring. Also, in an age when machines and software are ensuring that average is over for workers in developed countries, and everyone needs to be upgrading their skills, what happens to the developing Arab states and Iran, who have used oil money to mask their deficits in knowledge, education and women’s empowerment? Egypt’s military-led government is highly in need of Arab oil money to get through its crisis. A bit of good news: The Islamic State, which depends on oil smuggling, will fail at governing even faster than it already has.

Meanwhile, Turkey’s increasingly tyrannical president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been arresting domestic opponents, is looking like “Vladimir Putin Jr.” Erdogan is a tragic figure because he did much to build Turkey’s economy into a powerhouse. But, today, according to The Financial Times, Turkey now “needs more than $200 billion of foreign financing a year, more than a quarter of gross domestic product, to maintain its current level of growth.” There will be less Arab and Russian oil money for that and, last week, with Erdogan being criticized by the European Union (a big source of investment income) for arresting his opponents, the Turkish lira hit a low against the dollar. Watch that space.

High oil prices covered many sins and fostered many sins. If they stay low again for long, a lot of leaders will have to pay retail for their crazy politics, not wholesale. The political and geopolitical fallouts will be varied — good and bad — but fallout aplenty there will be.",Is Vacation Over?,2014-12-24,We haven&#8217;t seen the ramifications of the drop in global oil prices yet.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/opinion/thomas-friedman-is-vacation-over.html
253,"HOUSTON — The benchmark American oil price fell below the symbolic $80-a-barrel threshold on Monday, swooning to two-year lows, after Saudi Arabia aimed to shore up its dwindling exports to the United States by cutting its selling price for the American market.

The Saudi move and the deepening fall in oil prices are both symptoms of the oil-drilling boom in the United States, which has lifted production by more than 70 percent over the last six years and reduced the nation’s imports from OPEC producers to roughly half of what they once were.

The lower oil prices are bringing relief to consumers at the pump in time for the holiday shopping season. The national average price for regular gasoline has fallen below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, and experts say it could easily drop 25 cents more over the next month.

A sustained drop in oil prices could also eventually affect investments in domestic drilling. Most analysts do not think the rise in domestic oil production — an increase totaling more than a million barrels a day over the last year alone — will be interrupted anytime soon unless the American benchmark drops to $70 a barrel and stays there for several months. Then less efficient or highly indebted smaller producers would probably have to slow drilling in at least some fields.

The cut in Saudi prices for various grades of crude to the United States was modest — roughly 45 cents a barrel. But the move was viewed by many energy experts as a sign that the kingdom was trying to compete with American oil to protect its market share.

Saudi Arabia considers its relationship to the United States to be a cornerstone of its foreign policy and its security, and it is a partner with Royal Dutch Shell in owning several refineries on the Gulf of Mexico coast — in part to assure that the Persian Gulf kingdom will remain an important supplier to the American market.

The price cut came as Saudi Arabia raised its selling prices in Asia, confusing many experts about its intentions. The move in Asia reversed Saudi cuts in oil prices there in recent months to compete with oil from Nigerian and other African suppliers, which helped push down world prices early last month.

Saudi Arabia has been competing vigorously in Asia against an influx of African oil that had once been pumped for the American market. That oil has recently been pushed almost completely out of the American market because of the increased United States production of similar grades of shale oil.

Several oil analysts said the reaction to the Saudi move, which many characterized as otherwise modest, demonstrated the skittishness of commodity traders over the slowing European and Asian economies.

Value Lost $120 a barrel PRICE OF OIL 110 100 90 80 MONDAY $78.78 70 Near-month futures contracts 60 ’11 ’12 ’13 ’14

The American West Texas Intermediate benchmark price had been moving modestly higher in the early part of the day until the new Saudi prices were reported. Light, sweet oil for delivery in December quickly fell $1.76, to $78.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a decline of more than 2 percent. It was the lowest settlement price recorded since June 2012.

“The price is going to continue to go down because the market continues to be oversupplied,” said Lawrence Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which is partly financed by the oil industry. “The Saudi move today doesn’t address the fact that there is too much supply chasing too little demand.”

Brent crude, which was also higher for parts of the day, fell along with the American benchmark by $1.08, to $84.78 a barrel. That represents about a 25 percent drop since the early summer, when oil prices soared as fighting intensified in Iraq, a critical member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

OPEC is scheduled to meet Nov. 27 in what could become a power struggle between members that are comfortable with lower prices and others, like Venezuela, that seek a cut in production to shore up prices.

Many analysts say that oil prices might recover by then, at least somewhat, if the Islamic State forces reinvigorate their offensive in Iraq or if competing militias interrupt renewed exports of Libyan oil, which have unexpectedly added more than 600,000 barrels of oil to the world market in recent months.",U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel,2014-11-04,"Saudi Arabia reduced its price for oil to America, causing oil prices to decline.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html

CAIRO — When President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt said he intended to raise the price of flour, rice and other subsidized goods in 1977, he ignited days of riots that left more than 70 people dead and stood as a lasting warning to his successors about the perils of forcing impoverished Egyptians to make do with even less.

So it was a surprise when, as one of his first major policy initiatives, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi sharply raised fuel prices two weeks ago, cutting deeply into energy subsidies, the most expensive single part of the government’s sprawling and expensive subsidy system. Even more surprising, perhaps, has been the absence of widespread civil unrest.

The relative quiet appeared to signal an acknowledgment among many Egyptians that the fuel prices, which were among the lowest in the world, could not stay that way forever in an economy battered by years of political turmoil and edging ever closer to collapse. And it was a singular demonstration of presidential clout by Mr. Sisi, who used the kind of emotional appeals he has deployed throughout his rise to power to sell the subsidies as necessary, bitter medicine, as well as a public obligation to a charismatic leader.

“You called upon me for a mission — a mission to save a nation,” Mr. Sisi said in a speech after the price increases were announced, invoking the sacrifices of a previous generation during wartime. “The contract between you and me was that you work hard and bear with me,” he said.

While experts on Egypt’s economy praised the boldness of the move, there was also criticism of how it was put into effect, and of a lack of a clear plan to ease the burden on the country’s most vulnerable citizens. There was no easy way to fix the subsidy program in a country where half the population lives around or below the poverty line and relies on government support. Any mistakes carried considerable risks for the government, which faces a more impatient nation since President Hosni Mubarak was thrown out of office by protesters demanding “bread, freedom and social justice.”

“From a political perspective, sooner rather than later was the right thing, but they have not necessarily prepared the Egyptian population most affected by this for what is going to be a tough and long road,” said Steven A. Cook, an expert in Egyptian affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations. “And I’m not convinced there’s enough of a Sisi mystique to carry them along.”

The decades-old system, which provides subsidies for energy and food, including sugar, flour and tea, had eaten up more than 26 percent of the national budget annually. It also was criticized for inefficiency, benefiting companies, for instance, rather than Egypt’s poorest citizens. Reforming the system was seen as an attempt by the Egyptian government not just to plug a budget deficit that reached more than 12 percent of G.D.P., but also to impress international lenders, like the International Monetary Fund, as the country searched for new financing beyond the generous sums provided over the last year by wealthy Persian Gulf states.",Egypt Cuts Tax Breaks for Fuel; Few Protest,2014-07-18,Critics say that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi call for a drastic cut to energy subsidies in order to decrease the country’s budget deficit will harm vulnerable citizens.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/middleeast/egypt-cuts-tax-breaks-for-fuel-few-protest.html

It wasn’t quite a Jed Clampett moment: Instead of shootin’ for some food, Samuel Kier was drillin’ for some salt in his salt wells in the appropriately named Saltsburg in Indiana County, Pa., close to Pittsburgh.

He kept finding this smelly and gooey black stuff coming from the ground, fouling the salt — sometimes almost spontaneously catching fire.

Trying to make lemonade out of this lemon, he experimented with the gooey stuff. By 1848 he started selling a distillate of it as Seneca Oil, an elixir, and then a proto-Vaseline as a topical ointment.

It wasn’t until 1851 that Mr. Kier became the first oil baron when he started manufacturing Carbon Oil, a kerosene that would replace whale oil as a fuel for lamps. By 1853, Mr. Kier was making as much as $40,000 a year, a mighty sum, from his new refinery.

By the late 1850s, prospectors were billowing about western Pennsylvania, looking for deposits of what came to be called “petroleum,” much like those who prompted the California gold rush a decade earlier.

In the last decade, too, prospectors — this time mostly larger mining corporations — have come to seek a new Pennsylvania fuel bonanza in the Marcellus shale fields. While it may seem incongruous in the modern day, Pennsylvania was where the American oil industry started, well before it moved southwest to places like Texas, and now it is experiencing a renaissance.

“Kier discovered so much oil, he didn’t know what to do with it,” said Charles McCollester, retired professor of industrial labor relations at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. “The Delaware Indians in northwest Pennsylvania, where oil would bubble to the surface, considered it the blood of the Evil One oozing out of the Earth.”

In 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the first big mechanical oil well in Titusville, Pa. Mr. Drake’s well, only 69 feet deep, produced the first “gusher,” the oil coming out so quickly it was difficult to cap. It made Mr. Drake and his backers rich for two years, until those who came after him drilled so much in places around him, like Oil City and Pithole, that they drove the price down, forcing Mr. Drake to close shop.

“Oil has always been a boom and bust,” said Philip Scranton, professor of history emeritus at Rutgers.

Nonetheless, thanks to the modern techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, there has been an 1860s-like growth of shale drilling in Pennsylvania throughout the northern counties and southwestern part of the state. According to Mark Price, a labor economist with the Keystone Research Council in Harrisburg, in 2005, there were only eight wells dug in the state’s Marcellus region. By 2008, the state had 335 new wells, and three years later, nearly 2,000 wells were drilled. He said there was not a big explosion in new wells right now, but he expected the industry to stay at its current levels for a while.

In the 19th-century Pennsylvania oil boom years, cities would be founded, grow exponentially in a short time, then become almost ghost towns as prices rode the roller coaster down. Titusville, site of Mr. Drake’s well, went from 250 residents in 1859 to 10,000 five years later. Pithole was four huts when the boom came in early 1865 and had 50 hotels or rooming houses by the year’s end.

Pennsylvania’s current boom is similar, if more modest.

“Certainly, no matter how you feel about shale drilling, where it has been concentrated, you can point to some economic benefit,” said Mr. Price, offering the far southwestern corner of Pennsylvania as an example. “Greene County has seen an explosion of R.V. parks, where workers have come to live at least temporarily. In the course of the Great Recession, where the rest of the economy was thrashing around, these communities thrived, but then could be threatened when the drillers moved on.”

Mr. Price estimates that about 20,000 people work in the fuel-mining industry in Pennsylvania. “It is a good amount, but only 1 percent of all workers in the state. Nice to have, but it’s not transforming the state’s economy.”

During the 19th-century boom, the domestic output of crude went from 2,000 barrels in 1859, the year of Mr. Drake’s well, to four million barrels in 1869 and 10 million in 1873.

“Around that time, Bradford County had the first billion-dollar field,” said Samuel Slocum, manager of the Penn Brad Oil Museum in Custer City. “They had drilled 40,000 wells producing 82 percent of world’s oil.

“But then when the electric bulb came around, there was no need for kerosene, and the car had not been invented, so it all just died.”

In any case, said Mr. McCollester, prospectors found bigger deposits in Texas, particularly the 1901 gusher known as Spindletop.

“That signaled the end of the Pennsylvania boom. People just moved on to Texas,” he said. There is still a bit of conventional oil drilling in western Pennsylvania, and the brands Pennzoil and Quaker City are reminders of the state’s past oil glory, but the oil is mostly refined as a lubricant, not the in the larger quantities used for fuel.

There has been speculation that the refineries the Pew family built for its huge Sun Oil business in the 19th and early 20th centuries along the Delaware River in and near Philadelphia will be revived. Delta Air Lines has taken over some to refine its own fuel, “but that is a small business, not more than a few hundred workers,” said Professor Scranton of Rutgers. “Still, oil has a rich history in Pennsylvania, and what is going on now is, in many ways, a smaller version of the past.”",Oil Makes a Comeback in Pennsylvania ,2015-04-23,"In the last decade, mining corporations have sought a new Pennsylvania fuel bonanza in the Marcellus shale fields.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/business/energy-environment/oil-makes-a-comeback-in-pennsylvania.html

257,"But Putin also went nuts. Oil at $110 a barrel went to his head. He thought all of this was about him, his decisions, the economy he and his cronies built and on some Russian geopolitical entitlement based on history. In reality, he had bet everything on drilling oil and gas, not on building his people and their talents. He rode the price up and now it is riding him down.

Along the way, Putin lied to the world and deluded himself. His big lie is that the popular toppling of the corrupt government of Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev was just a Western plot to bring Ukraine into NATO. In Putin’s spook-defined world, no one has agency — except the Central Intelligence Agency (or K.G.B.). It is inconceivable to him that a critical mass of Ukrainians might have looked over at Poland and envied how well it had done since freeing itself from the Kremlin’s orbit and joining the European Union — that they might have then said to themselves, “We want that”— and that to get it they might have taken to the streets and overthrown Putin’s ally in Kiev, demanding a less corrupt, more transparent, democratic government.

Putin cast all of that as a C.I.A.-NATO plot in order to rally the Russian people to his side and justify his ugly grab of Crimea and his Ukraine intervention, which included indirect involvement in the shooting down of a Malaysian civilian airliner. The real truth is that Putin is not afraid of NATO expansion to Ukraine. That was never in the cards. He is afraid of European Union expansion. He does not want Ukraine to join the European customs union, adopt its anti-corruption and transparency regulations and begin to build a successful economy on European principles that every day would stand as a contrast to and critique of the nontransparent kleptocracy Putin and his oil-and-gas clique have built in Russia.

His big delusion is that his mind-set is trapped in a 19th-century worldview, where Russia is entitled to and will always have “spheres of influence” on its borders. But spheres of influence are not like some honorary degree you get from Moscow University and can keep forever. Today, spheres of influence have to be earned and re-earned. Because, today, thanks to technology, emergent citizens are able to articulate and organize for their own aspirations much more effectively. These are “people of influence,” and they’ve asserted themselves in squares from Tahrir to Taksim to the Maidan in Kiev. Ukraine may be the first battleground in history where people of influence have squared off against a sphere-of-influence thinker. I am still betting on the people.

Russia’s decline is bad for Russians, but that doesn’t mean it is good for us. When the world gets this interconnected and interdependent, you get a strategic reverse: Your friends, through economic mismanagement (see Greece), can harm you faster than your enemies. And your rivals falling (see Russia and China) can be more dangerous than your rivals rising. If Russia, an economy spanning nine time zones, goes into recession and cannot pay foreign lenders with its lower oil revenues — and all this leads to political turmoil and defaults to Western banks — that crash will be felt globally.

Warren Buffett observed during the 2008 economic crisis that “only when the tide goes out do you find out who is not wearing a bathing suit.” Well, the oil tide has gone out, and it revealed that Putin was swimming naked. In doing so, the country he threatens most today is Russia — but not Russia alone. A triumphant, oil-fueled Russia riding a petro-surge is dangerous; but a defeated, angry, increasingly impoverished Russia is dangerous as well. So despite all of the above, I’d be willing to see the West work with Putin to ease the sanctions on Russia, but only if Putin is ready to stop stealing other people’s marbles, only if he is truly ready to be part of the solution in places like Ukraine — not the problem.",Who&#8217;s Playing Marbles Now?,2014-12-21,There was a lot of Putin envy going around earlier this year.

SYDNEY, Australia — The American energy company Chevron is seeking to sell its entire stake in Caltex Australia for about $3.6 billion, as falling oil prices and high costs have hurt profit margins.

Chevron is offering its 50 percent stake in Caltex, or 135 million shares, at a minimum price of 34.20 Australian dollars, or $26.80, apiece, a 9.7 percent discount to the Friday close, according to a term sheet of the deal. Caltex shares have risen 10.7 percent this year, outpacing a 9.4 percent rise in the benchmark index of Australian shares.

In a statement, Caltex said that Chevron had made clear that the sale was part of a broader portfolio review. “There will be no change to our ability to reliably and competitively deliver all our customers’ fuel requirements,” the statement said.

Goldman Sachs is the sole underwriter for the deal, the terms showed.

Global oil prices have fallen by half since mid-2014, adding to the pressures on Australian refiners, which are also grappling with aging equipment, cheaper imports and high costs. Many companies, including Caltex Australia, have closed refining operations, while others have restructured them.

Chevron is the latest global oil company to leave Australia’s refining industry. Last year, Royal Dutch Shell sold its Australian gas station and refinery operations for about $2.3 billion, and BP is selling its Australian bitumen business, after having shut down its Bulwer Island oil refinery in Queensland.",Chevron Seeks to Sell Caltex Australia Stake for $3.6 Billion,2015-03-28,The proposed sale of the 50 percent stake comes amid falling oil prices and after other global oil companies left Australia’s refining industry.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/business/international/chevron-caltex-australia-stake.html
259,"The volatility in oil prices could also complicate Saudi Arabia’s plans.

If prices remain low for a year or longer, King Salman, who at 79 is reportedly in poor health, may find it difficult to persuade other OPEC members to keep steady against the financial strains. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the revenues of Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies will slip by $300 billion this year.

Even gulf oil officials in recent interviews have said they were surprised by how far and how fast prices have fallen. The expectation appears to have been that a floor would have been found to be $50 to $60 a barrel. The price is currently less than $50.

There have also been rumblings that younger members of the royal family are not happy about falling oil revenue, which will inevitably erode the kingdom’s estimated $750 billion in reserves. Eventual budget cuts could threaten the country’s ample economic safety net, including high-paying public sector jobs and exorbitant energy subsidies.

“Something has got to give,” said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consulting firm, who has advised OPEC in recent years. “The population understands — up to a point — that they will have to cut back.”

Saudi Arabia is the most influential of the 12 OPEC members because it is by far the largest producer and the only one with the ability to substantially vary output to affect markets. In December, Saudi Arabia produced about 9.5 million barrels per day, its average for the year and about 10 percent of the world total.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has adjusted its production in what has been a mostly successful effort to keep markets balanced and prices in the $100-a-barrel range. But as prices began falling last summer, the Saudis and their gulf OPEC allies declined to intervene, contributing to the sharp drop. So far, the Saudis and other Persian Gulf countries appear convinced that cutting in an oversupplied market would only benefit other producers.

A long, stable period of relatively high prices has led producers, mostly outside OPEC, to make huge investments in high-cost endeavors like Canadian heavy oil projects and deepwater fields in Brazil, as well as the shale projects that have greatly increased production in the United States. The Saudi and gulf position is that it will take time for a shakeout to occur among oil producers, which may eventually leave low-cost Middle East producers in a stronger position.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Many United States oil executives blame current Saudi policies for a disquieting bust occurring across the American oil patch. Companies are decommissioning rigs and laying off thousands of workers. They say the Saudis have purposely driven the price of oil down by more than 50 percent since the summer to damp the United States boom in oil shale drilling, which has nearly doubled domestic oil production in the last six years and virtually eliminated imports from several OPEC producers.

“With the new king coming in there is a possibility for change,” said Steve J. McCoy, director of business development for Latshaw Drilling Company of Tulsa, Okla. “If they announce that they are going to reduce their output, within two months we could see an increase in price by at least $30 and get us back to above $75 a barrel.” At current prices, he said, there are few wells worth drilling.

Gulf oil officials say privately that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers have not completely ruled out a cut that might help calm the markets. But the Persian Gulf producers insist that a wide range of countries, including Venezuela and non-OPEC producers like Russia, should participate — a long shot at this point.

“Saudi oil policy is set largely on a technocratic basis,” said Anthony Cordesman, a geopolitical expert who follows Persian Gulf affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is no major international reason for Saudi Arabia to change its current approach.”

Simon Henderson, a Middle East analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said it was most likely that the reins of power, including over oil policy, would be held by a group of advisers now forming around the king.

“Now that he is older, he is likely to take a more hands-off approach, relying on a coterie of advisers, which will probably include several of his sons,” said Mr. Henderson, who has written extensively on Saudi succession issues.",New King in Saudi Arabia Unlikely to Alter Oil Policy,2015-01-24,"The death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is unlikely to deter the nation&#8217;s high level of oil production despite the recent sharp drop in prices, analysts said.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/business/international/king-abdullahs-death-unlikely-to-upset-saudi-oil-goals-analysts-say.html

Falling oil prices typically lead to lower heating bills and cheaper fill-ups at the gasoline pump. Less obvious to the average consumer is the role cheaper oil is playing in driving down mortgage rates.

It is a complicated and indirect link that will likely keep rates low well into 2015, economists say.

Average fixed mortgage rates dropped this month to their lowest levels of the year, according to Freddie Mac. As of Dec. 18, the agency’s weekly mortgage survey showed the 30-year fixed-rate national average was 3.80 percent with an average of 0.6 point. (A point is a fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) The national average for the 15-year fixed-rate loan was 3.09 percent, also with an average of 0.6 point.

Mortgage rates are largely driven by the bond markets and most closely follow the yields (or rates of return) on United States Treasuries. The Freddie Mac survey noted that the bottoming out of average fixed rates earlier this month followed the lowest yields on 10-year Treasuries since May 2013.

So why the decline in yields? The answer, at least in part, has to do with the prolonged slump in oil prices. The price of Brent crude, a benchmark for international prices, which peaked at $115 a barrel in mid-June, has been trading in the $60 range.

In general, interest rates tend to be very sensitive to inflation. Because cheaper oil lowers costs throughout the American economy, inflation is pulled downward as well, said Keith Gumbinger, the vice president of HSH.com, a financial publisher. In turn, lower inflation can allow for interest rates in general to decline.

That effect has been exacerbated of late by global investors’ concerns about the ailing economies in oil-producing countries, especially Russia. If low oil prices are a boon for consuming nations, they can be detrimental to the economies of producing nations, Mr. Gumbinger said.

“Markets that would normally be pumping oil and getting dollars will get far fewer dollars — and the prospects for those countries are lower,” he said.

The United States, in contrast, with its strong dollar and strengthening economy, looks like a far safer bet for global investors, said Nela Richardson, the chief economist for Redfin, a national real estate brokerage. And many of them are seeking shelter in United States Treasuries.

“Investor demand is chasing that strong dollar into U.S. bonds, and those investors are requiring less yield,” Ms. Richardson said. “And as investors require less yield to invest in those bonds, it also decreases mortgage rates.”

How long low oil prices will help support low mortgage rates is anybody’s guess. For one thing, nobody really knows when oil prices will turn around and go the other way, Mr. Gumbinger said. But sustained low-level energy prices also could eventually have a counter effect on interest rates, he said, “by adding hundreds of billions of dollars” to consumer spending.

Rates could begin to creep up if the economy continues to strengthen, Ms. Richardson said. “If firms start hiring again, and wages increase — that’s when the level of all interest rates in the U.S. would increase,” she said.

And then there’s the role of the Federal Reserve. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, recently said that the central bank expects to raise interest rates in 2015, sometime after late April. But Ms. Richardson predicts that global concerns will exert far more influence over interest rates than the Fed, which could mean mortgage rates will stay well below 5 percent for yet another year.

The takeaway for home buyers, Ms. Richardson added, is “there’s not a lot of urgency.”",How Cheaper Oil Affects Mortgage Rates,2014-12-28,Falling prices indirectly help lower the cost of borrowing.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/realestate/how-cheaper-oil-affects-mortgage-rates.html

The deal will unite two big exploration and production companies, both of which have a strong presence in the Bakken and Three Forks formations, some of the most oil and gas rich areas of the Dakotas and Montana.

Combined, Whiting and Kodiak will be the biggest producer in the region, the companies said, producing more than 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

“That was the real reason we came together,” James J. Volker, Whiting’s chief executive, said in an interview.

The combined company will have 855,000 net acres, and 3,460 future drilling locations.

Both companies are based in Denver, and have competed for many years. “The two companies, culturally, are very similar,” Lynn A. Peterson, Kodiak’s chief executive, said in an interview. “It was a natural fit.”

The companies hope to achieve cost savings by combining their workforces.

“The savings can be a billion dollars to us over time, most of that over the next five years,” Mr. Volker said. “Our two acreage positions fit together hand in glove.”

Mr. Peterson said it was a good deal for Kodiak shareholders.

“There’s tremendous upside, that’s why we were comfortable with a stock transaction,” he said. “We wanted to give our shareholders an opportunity to participate in the upside.”

Under the terms of the deal, Kodiak shareholders will receive .177 of a share of Whiting stock for each share of Kodiak common stock they own, or about $13.90 a share. That amounts to a small premium of just 5 percent above Kodiak’s volume weighted average price over the last 60 trading days.

Whiting shareholders will own 71 percent of the combined company, and Kodiak shareholders 29 percent.

American history is littered with oil busts that created big winners and losers.

Now, as the cracks appear in the latest energy boom, the forces of failure and opportunity are stirring again. Resolute Energy, a Colorado company that borrowed big in the boom, is among those in an endgame that is being played up and down Wall Street and in the vast oil fields that new drilling methods have opened in recent years.

It is a struggle that could take place at scores of other companies, leading to thousands of layoffs, as well as losses for banks and investors. At the same time, new fortunes stand to be made.

When Resolute set out three years ago to buy thousands of acres in the oil patch of West Texas, lenders showered the company with hundreds of millions of dollars. But the company had little expertise in the costly and complicated horizontal drilling that it employed on its new property.

Such easy money has abruptly come to an end, mostly because oil prices have plunged, potentially making life much harder for companies like Resolute. Banks slashed the size of the company’s credit line late last year and imposed new lending conditions. Its stock has ​plummeted, and now trades for mere pennies.

The sudden drop in oil prices, incited by fears of a global supply glut and waning demand, caught the oil industry and its lenders by surprise. Many companies, which only a few months ago were the toast of the high-yield debt and initial public offering markets, suddenly cannot raise additional equity or sell bonds. A few lenders have started reining in bank lines and more are expected to tighten loan terms in the coming months.

“If you give an oil guy a dollar, he’s going to use it to drill,” said H. B. Juengling, a vice president of investor relations at Resolute. “But the available funding is starting to close down.”

Over the last five years, oil and gas companies have issued bonds and taken out loans that are together worth $1.2 trillion, according to data from Dealogic. A cutback in drilling is expected to affect communities across the country. The boom created at least 200,000 jobs at oil and gas companies over the last five years, according to an analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

​The latest boom was defined by risk-taking that involved deploying new technologies in oil fields that were once thought not productive drilling sites. As the free flow of credit dwindles, however, energy analysts expect much more caution from an industry that has been willing to bet the farm on increasingly ambitious projects. ​

​ Signs of trouble have brought out Wall Street’s bottom feeders. They are sniffing around companies that appear to have crippling debt loads, companies like American Eagle Energy and Quicksilver Resources.

Resolute recently cut a deal to buy time, borrowing from a hedge fund called Highbridge Capital Management to help pay off previous debts. Highbridge is taking the risk that its loan may not be paid back in full, but it may have calculated that it can profit by charging a high interest rate on its $150 million loan, and by seizing assets in a potential bankruptcy. The loan carries an interest rate of more than 10 percent and is backed by Resolute’s vast array of oil fields in Wyoming, Utah and Texas, which could skyrocket in value if oil prices recover.

​Highbridge declined to comment.

Other opportunistic investors are firing up their spreadsheets.

“The single best opportunity to invest is distressed debt in energy,” David M. Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group, said in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Rubenstein added that one promising strategy might be to “buy the debt at a discount and take control of these companies.” The Blackstone Group and Apollo Global Management say that they are raising billions of dollars to invest in energy assets.

But the energy companies are not going to give up easily.

The squeeze is tightest when companies face a deadline to pay back money they have borrowed. But many firms won’t face such pressures for many months — and the oil price may have recovered by then, particularly if the cut in drilling reduces supply. Many firms hope to weather this turbulence. And Wall Street may simply be wrong in predicting far-reaching distress in the energy sector. Investment firms often promote big ideas as a way to raise money, which they may then struggle to invest for lack of opportunities.

Still, many analysts say that oil prices could remain below $60 a barrel for the rest of the year. OPEC has chosen not to cut production as a way of propping up prices, a move that seems intended in part to deflate the shale boom in the United States, which has caused a surge in domestic oil production.

The longer prices stay low, the less financial sense it makes to keep drilling.

Resolute is determined to ride out the slump. The company was founded, like many other entrants in the red-hot oil industry, by a group of longtime oilmen and private equity investors.

The company’s chairman, Nicholas J. Sutton, was in semiretirement when a Chevron executive told him the oil company was looking to sell portions of the Aneth oil field in southeastern Utah, including a large patch on the Navajo Indian reservation.

Mr. Sutton and his other co-founders teamed up with private equity backers to buy the Aneth property in 2004. At the time, the field’s reserves totaled 1.5 billion barrels of oil — considered by geologists one of the world’s “giant” oil fields.

In 2009, Resolute merged with an investment firm run by Thomas O. Hicks, a former owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team and the Liverpool soccer club, and became a publicly traded company.

The merger infused Resolute with cash, but its debut as a public company brought expectations to increase its revenue more quickly.

Aneth was a giant field, but its reserves were gradually declining. The shale revolution sweeping the United States promised more explosive growth.

In late 2012, Resolute borrowed roughly $150 million in the bond market and acquired premium acreage in the Permian Basin of West Texas, one of the nation’s hottest shale plays.

At first, Resolute planned to drill vertically in the Permian, a process the company’s founders had done for years. But after watching competitors with nearby wells have success with horizontal drilling — which involves boring into shale at a horizontal angle — Resolute switched course.

The company’s foray into horizontal drilling proved costly.

“When you go into a new area, you have to spend a lot of upfront capital,” said Carin Dehne-Kiley, an energy analyst with Standard & Poor’s. “But the costs were higher than they anticipated and the price of oil is lower than they anticipated.”

The company’s high leverage — the amount of debt relative to its profit — left Resolute little room for error.

To raise cash, Resolute planned to sell some of its oil fields in Aneth to a private investment fund, but the deal fell through in March.

The fall in oil prices increased the pressure on the company. Resolute’s oil reserves — which banks used as collateral — were suddenly worth much less. Resolute’s bank lenders decreased the company’s credit line to $330 million from $425 million.

Resolute had to use the $150 million loan from Highbridge, the hedge fund, to pay off some of its outstanding bank line balance.

In recent months, many oil producers have said the lower prices are forcing them to cut back on production, But Resolute has not announced any plans for the year.

“If anyone says they know what oil prices are going to be, they are wrong.” said Mr. Juengling, who has worked in the industry for 30 years. “No one knows how low it will go or how long it will take to go back up.”","Slump in Oil Prices Brings Pressure, and Investment Opportunity",2015-02-02,"Scores of debt-laden oil companies face struggles that could lead to layoffs and losses for banks and investors.

PARIS — Around the world, the giant oil companies of the United States and Europe are putting the brakes on a decade-long spending spree focused on finding and developing offshore oil fields in ever-tougher environments.

The reason: Soaring costs are outpacing foreseeable rises in energy prices.

Oil majors like Total and Chevron are now prepared to ditch or delay costly megaprojects, putting off investment decisions or reducing exposures that they deem too risky.

This is a major shift in an industry that has been focused for years on chasing production growth at any cost.

“We’re certainly seeing projects being pushed back,” said Iain Pyle, an analyst with the investment research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, based in London. “I think, rather than it being delays due to problems with the projects or operational issues, it is companies saying they won’t approve a project because it looks too expensive.”

“Production might be lower than what people expected” as a result, he noted. “But the trade-off is capital expenditure control, improved free cash flow — a situation that investors would much rather have.”

Total made the highest investments in its history over the past three years, drilling in areas that were hard and costly to explore. Now, it is at the forefront of a drive by companies including BP and Royal Dutch Shell to contain costs, cut spending and sell assets to shore up their finances.

“We have to curb costs, as we can’t count on oil and gas prices’ continuing to rise,” Total’s chief executive, Christophe de Margerie, told journalists at a recent energy conference. He warned that some projects would be put on the back burner or even abandoned if ways to cut costs could not be found.

Reflecting its new cost-control strategy, Total announced in May that it had sold its minority stake in the Shah Deniz 2 gas project in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan, one of the world’s largest and at $45 billion one of the most expensive, just a few weeks after Norway’s Statoil also sold out. In April, Total said it was slashing spending on a deep and complex project off Angola.

Analysts say the oil majors are trying to avoid repeating mistakes caused by an unshakable belief in rising oil and gas prices that led them to take overly risky investment decisions.

A casebook example is Kashagan, a giant Caspian oil and gas field discovered off Kazakhstan in the early 1990s and developed by international oil companies. A highly challenging project, it is years behind schedule, plagued by cost overruns — and now halted by leaks from corroded pipelines.

“I don’t know if Kashagan will be a loss-making operation, but there is a risk,” said Pierre Terzian, head of Petrostrategies, a French consulting and publishing firm.

The investment per barrel in Kashagan was almost five times higher than a typical Iraqi or Saudi field, Mr. Terzian said, and companies have become wary of the danger of finding themselves trapped in excessively high-cost projects if oil and gas prices should fall.

Still, the International Energy Agency, the intergovernmental body in Paris that coordinates national energy security policies, called in a report this month for the oil industry to keep investing in new output, in particular in the Middle East, to avoid a supply shortfall that could spark tighter and more volatile oil markets, with prices on average rising $15 per barrel by 2025.

Analysts at Bernstein say oil prices are likely to remain stable in the near term, but they also point to a long-term uptrend, with prices underpinned by rising costs. They predict that oil prices will rise to an average of $132 per barrel in 2018, from $110 per barrel now.

Service costs have swelled 7 to 8 percent a year since 2011, according to industry experts, while the price of oil has stabilized, squeezing producers’ margins to the thinnest in almost a decade. Because they are big, complex, often inaccessible and needing highly skilled workers, megaprojects have even higher costs, they say.

Some senior industry executives complain that recent cost inflation has been only partly justified by the technological challenges of producing oil in extreme conditions.

Higher billings by service providers in the past three or four years have been “far in excess of what we would consider normal,” said Arnaud Breuillac, head of production and exploration at Total.

If high costs should force the cancellation or delay of large development projects, “this oil will not be in the market 10 years from now, which will lead to an oil price rise that could be detrimental to the world economy,” he warned.

This argument does not sit well with oil field service companies, which argue that their revenue is not increasing. The real problem lies with poor investment decisions by the oil majors, they say.

“When you look at our industry, I don’t think that it is making a lot more money than it was three, four or five years ago,” said Julian Waldron, chief financial officer at the French oil field service company Technip.

“The era of easy to find, easy to extract, easy to process” oil from accessible shallow-water offshore oil fields is over, Mr. Waldron said. If oil majors want to cut costs, they should develop projects more incrementally, he suggested.

The Kashagan field, where oil companies put in big front-end investments, unsupported by production revenue, was an example of what not to do, he said.

“Kashagan, wasn’t that crazy?” Mr. Waldron asked. “Maybe our customers will find ways of proceeding more quickly to generate revenue from first oil and will therefore invest on an incremental basis over the lifetime of a field.”

The prospect of high prices, underpinned by high-cost fields, may be good news for some — not least OPEC, whose member countries pump around a third of the world’s oil supplies. “OPEC is placing all its hopes” in high cost reserves supporting prices, Mr. Terzian of Petrostrategies said, “because it has run out of ideas on how to do so itself.”",Pressure on Oil Megaprojects,2014-06-18,"Costs are soaring as prospects for profit slide, so the majors are putting on the brakes.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/business/energy-environment/18iht-ren-oil18.html

MEXICO CITY — At the University of Havana in 1999, President Hugo Chávez assailed those who would “ask Cuba to follow the path of false democracy” and declared that Venezuela was “moving toward the same ocean as the Cuban people, an ocean of happiness, of true social justice, of peace.” But the recent steep plunge in oil prices has thrown both Cuba and the Venezuela that supplies its oil into a much more turbulent ocean than Mr. Chávez ever imagined.

To emulate Cuba politically was an inexcusable choice, but Mr. Chávez began carefully to do so. In order to distance Venezuela from “false democracy,” he accumulated control over the organs of government and over much of the information media: radio, television and the press. His successor, Nicolás Maduro, has remained on that road but much more crudely — with little attention to nuance or pragmatic pressures. He took over the rest of Venezuelan television, confronted protesting students with arrests and gunfire (many were killed), and suppressed demonstrations by the opposition while imprisoning the militant leader Leopoldo López.

On the other hand, it did make sense at the time to emulate Cuba’s successful record of social justice. And so starting in 2003, with the approval of Fidel Castro, Mr. Chávez instituted the Missions, staffed with Cuban personnel who — through medical care, education and home construction — bettered the lives of many Venezuelans. But the cost of the program was exorbitant.

Venezuela absorbs 45 percent of Cuba’s trade deficit. Chávez-era economic agreements with Cuba were all highly favorable to the island nation. The expenses for the Missions (consisting of 40,000 Cubans, especially doctors and nurses) involved Venezuelan payments of about $5.5 billion annually, of which the Cuban regime retained 95 percent, the rest going toward paying the doctors (though thousands have defected to other countries in recent years). Oil was supplied at such low prices that Cuba could turn around and refine and export some of it at a profit.

Economic ties with Cuba were only one element in Venezuela’s care-free use of oil profits for political purposes. But in early 2008 the price of a barrel of oil stood at $145(and the Venezuelan government believed that it could rise as high as $250). Venezuelan aid to Cuba seemed merely one large drop within the projected “ocean of happiness.” In a display of economic machismo, Mr. Chávez accelerated his policy of expropriations and nationalizations, without apparently taking stock of the fact that Raúl Castro had begun market reforms that were lessening the direct role of the state and opening some space for the free market. This was completely contrary to the statist model that Mr. Chávez was expanding in his country.

But now, just as Venezuela limps through the crisis of a shortage of basic supplies, the price of oil has fallen to less than $50 a barrel. The average Venezuelan is mainly worried about being able to buy food and medicine. Supermarket shelves are nearly empty; lines of shoppers wind around corners. The army has been instructed to arrest anyone who breaks ranks or obtains even so much as a chicken more than his formal allotment, and they are legally permitted to fire on demonstrators.

Mr. Maduro’s government insists that the crisis is an “economic war” conducted by the right and refuses to alter the nation’s currency controls, which favor a black market with its traders who purchase price-controlled products at low prices and resell them at a big profit.

After a worldwide trip to Russia, China, Iran and some Arab states seeking economic aid, Mr. Maduro simply announced to all: “God will provide.” The humorist Laureano Márquez (who belongs to the Venezuelan opposition) produced a widely read public letter purportedly from “God” in which He says: “I already provided you with fertile farmland, plains for the raising of cattle, forest tracts where you can grow cacao and coffee, major navigable rivers, beaches for tourism. ... Underground I gave you the largest oil reserves in the planet and ... gold, aluminum, bauxite, diamonds ... 15 years of the greatest oil bonanza in the history of humanity ... ”

Further, Mr. Márquez’s “God” cannot comprehend how the Chavistas have managed to ruin Venezuela’s economy. Such is the divine personage’s concern that He ends the letter with: “I’m sorry, my child. I have to tell you that your request for heavenly financing has also failed.”

Since the early years of Cuba’s revolutionary regime, Fidel Castro hungered for access to Venezuela’s oil, which President Rómulo Betancourt denied to him in early 1959 after an acrimonious meeting in Caracas. The Cubans responded by sponsoring unsuccessful guerrilla incursions into Venezuela, and diplomatic ties were severed for years. Then, in 1998, Hugo Chávez — a great admirer of Fidel and the Cuban system — was elected president. The new leader in Caracas moved quickly to help the Cubans, whose economy had fallen into dire straits after Russian subsidies had come to an end by 1992. Beginning in 2003, Venezuela flooded Cuba with oil at bargain prices.

Today, however, the crash in oil prices has devastated Venezuela’s troubled economy, which was already deeply undermined by a hugely corrupt and spendthrift administration. Caracas cannot continue liberally dispensing oil to Cuba and other Latin American countries favored by Chavismo. And Mr. Maduro lacks the charisma and political agility of his predecessor.

The two countries are now caught in an ocean not of “happiness” but of contrary currents and dangerous waves. Parliamentary elections due at the end of this year will probably be the turning point for Venezuela. Polls show the Maduro government has only a 22 percent approval rating; that figure is unlikely to go up between now and the vote.

If control of Congress were to shift from the Chavistas to the opposition, Venezuela could begin a process of national reconciliation, open up to the free market and establish democratic normality. This would be the best possible medicine for the country’s battered economy and damaged social institutions. But if such changes don’t come peacefully, then the outlook for Venezuela may well be even grimmer.

LONDON — The outlook for oil prices is still uncertain after the sharp fall that began last summer, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.

Given the price collapse, “one might be hoping for more clarity on supply and demand,” the agency acknowledged in its monthly Oil Market Report, which was released on Wednesday. “Yet in some ways, the outlook is only getting murkier.”

Oil prices, which have fallen about 50 percent since June, rose after the report and a separate United States government report that said that American crude stockpiles had risen less than expected.

The international benchmark, Brent crude, was up about 3 percent on Wednesday, to $60.35, while its American counterpart jumped more than 5 percent to about $55.97.

The agency’s report reflects a broad debate inside and outside the oil industry about where prices might eventually settle.

Citigroup, for one, expects prices to continue falling in the coming months, as output remains high, supply is building up and investors who had helped prop up prices begin to sell.

“While prices have held relatively firm, there are significant signs of weakness ahead,” Citigroup said in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Royal Dutch Shell, the oil giant that announced an almost $70 billion takeover of the British oil and gas producer BG Group last week, is expecting prices to recover much of their recent drop over the next few years. It projects prices to hit $90 a barrel in 2018.

As the International Energy Agency noted, competing forces are still playing out in the market, making the direction difficult to discern. Low prices have stimulated higher-than-expected demand for oil products in China, India and even Europe, which has been plagued by lethargic economic growth, the agency said. But whether that increased consumption is a “temporary aberration” remains to be seen, it added.

There is much uncertainty, for instance, over future crude demand from China, which on Wednesday reported economic growth of 7 percent, the weakest rate since early 2009.

Supply is also hard to gauge. While there are signs that low prices are beginning to have an impact on the production of oil from shale rock, overall oil output in the United States is expected to grow this year, the agency said.

In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is showing no signs of backing away from the policy, backed by Saudi Arabia, of holding onto market share regardless of falling prices. OPEC production rose almost 900,000 barrels a day in March from a month earlier, the agency said, as Saudi Arabia increased production to more than 10 million barrels per day.

Among the uncertainties in the market is the potential effect on oil supplies of a proposed nuclear accord with Iran, a major producer, the agency said. International sanctions have sharply reduced the country’s sales of oil, and an accord is expected to ease, or lift, those sanctions.

While it would take time for Iran to organize the enormous investment that would be required to sustainably bolster its production capacity, the agency said that the country might be able to make short-term changes to increase output and exports relatively quickly.

For instance, the agency said, Iran has 30 million barrels of oil stored on tankers, which could quickly feed an increase in exports. The agency also estimated that Iranian oil fields could ramp up production to as much as 3.6 million barrels a day, a 29 percent increase, within months of sanctions being lifted.

Specialists have been working at some of those sites, and “some of Iran’s core fields,” which were run down, may already have been revived, the agency said.

Under the pressure of sanctions, both Iranian production and exports have been curbed. Exports are down about 50 percent since 2012, to an average of around 1.1. million barrels a day, though they rose to 1.3 million barrels a day in March on high demand from China.","Outlook for Oil Prices ‘Only Getting Murkier,’ Energy Agency Says",2015-04-16,"There is much uncertainty over future crude demand from China and supply from OPEC, the International Energy Agency said.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-international-energy-agency.html
266,"I thought I knew from olive oil. My father sold a dozen brands of imported extra-virgin olive oil at his Italian grocery store in Niagara Falls, N.Y. Long before the Mediterranean diet became chic, he told his customers that olive oil trumped butter on pasta, bread and green vegetables and even in most pastries. The best Christmas present he could give me, once I grew up, was a case of four one-gallon tins of his best brand.

Bologna Adriatic Sea Florence UMBRIA Perugia Lake Trasimeno Spello Acqualoreto ITALY Tyrrhenian Sea Rome 50 miles

When I was posted to Rome as Newsweek’s bureau chief in the 1980s, I lived in an apartment that had belonged to the film star Anna Magnani. Her son, Luca, was my landlord, and every winter the Magnani family housekeeper brought me enormous dark green glass jugs of the sweet olive oil that had been produced on the family estate near Rome. I became so addicted to it that I shipped several jugs when I moved back to New York.

But here I was in Spello, confronted with an oil that was not for the timid of tongue. If Cuore Verde were a movie star, it would be Marcello Mastroianni as Guido in Fellini’s “8 1/2” — intense, biting and dark. It should be poured with gusto on a rich legume soup, or maybe on bruschetta topped with a generous slice of pecorino Romano. It would never work on black truffles or sole.

Umbrian oil makes up only about 2 percent of Italy’s olive oil production but wins a far larger proportion of awards. It begged for further investigation. So when I drove an hour southwest to visit a friend in Acqualoreto, she took me to meet Pietro Marruco, 30, who with nine other investors had built a state-of-the-art olive oil mill for $1 million to service olive growers from all over the region.

Mr. Marruco is determined to keep his oils, which are sold under a number of names, traditional, local and pure. All of his olives come from within 20 miles of the mill. He curses the companies that have given Italian olive oil a bad name.

“The big groups have killed our market and our reputation,” he said. “My passion is making beautiful oils that very few people make.”

The mill mainly handles three types of olives — moraiolo (intense), leccino (prolific) and frantoio (sweet) — which are washed, crushed into paste, pressed into oil and stored in huge stainless steel vats infused with nitrogen to keep oxygen out. Hundreds of dark bottles stood empty in a storage room; they are filled with oil only when it is ready to be shipped.

Mr. Marruco prides himself on the diversity of his oils. “Leccino and frantoio are soft and sweet, like a very likable woman,” he said. “Moraiolo is a hard, strong woman, a rock.”

I preferred the rock. I also preferred Spello, with its crumbling stone walls, winding streets and peach-colored marble buildings. So I returned here and called on Mario Ciampetti, owner of the Hispellum farm, who produces more olive oil than the Antonelli Franceschinis and is the only producer in Spello with his own mill. His Terre Rosse oil is sold abroad, including in Sweden, China and the United States.

“My ambition is not to sell the most oil all over the world,” Mr. Ciampetti said. “It’s to sell my oil to those who appreciate the taste of Umbria in their plate.” Like Cuore Verde, his oil is made only from young, organically grown moraiolo olives; it is also kosher. More delicate than Cuore Rosse, it retains what Mr. Ciampetti calls “the same strong moraiolo personality: spicy and bitter, but not sweet.”

He showed me the remains of a medieval monastery ringed with olive trees, explaining that papal documents from the 12th century attest to the existence of olive trees there. He said mature trees produce better olives. “Like the wise man who gets wiser as he gets older, the taste of the oil improves with the age of the tree,” he said.

The Antonelli Franceschinis, meanwhile, were eager to match Mr. Ciampetti’s hospitality. So they invited me to dinner at their vast Renaissance-era palazzo in the heart of Spello. The museum-quality paintings and ceiling frescoes were rivaled only by the surprises on the table: two dishes prepared with risina beans, tiny black-eyed peas that Mr. Antonelli Franceschini had helped rescue from extinction in Italy.

The bean is believed to have been cultivated near Lake Trasimeno by the ancient Romans or Etruscans. It fell into oblivion in the mid-20th century. One day, an agronomist for the Umbria region approached him with a bottle of seeds.

“He said he trusted me to do something good with them,” Mr. Antonelli Franceschini recalled. “I reproduced them for four years, and in the fifth year, I harvested 200 kilos of risina.”

Ms. Antonelli Franceschini explained that the bean is not really a bean, but a pea called Vigna unguiculata, a cowpea. She said that unlike most dried legumes, it does not have to be soaked in advance. The beans are barely covered with warm water (cold water will make the skins hard) then gently simmered for about 50 minutes.

The first dish she served was a smoked swordfish, arugula and risina bean salad. That was followed by jumbo Adriatic shrimps still in their shells that were accompanied by risina beans prepared with bits of chopped cherry tomatoes. The couple sell risina and other legumes in elegant boxes under the Cuore Verde label.

The next day, we hit mostly winding, rocky dirt roads up and down hills to tour their olive groves. Along the way, they gave me some basic olive oil lessons. One: The worst oil in the world is bottled in clear glass. Two: Storing oil in a tin once it has been opened will give it a cucumber taste. Three: Avoid olive oil with a low price; a $5-a-liter bottle is likely to lack flavor.

From there we trekked through long grass to visit the bean fields, which were in flower. Among the legumes were Umbrian green lentil and baby chickpea, and more unusual varieties like a wild pea named roveja and a squared peasant bean that looks like a small pebble called cicerchia. And of course, risina. “We don’t know how to sell.” Ms. Antonelli Franceschini said. “But we do know how to grow.”

At that moment, I wished that my father were still alive, so I could send him a box of risina beans.","In Umbria, an Italian Olive Oil Worth the Accolades",2014-10-08,Umbrian oil makes up only about 2 percent of Italy&#8217;s olive oil production but wins a far larger proportion of awards.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/dining/in-umbria-an-italian-olive-oil-worth-the-accolades.html

LONDON — Britain is not usually considered the wild frontier of the oil industry, but it is proving to be a tough environment for what had been a fast-growing engineering and construction company called Petrofac.

The company on Monday said that it was likely to incur a deeper loss on an $800 million natural gas plant that it has been building for the French oil giant Total on the Shetland Islands north of Scotland. The company’s stock price dropped about 10 percent in trading on Monday.

The company announced a write-down of 130 million pounds, or about $194 million, less than three months after it disclosed that it would take a $230 million hit on the same project. It said then that it was unlikely to have further losses.

The company’s chief executive, Ayman Asfari, said that in his 35-year career, spanning hundreds of projects in the Russian Arctic, Algerian desert and the tropics of Africa and Malaysia, “I have never faced a more difficult and challenging work environment” than in Britain. He mostly blamed bad weather and labor problems.

The setback highlights that companies in oil services are likely to be among the most vulnerable to the recent steep decline in oil prices. As the major oil companies that are the clients of these companies cut back spending, their revenues are likely to fall and they may run into difficulty over issues like cost overruns.

“In a recessionary or tough oil price environment, standard problems in the construction industry become amplified because when things go wrong no one wants to pay for them,” said Nicholas Green, an analyst at Bernstein Research in London.

Oil prices, which have fallen more than 40 percent since reaching about $110 last June, have been rising over the last month. The international benchmark, Brent crude, was up slightly at about $64 a barrel on Monday.

Despite the latest pledges from Petrofac that it had the North Sea installation under control, analysts said the losses and other problems could worsen. “Management’s assurances have (again) proven to be worth little,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note to clients.

The plant, which is almost finished, will process the output of a large new gas field called Laggan-Tormore, which Total is developing in waters northwest of the islands. The $5.5 billion Laggan-Tormore project is likely to start this year and produce about 90,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, making it one of several substantial new ventures in British waters. Its production will temporarily slow the continuing decline of North Sea output.

Although Britain now produces less than 1 percent of global oil supplies, it remains the second-largest producer in Europe after Norway.

Petrofac, which is based in London and has been largely the creation of Mr. Asfari, has expanded rapidly into one of the world’s larger providers of engineering, construction and other services to the oil industry.

Its recent rise came during an easier high-oil-price environment, largely on the basis of work that Mr. Asfari obtained in North Africa and the Middle East. Over the decade through last year, revenue grew more than sixfold to $6.2 billion, with profit rising about ninefold to $581 million.

That performance seems to have encouraged Mr. Asfari to move into regions where he was less accustomed to doing business, like Britain, and to assume more risk on projects at a time when clients like Total have become less forgiving.

Mr. Asfari, however, blamed the environment in Britain, saying that costs were four times what the company pays elsewhere. The company attributed the new losses to bad weather on the islands, which are known for high winds, and on problems with the British labor unions. Most of Petrofac’s subcontractors had left the project, Mr. Asfari said, leaving the company to complete it largely on its own.

Workers from the GMB union did strike in January over demands that they be compensated for long travel times to the work site from barges where they were being housed. In a brief telephone interview, Phil Whitehurst, a GMB national officer, attributed Petrofac’s problems to its poor management of the gas project.

Mr. Asfari said that Petrofac would need to devote two million more worker hours than planned on the project at a cost of £120 million.

It is no secret that the British oil industry faces difficult problems. Production is in decline, recent exploration results have been poor and costs have been soaring. The costs of producing a barrel of oil had been rising at about 20 percent a year, and some oil and gas fields in the area are said to be losing money.

Mr. Asfari said that his experience indicated that much of Britain’s remaining oil and gas reserves “will remain in the ground.”",Petrofac of Britain Takes Another Write-Down on Gas Project,2015-04-21,The engineering and production company blamed weather and labor problems for a $194 million write-down on a plant in the Shetland Islands.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/business/international/petrofac-of-britain-takes-another-write-down-on-gas-project.html
268,"Lawyers for the shareholders said they expected the government to resist paying the award and that the case could drag on for years. If Russia did not pay, the lawyers said, they would go to court outside Russia to seize state-owned commercial assets, focusing in particular on Rosneft, the state-owned oil giant. Rosneft acquired the crown jewel of Yukos, a unit called Yuganskneftegaz, for a bargain price in the bankruptcy proceedings.

“We are thrilled with this decision, although we know it is not the end of the road,” said Tim Osborne, director of GML, the holding company created by the Yukos founder that owned about 60 percent of the oil company.

Russia’s Ministry of Finance said it would appeal. “Instead of an objective, impartial consideration of the case, the arbitration court ruled based on current developments and as a result adopted a politically biased decision,” it said in a statement on its website.

On Thursday, the European Court of Human Rights will rule on a separate claim for compensation against Russia brought by Yukos management on behalf of all former shareholders.

The potential of a $50 billion payout, even if it took years to collect, could cloud Russia’s already weak economic picture in the near term. Analysts said the ruling could eventually hurt Russia’s ability to borrow in international markets, which is already under threat from sanctions by the United States and Europe.

“The possibility of losing $50 billion in reserves could be a trigger for the rating agencies to revise their outlook for Russia’s financial stability,” said Alexey Pogorelov, an economist at Credit Suisse in Moscow.

The Yukos story traces back to the years after the fall of the Soviet Union. In the early 1990s, Moscow allowed a handful of aggressive traders and financiers to take over much of the oil business and other industries previously controlled by the state. Mr. Khodorkovsky, who had founded a bank called Menatep, gained control of Yukos in 1995 at a cheap price through an auction widely considered rigged.

Despite having little industry knowledge, Mr. Khodorkovsky helped revive the company by bringing in Western techniques like water injection and fracking. Production at Yukos almost doubled between 1995 and 2003.

But Mr. Khodorkovsky fell out of favor with Mr. Putin, who is said to have bridled at the chairman’s rumored political ambitions and aggressive lobbying on business matters. In October 2003, agents arrested Mr. Khodorkovsky at a Siberian airport. He served 10 years in jail on charges of embezzlement and tax fraud before being pardoned by Mr. Putin late last year.

After its owner’s arrest, Yukos’s fortunes took a similar dive and the company was sold off. The key asset ended up with Rosneft, turning the state-controlled oil company from an also-ran into a rival to Gazprom, Russia’s other energy giant.

On Monday, the tribunal did say that Yukos played an aggressive game on taxes and “could have faced some legitimate claims” and that there was a “shamlike nature” to some of its operations. But ultimately it ruled that the “state apparatus decided to take advantage of that vulnerability” to “bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets while at the same time removing Mr. Khodorkovsky from the political arena.”

Shareholders viewed the ruling, made on July 18 and unveiled on Monday, as a victory.

“The findings were predictable for any unbiased observer,” Mr. Khodorkovsky said in an emailed statement. “From beginning to end, the Yukos case has been an instance of unabashed plundering of a successful company by a mafia with links to the state.”

Mr. Osborne, a British tax lawyer who runs GML, said on Monday that he expected Russia to apply to courts in the Netherlands to have the awards set aside. He also indicated that GML would be open to a settlement. “We accept there is a benefit to being paid straight away.”

Emmanuel Gaillard, the Shearman & Sterling partner who headed the shareholders’ legal team, expressed optimism that if Russia did not pay, it would be possible to round up $50 billion of assets “if we pierce the veil of Rosneft and Gazprom.” In other words, the shareholders could go after refineries, pipelines and other properties of Russia’s state energy companies abroad.

Rosneft said on Monday that it “was not a party to and did not participate in the arbitrations and is not bound by the published rulings. Rosneft believes that all of its purchases of former Yukos assets and all other actions taken by it with respect to Yukos were entirely lawful and proper.”

It is unlikely Mr. Khodorkovsky will benefit financially from the verdict. He says he handed over his stake to a partner, Leonid B. Nevzlin, in 2005; Mr. Nevzlin owns about 70 percent of GML. The other key beneficiaries include former business associates of Mr. Khodorkovsky — Platon Lebedev, Vasily S. Shakhnovsky, Mikhail B. Brudno and Vladimir M. Dubov — who own 7.5 percent each, and the pension fund for about 30,000 former Yukos employees.",$50 Billion Awarded in Breakup of Yukos,2014-07-29,A three-member tribunal called the seizure of the Russian oil company a politically driven campaign to neutralize its owner and put its assets under state control.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/business/international/yukos-shareholders-awarded-about-50-billion-in-court-ruling.html
269,"Founded more than a half century ago, OPEC wrenched supremacy over the oil market from the giant multinational energy companies and used its production heft to drive prices. Some Arab members of OPEC staged an oil embargo against the United States and other countries that supported Israel during the war in 1973, a move that increased prices.

In the 1980s, an oil glut emerged as new production came onto the market from Britain, Norway, Alaska and elsewhere. Saudi Arabia slashed production sharply to try to balance the markets. When other producers failed to follow, the Saudis ramped up output, contributing to a price collapse.

Unity among OPEC members has been sporadic ever since, and the group’s options at the moment are not appealing.

If it does cut production significantly and higher prices result, shale drillers in the United States will have an incentive to invest more and increase output. That would only further crowd out OPEC production from world markets.

A long period of low prices might eventually curb shale oil production. But it is far from clear just how bad it would have to become to affect output in the United States.

Even with the recent weakness, American production continues to soar. The Bakken and Eagle Ford shale fields of North Dakota and Texas — two principal drivers of the country’s energy renaissance — increased output by 90,000 barrels a day in October, up 3.4 percent from the previous month, according to Bentek Energy, a consulting firm.

As U.S. output has risen, OPEC, the influential cartel of international producers, has been losing its sway over the global oil markets. 40 million barrels a day $150 Crude oil production Price of oil 30 100 OPEC 20 50 10 U.S. DOMESTIC Generic near-month futures contracts, adjusted for inflation 0 0 ’00 ’05 ’10 ’14 ’00 ’05 ’10 ’14 40 million barrels a day Crude oil production 30 OPEC 20 10 U.S. DOMESTIC 0 ’00 ’05 ’10 ’14 $150 Price of oil 100 50 Generic near-month futures contracts, adjusted for inflation 0 ’00 ’05 ’10 ’14

Low prices also crimp OPEC countries.

Some countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have built up an estimated $2 trillion in rainy-day funds and could withstand a long period of low prices. Others, like Venezuela and Iran, would feel the squeeze. The two countries have called for reductions in supplies, although neither is in the economic position to cut production by itself.

Officials in Saudi Arabia have been largely quiet of late, which is further unnerving markets. Saudi Arabia is the linchpin of the cartel. And analysts say the Saudis and OPEC may be struggling to devise a coordinated strategy to prop up the markets.

“OPEC is watching and not acting because there is literally very little it can do,” says Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president for exploration and production at Saudi Aramco, the national oil company.

OPEC has made difficult decisions before. In 2008, the organization agreed to 4.2 million barrels per day in cuts to stem falling prices during the global financial crisis. It worked, with oil bottoming out around $37 a barrel before steadily recovering.

This time, however, analysts say the organization looks more divided.

“OPEC is split: The majority don’t like the current price levels, the minority don’t mind,” said Kamel al-Harami, former president of Kuwait Petroleum International, a state oil company.

Three Persian Gulf producers in the minority view, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, account for about half of the organization’s output. They are only moderately hurt by the low prices, and may even be helped in the long run if investment in competing high-cost oil fields in Canada and the United States dries up. All three countries are rivals of Iran, which is more vulnerable to lower prices.

But sanctions, internal strife and political turmoil have curbed output in Iran and Venezuela, and left production in Libya unreliable. Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of the market research firm FGE, estimates that as much as 3.5 million barrels per day, more than 10 percent of OPEC’s output, may be off the market for such reasons.

“You have been eating my lunch,” is the general sentiment expressed by such members to their more fortunate brethren, he said.

Energy analysts say that OPEC’s biggest problem is the shale oil revolution in the United States. Railroad tracks connecting North Dakota oil fields to the East Coast have bolstered domestic supplies, forcing Nigerian producers and others in Africa to export more oil to China and the rest of Asia. Saudi Arabia, in turn, has lowered prices to protect its share of the Asian markets.

While there are still restrictions on shipping crude from the United States, there has been a boom in exporting refined products to Europe and elsewhere, further cutting into OPEC markets. As domestic crude production grows, political pressures to remove the export ban altogether are beginning to mount.

Adding to the difficulties, OPEC has been operating without quotas since the end of 2011, when it agreed to a group production target instead of individual country ceilings. Reimposing quotas might be a long and fraught exercise since targets have political and economic significance in each country.

Iraq has been building up its production and may further increase it now that an interim agreement has been reached with the autonomous Kurdistan area for sharing the proceeds from Kurdish oil. Iraq also is unlikely to agree to production curbs as it struggles to resist Islamic State insurgents.

“The group has headed toward Vienna with the aim and hope of achieving some form of cuts but the timing and extent of the cut remains up in the air,” says Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm.

Analysts say that without quotas, any cuts may end up being meaningless. But it may be particularly difficult for the Saudis to persuade other OPEC members to agree to share in the cuts, as the country is likely to insist.

“The Saudis have not forgotten the searing experience of the 1980s,” when the country cut production on its own and lost significant share, said Bhushan Bahree, a longtime analyst of OPEC who is now at the market research firm IHS. “They do not want a repeat.”","Its Grip on Oil Weakening, OPEC Will Meet on Prices ",2014-11-26,The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna as the cartel finds it increasingly hard to influence world supply and price.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/business/its-grip-on-oil-weakening-opec-will-meet-on-prices.html

Meanwhile, Amazon’s defenders often digress into paeans to online bookselling, which has indeed been a good thing for many Americans, or testimonials to Amazon customer service — and in case you’re wondering, yes, I have Amazon Prime and use it a lot. But again, so what? The desirability of new technology, or even Amazon’s effective use of that technology, is not the issue. After all, John D. Rockefeller and his associates were pretty good at the oil business, too — but Standard Oil nonetheless had too much power, and public action to curb that power was essential.

And the same is true of Amazon today.

If you haven’t been following the recent Amazon news: Back in May a dispute between Amazon and Hachette, a major publishing house, broke out into open commercial warfare. Amazon had been demanding a larger cut of the price of Hachette books it sells; when Hachette balked, Amazon began disrupting the publisher’s sales. Hachette books weren’t banned outright from Amazon’s site, but Amazon began delaying their delivery, raising their prices, and/or steering customers to other publishers.

You might be tempted to say that this is just business — no different from Standard Oil, back in the days before it was broken up, refusing to ship oil via railroads that refused to grant it special discounts. But that is, of course, the point: The robber baron era ended when we as a nation decided that some business tactics were out of line. And the question is whether we want to go back on that decision.

Does Amazon really have robber-baron-type market power? When it comes to books, definitely. Amazon overwhelmingly dominates online book sales, with a market share comparable to Standard Oil’s share of the refined oil market when it was broken up in 1911. Even if you look at total book sales, Amazon is by far the largest player.

So far Amazon has not tried to exploit consumers. In fact, it has systematically kept prices low, to reinforce its dominance. What it has done, instead, is use its market power to put a squeeze on publishers, in effect driving down the prices it pays for books — hence the fight with Hachette. In economics jargon, Amazon is not, at least so far, acting like a monopolist, a dominant seller with the power to raise prices. Instead, it is acting as a monopsonist, a dominant buyer with the power to push prices down.

And on that front its power is really immense — in fact, even greater than the market share numbers indicate. Book sales depend crucially on buzz and word of mouth (which is why authors are often sent on grueling book tours); you buy a book because you’ve heard about it, because other people are reading it, because it’s a topic of conversation, because it’s made the best-seller list. And what Amazon possesses is the power to kill the buzz. It’s definitely possible, with some extra effort, to buy a book you’ve heard about even if Amazon doesn’t carry it — but if Amazon doesn’t carry that book, you’re much less likely to hear about it in the first place.

So can we trust Amazon not to abuse that power? The Hachette dispute has settled that question: no, we can’t.

It’s not just about the money, although that’s important: By putting the squeeze on publishers, Amazon is ultimately hurting authors and readers. But there’s also the question of undue influence.

Specifically, the penalty Amazon is imposing on Hachette books is bad in itself, but there’s also a curious selectivity in the way that penalty has been applied. Last month the Times’s Bits blog documented the case of two Hachette books receiving very different treatment. One is Daniel Schulman’s “Sons of Wichita,” a profile of the Koch brothers; the other is “The Way Forward,” by Paul Ryan, who was Mitt Romney’s running mate and is chairman of the House Budget Committee. Both are listed as eligible for Amazon Prime, and for Mr. Ryan’s book Amazon offers the usual free two-day delivery. What about “Sons of Wichita”? As of Sunday, it “usually ships in 2 to 3 weeks.” Uh-huh.

Which brings us back to the key question. Don’t tell me that Amazon is giving consumers what they want, or that it has earned its position. What matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is.",Amazon’s Monopsony Is Not O.K.,2014-10-20,"It comes down to this: Amazon has too much power, and it is abusing it.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/opinion/paul-krugman-amazons-monopsony-is-not-ok.html

290,"A turbulent week of trading ended Friday with stocks finishing lower for the third time in five days. The decline followed two days of big gains and nudged major indexes lower for the year.

A slide in oil prices deepened, stoking concerns about global economic growth. Energy stocks tumbled, extending their losses for the year. Investors also were discouraged by weak wage growth in December, despite another strong increase in hiring.

“We finally got the jobs growing,” said Erik Davidson, deputy chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank. “Now people are looking through that at the actual wage growth numbers and they want to see improvement on wages, which obviously would spur demand and consumer confidence.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index shed 17.33 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,044.81. The index is now down 0.7 percent for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 170.50 points, or about 1 percent, to 17,737.37. The Dow has fallen 0.5 percent this year. The Nasdaq lost 32.12 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,704.07. It’s down 0.7 percent this year.

After a long period of relative calm, stock markets have become more volatile as investors struggle to assess slowing global growth and slumping oil prices. A gauge of investor anxiety, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s volatility index, or Vix, rose 3 percent to 17.5 on Friday, up from 12 a month ago.

“It’s going to be a volatile year,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners. He added that he predicted a pretty good year, “if you push out this volatility and you focus on the trends.”

A combination of positive U.S. economic news, hopes for stimulus from Europe’s central bank and renewed confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep supporting the economy helped push stocks higher in the middle of the week after a tough start to the year.

But by Friday, the jobs data and a renewed decline in oil prices put traders in a selling mood once again.

U.S. crude fell 43 cents, or 0.9 percent, to close at $48.36 a barrel in New York on further evidence that OPEC will not cut production in an effort to support prices. In London, Brent crude fell 85 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $50.11 a barrel, setting a new five and a half-year low.

The price of oil has fallen by more than half since June as traders anticipate a glut of supply caused by increased production. The slide also has stoked concern about the already troubled state of economies overseas.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 17,920 17,860 Previous close 17,907.87 17,800 17,740 17,680 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

“Is it a canary in the coal mine for bigger global economic concerns?” Davidson said. “Is oil telling us something about the future of the global economy?”

The latest U.S. jobs data also gave some investors reason for concern. The government reported that employers added 252,000 jobs in December, slightly more than economists expected. The government also noted that more jobs were added in October and November than it had previously estimated.

Still, wage growth remained weak, as average hourly pay slipped 5 cents in December. And the unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in part because many of the jobless gave up looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.

291,"Global financial markets made a series of epic moves in the second half of 2014: toward a sharply lower price of oil, much lower interest rates, and a far stronger dollar.

We’re now seeing how, for better and worse, those moves will affect the American economy in 2015. A number of business and economic reports Tuesday showed the kinds of winners and losers we can expect for months to come as the impact of those market moves percolates through companies large and small.

The news was not without bright spots, but markets viewed it decidedly negatively in the aggregate, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index down 1.5 percent in morning trading. It is a reminder that for every American enjoying a cheaper tank of gas or a more affordable mortgage, there are also major employers wrestling with less investment in new oil exploration and lower earnings from abroad. And it is an object lesson in how the seemingly abstract moves in markets can affect real companies and real people.

These are the four major effects on display.

The stronger dollar is bad for U.S. multinationals.

Companies that have headquarters in the United States but bring in much of their revenue from abroad are facing a predicament: The appreciation in the dollar (and the flip side, a depreciation of most foreign currencies) means that their sales overseas are not worth as much as they used to be. The dollar index, measuring its value against six other major currencies, is up 17.7 percent since June 30.

Procter & Gamble, the giant consumer goods company, is a perfect example. In its 2014 fiscal year, 61 percent of its sales were from outside North America. And its results for the final months of the year, released Tuesday, show just how challenging the rise in the dollar will be.

Foreign exchange moves will cause the company’s earnings to fall 12 percent for its 2015 fiscal year, according to its news release, or $1.4 billion after tax.

“Virtually every currency in the world devalued versus the U.S. dollar,” the chief executive, A.G. Lafley, said in a news release. He said that the company was making progress in transforming its strategy, but that “the considerable business portfolio, product innovation and productivity progress was not enough to overcome foreign exchange.”

Procter & Gamble has company. The chemicals giant Dupont said its sales were down 5 percent in the fourth quarter, largely attributable to currency swings. And the construction equipment giant Caterpillar said its sales fell 1 percent in the quarter, also “primarily due” to a weaker yen and euro.

The oil price decline means less investment spending.

The currency shift wasn’t the only bad news for Caterpillar. The company sells much of its equipment to companies involved in oil exploration, and the drop of more than 50 percent in the price of oil since the summer means that demand for such equipment may soon dry up. It doesn’t help that most other commodity prices are down as well, including copper and iron ore, which means mining activity could suffer as well.

Caterpillar on Tuesday forecast 2015 sales of $50 billion, down from $55.2 billion in 2015.

“The recent dramatic decline in the price of oil is the most significant reason for the year-over-year decline in our sales and revenues outlook,” Doug Oberhelman, the chief executive, said in the company’s earnings release. “Current oil prices are a significant headwind for energy and transportation and negative for our construction business in the oil producing regions of the world.”

The combination of a stronger dollar and lower oil price — with resulting lower investment in oil exploration — may already be affecting the overall economic results.

Orders for durable goods fell 3.4 percent in December. That was primarily because of a fall in orders for aircraft, but orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft — a signal of future business investment — fell 0.2 percent, hardly a resounding sign of confidence from the corporate sector.

But it’s better news for energy consumers.

If you are a consumer of energy rather than a producer, the drop in oil prices is sunnier news, and that showed on Tuesday in the latest numbers from American Airlines. The company’s revenues were up slightly in the fourth quarter, while operating expenses fell, primarily because of a 17.3 percent drop in fuel cost.

That helped the company swing to a $597 million profit in the final three months of the year, compared with a $1.95 billion combined loss for its two predecessor companies, AMR Corporation and US Airways, in 2013.

And it’s not just companies benefiting from lower fuel prices. A falling price of gasoline is likely a factor in a sharp rise in consumer confidence in January. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence rose 9.8 points to 102.6, the highest since August 2007.

In effect, the big question as lower oil prices spread through the economy in 2015 is which force will prove more powerful — the benefits to consumers and businesses that use petroleum products, or the lower oil exploration activity likely to result. Most economists are betting on the former.

The bond market rally is good for home buyers.

The same forces that led to a rising dollar in recent months have meant lower long-term interest rates across the economy, including for home buyers. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage started 2014 at around 4.5 percent before ending the year at about 3.9 percent.

This may be creating a tailwind for housing activity, which was steady in 2014 but showed few signs of accelerating.

On Tuesday, the Census Bureau said that new home sales rose 11.6 percent in December, with rising prices and upward revisions to previous months. Separately, the S.&P./Case-Shiller home price index showed that home prices rose 0.7 percent in 20 major cities in November, with price rises in every city.

Eight years after the housing boom started to turn to bust, the sector may not be booming, but with the help of lower mortgage rates it is contributing to economic growth even as the strong dollar and lower energy investment pull the American economy the other way.",How 2014’s Huge Market Moves Are Affecting the Economy in 2015,2015-01-28,"For every American enjoying a cheaper tank of gas or a more affordable mortgage, there are major employers wrestling with lower earnings abroad.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/upshot/how-2014s-huge-market-moves-are-affecting-the-economy-in-2015.html

The Obama administration’s conditional grant of approval to Royal Dutch Shell to drill for oil off the coast of Alaska raises obvious concerns about the damage a major spill could cause to the fragile Arctic environment. But it is hardly a surprise. Shell acquired the lease for just over $2 billion in 2008, and, absent a very good reason, the government felt obliged to approve it.

Shell will be bound by safeguards that did not exist seven years ago. Several factors — including lawsuits and vigorous lobbying by environmental groups, widespread public dismay caused by the 2010 BP oil spill, and Shell’s ineptitude in earlier trial runs — have led the government to devise rules that are likely to make this project safer than it would have been.

Shell is seeking to drill up to six exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea about 70 miles off the North Slope. These would be shallow wells, 140 feet or so, far less than 5,000-plus feet of BP’s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico.

The company has invested about $6 billion into its offshore Alaskan exploration program, without completing a single well. Estimates of recoverable offshore Alaskan reserves, in the Chukchi and nearby Beaufort Sea, range as high as 30 billion barrels of oil, about four years’ worth of consumption in the United States.

The costs of a mistake could be very high. Arctic waters support large fish populations and extensive wildlife and help sustain native peoples. The environment is forbidding, with sea ice, high winds and stormy conditions that will make drilling difficult and any cleanup operation far more complicated than it was in the warm and relatively placid waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

In 2012, the Obama administration gave Shell a tentative go-ahead after insisting on various safeguards, including a fully tested well-capping system that could quickly contain a blowout. But what Shell hoped would be its first drilling season produced a string of mishaps: the Coast Guard found defects in the company’s containment barge, meant to hold oil in the event of a spill; one of Shell’s two drilling rigs nearly ran aground; air quality violations were discovered on both rigs; the dome meant to contain a blowout at the wellhead was “crushed like a beer can.” On New Year’s Eve, a second drilling rig ran aground the during a fierce storm in the Gulf of Alaska.

Shell corrected the problems, at least to the Interior Department’s satisfaction, and will be allowed to proceed as soon as it receives individual drilling permits and state and federal authorizations under laws protecting marine mammals and endangered species. When it does, it will have to follow some important new conditions imposed since 2012. One prohibits drilling after late September, when winter weather sets in; a second requires that two rigs be on the scene at all times in order to drill a relief well in the event of a blowout. The two-rig requirement makes very good sense but is a big added expense and has been fiercely opposed Shell and by the industry.

Meanwhile, inspired by the Shell project, the Interior Department in February proposed new standards that would govern future oil extraction in Arctic waters, including codifying the two-rig requirement and mandating even more rapid deployment of containment systems.

The Shell decision does not invite an industry free-for-all in Alaska. The George W. Bush administration proposed opening just about all of the Beaufort and Chukchi to exploration. The Obama administration has since taken so many Arctic areas previously open to drilling off the table — including proposing permanent wilderness protections for Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — that Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who leads the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, has accused the administration of a “stunning attack” on Alaska’s “sovereignty.”

Ultimately, the price of oil may have more to do with the industry’s Arctic ambitions than strong regulation. But the new rules will make it think twice.",A Narrow Opening for Arctic Oil ,2015-05-13,The Obama administration&#8217;s approval for Shell to drill for oil off the coast of Alaska is hardly a surprise.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/opinion/a-narrow-opening-for-arctic-oil.html
296,"I WAS just about to go with a column that started like this: When they write the history of the global response to climate change, 2014 could well be seen as the moment when the balance between action and denial tipped decisively toward action. That’s thanks to the convergence of four giant forces: São Paulo, Brazil, went dry; China and the United States together went green; solar panels went cheap; and Google and Apple went home.

But before I could go further, the bottom fell out of the world oil price, and the energy economist Phil Verleger wrote me, saying: “Fracking is a technological breakthrough like the introduction of the PC. Low-cost producers such as the Saudis will respond to the threat of these increased supplies by holding prices down” — hoping the price falls below the cost of fracking and knocks some of those American frackers out. In the meantime, though, he added, sustained low prices for oil and gas would “retard” efforts to sell more climate-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles that are helped by high oil prices and slow the shift to more climate-friendly electricity generation by wind and solar that is helped by high gas prices.

So I guess the lead I have to go with now is: When they write the history of the global response to climate change, 2014 surely would have been seen as the moment when the climate debate ended. Alas, though, world crude oil prices collapsed, making it less likely that the world will do what the International Energy Agency recently told us we must: keep most of the world’s proven oil and gas reserves in the ground. As the I.E.A. warned, “no more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050” — otherwise we’ll bust through the limit of a 2-degree Celsius rise in average temperature that scientists believe will unleash truly disruptive ice melt, sea level rise and weather extremes.

Technology is a cruel thing. The innovators who’ve made solar panels, wind power and batteries so efficient that they can now compete with coal and gas are the same innovators who are enabling us to extract oil and gas from places we never imagined we could go at prices we never imagined we would reach. Is a third lead sentence possible? There is. In fact, there is an amazing lead waiting to be written. It just takes the right political will. How so?

Let’s go back to my first lead. The reason I thought we were decisively tipping toward action was, in part, because of news like this from the BBC on Nov. 7 in São Paulo: “In Brazil’s biggest city, a record dry season and ever-increasing demand for water has led to a punishing drought.” When a metropolitan region of 20 million people runs dry because of destruction of its natural forests and watersheds, plus an extreme weather event scientists believe was made more intense by climate change, denialism is just not an option.

Then you have the hugely important deal that President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China struck on Nov. 12 under which the United States will reduce its carbon emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and China will peak its carbon emissions by or before 2030. China also committed to build by 2030 an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of clean power — or nearly as much new renewable energy in China as all the electrical capacity in America today. That will greatly spur innovation in clean tech and help do for solar, wind and batteries what China did for tennis shoes — really drive down global prices.

Also, last February, Google bought Nest, for $3.2 billion. Nest makes a $250 smart thermostat that can save homeowners tons of money by learning their temperature preferences and automatically managing their air-conditioners and home heating systems for the greatest efficiency. Also this year, Apple announced the development of the Apple HomeKit, which will enable customers to remotely manage their appliances and home energy systems on their iPhones. When Apple and Google start competing to make homes more energy efficient, watch out. We will likely see nonlinear improvements.

But what if Verleger is right — that just as the cost of computing dropped following the introduction of the PC, fracking technology could flood the world with cheaper and cheaper oil, making it a barrier to reducing emissions? There is one way out of this dilemma. Let’s make a hard political choice that’s a win for the climate, our country and our kids: Raise the gasoline tax.

“U.S. roads are crumbling,” said Verleger. “Infrastructure is collapsing. Our railroads are a joke.” Meantime, gasoline prices at the pump are falling toward $2.50 a gallon — which would be the lowest national average since 2009 — and consumers are rushing to buy S.U.V.’s and trucks. The “clear solution,” said Verleger, is to set a price of, say, $3.50 a gallon for gasoline in America, and then tax any price below that up to that level. Let the Europeans do their own version. “And then start spending the billions on infrastructure right now. At a tax of $1 per gallon, the U.S. could raise around $150 billion per year,” he said. “The investment multiplier would give a further kick to the U.S. economy — and might even start Europe moving.”

So there is a way to make 2014 that truly decisive year in confronting both climate and rebuilding America, but only our political leaders can write that lead.",Why 2014 Is a Big Deal,2014-12-14,This could have been the year that tipped the scales toward action on climate change.

301,"The economy ended last year on a tear, but financial markets are saying the outlook for this year is less bright.

Stocks continued to retreat from their recent record highs on Tuesday, weighed down by an ongoing plunge in the price of oil. Bonds rallied as investors bought the safest assets, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note back below 2 percent for the first time in three months.

The moves suggest that investors have little confidence the economy in the United States will continue to grow at the 5 percent annual pace reached in the final quarter of last year. As a consequence, company earnings will suffer. The reason behind the gloomy prognosis is a slowdown in growth elsewhere in world, particularly Europe.

The slump in the price of oil, which dropped well below $50 a barrel Tuesday from $107 in June, has also prompted a sharp shift in investor sentiment.

“Oil prices falling is a good thing for the economy over all,” said Randy Frederick, Managing Director of Trading and Derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “But there is a point when they fall far enough that it could potentially be a problem.”

If prices stay low, some companies in the energy industry struggle because the cost of extracting the oil will exceed its price. Not only will that cost jobs in the sector, but it will also lead to lower spending on plants and equipment.

On Tuesday, U.S. Steel said it would temporarily lay off about 750 employees from two plants that make tubular steel used in oil and gas drilling. The Pittsburgh-based company said it was making the moves in response to falling oil prices and competition from foreign companies.

Investors also got some discouraging news on the economy.

A report that orders to U.S. factories fell for a fourth straight month in November stoked investors’ concerns about growth. The Commerce Department said Tuesday factory orders dropped 0.7 percent in November after falling by the same amount in October. The weakness was due to decreases in demand for primary metals, industrial machinery and military aircraft.

In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its services index fell to 56.2 last month, down from 59.3 in November.

For some the drop in bond yields is also worrying because it signals a move toward falling prices, or deflation.

Falling prices may intuitively seem attractive, but they can have a damaging impact on a country’s growth. That’s because consumers and businesses will start to cut back their spending as they wait for prices to drop.

Lower oil prices “are adding to the fear of deflation spreading to the global economy,” said Peter Cardillio, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. “That’s what the real fear is all about.”

Bonds are rallying in part because U.S. yields, even at their current low levels, are attractive to overseas investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 1.96 percent from 2.03 percent on Monday.

The yield on the 10-year German government bond, by contrast, is just 0.44 percent, and France’s 10-year bond yields 0.74 percent. The comparable Japanese government bond yields 0.28 percent.

Bonds yields in Europe have plummeted as growth in that region has wavered and investors have started to worry that Greece might seek to renegotiate the terms of its bailout and exit the euro bloc if an anti-austerity party wins national elections this month.

Financial stocks fell the most among the 10 industry sectors in the S.&P. 500 index on Tuesday. Weaker growth would mean less demand for loans, and lower interest rates mean that the profits banks make on loans will be lower.

Among individual stocks, Michael Kors was the biggest loser in the S.&P. 500.

The stock slumped $6.13, or 8.4 percent, to $66.87 after analysts at Credit Suisse cut their price target on the company’s stock to $79 from $103 following what they described as a “dramatic” increase in promotional activity at the luxury retailer, suggesting that it is struggling to maintain growth rates.

AOL was one of the stocks to buck the downward trend. The stock climbed $1.51, or 3.4 percent, to $46.25 after Bloomberg reported that Verizon had approached the company about a potential acquisition or joint venture to expand its mobile video offerings. Verizon gained 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $47.04.

In metals trading, precious metals futures mostly rose. Gold increased $15.40 to $1,219.40 an ounce, silver rose 42 cents to $16.64 an ounce and copper was flat at $2.77 a pound.

In other energy trading, Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell $2.01 to close at $51.10 in London.

302,"The legislature will also consider a bill that would give oil-producing counties in the west a greater share of future oil revenues.

But some lawmakers here worry that the surge bill goes beyond what the state can afford during a time when oil revenues are drastically falling. A joint legislative committee released a revised revenue forecast in January, predicting that oil and gas tax revenues would drop to roughly $4 billion over the next two years. Last December, budget forecasters had predicted the number would be closer to $8 billion.

“This bill is too rich for me,” Senator Dwight Cook, a Republican from Mandan, a suburb of Bismarck in central North Dakota, said on the Senate floor before voting against it. (The bill passed the Senate and is now under consideration in the House.)

Supporters of the bill say that the money has already been put aside in a special fund and deserves to go to oil-producing counties, whose leaders say their jails are crammed, their road projects underfunded, their judges overwhelmed and their schools in need of expansion.

“We need the money,” said Senator Kelly Armstrong, a Republican and one of the bill’s sponsors, adding that he had yet to scale back the bill despite worries about the economy.

“I know there are people who, with the falling price of oil, are more concerned about it,” he said. “This low price could last. I think we need to budget out conservatively, but we’re prepared to weather it.”

Other measures that had gained popularity last year, while the price of oil was still high and lawmakers were not in session, seem to be faltering.

Last year, there was considerable support for proposals that would cut the income tax and corporate tax. Several lawmakers said they now believed those bills would be voted down.

In interviews, lawmakers said they viewed the drop in oil prices as a correction rather than an impending bust. The state has played it safe for years, stashing surplus money in funds that could be used when revenues slowed down, said Al Carlson, the House majority leader.

“Structurally, we’re in pretty good shape,” he said. “We’re still going to collect over $4 billion in oil revenue from 2015 to 2017,” he said. “That’s a lot of money. It’s less than we collected last time, but it’s a lot of money.”

The great worry is that the slowdown might continue with no end in sight, Mr. Carlson said. “The concern that always comes is not these next two years,” he said. “It’s the two years after that.”

Senator Karen K. Krebsbach, Republican of Minot, said she was resisting the general feeling of “doom and gloom.” “We’re not going to close the doors and close up because oil’s down,” she said.

North Dakota was one of the few states to survive the recession with hardly a bruise. It has been lifted by oil revenues for years, but it also prides itself on its fiscal responsibility: Less than 5 percent of the state’s general fund, which is used to pay for the state’s day-to-day operations, comes directly from oil revenues. Its unemployment rate is currently 2.8 percent, the lowest in the nation.

Lawmakers said it was too early for many North Dakotans to be feeling the effects of low oil prices — indeed, many of them were relieved that gasoline prices had fallen so sharply. In Bismarck last week, a gallon of gas cost $2.15.

“For consumers, they love it when the price of gas goes below $2,” said Senator Carolyn Nelson, a Democrat. “But they don’t like it when the price of oil is way down and we don’t have the revenues they’re used to.”

But there are signs that some of the workers who have flocked to North Dakota, lured by steady jobs and the promise of overtime, are already fleeing the state. From 2010 to 2014, North Dakota’s population rose 10 percent to about 740,000, much of it because of the oil boom.

“What we hear is people saying, ‘I came to North Dakota to work because I could get 60 or 70 hours a week doing this great job,’ ” Gov. Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, said in an interview. “And now they’re disappointed because their employer has cut them back to 40 hours a week. We do hear some of them talking about moving back where they came from.”

Mr. Dalrymple said that oil companies have said they are not pulling out of North Dakota, but they have scaled back production. In late 2014, there were 193 oil rigs in production; now there are 140.

He is still waiting for another revenue forecast in mid-March, a report from Moody’s Analytics.

“There’s still plenty of denial out there, too,” he said. “Some people are still saying, ‘Oh, it’s just a little spike down, and it’s going to snap right back any day now, and we shouldn’t pay much attention to it.’ Then you have the opposite end of the spectrum, where people are saying, ‘It’s going to get bad and be bad.’ We’re just trying to find the truth in it.”","As Oil Prices Slip, North Dakota Struggles to Get a Firm Grip on Its Budget",2015-02-16,"The legislature meets only once every two years, so lawmakers must plan a two-year state budget while anticipating how far the price of oil may drop.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/us/as-oil-prices-slip-north-dakota-struggles-to-get-a-grip-on-its-budget.html

JAKARTA, Indonesia — Responding to the first major policy move of Indonesia’s new president, which sent gasoline prices up 30 percent on Tuesday, the country’s central bank held an unscheduled meeting and increased its benchmark interest rate in an effort to combat inflation.

Gasoline stations across the sprawling Indonesian archipelago displayed higher prices at the pump on Tuesday, the morning after President Joko Widodo, who took office last month, announced an increase in the price of subsidized gasoline.

While the subsidy is popular with voters and lawmakers, it costs Indonesia more than $20 billion a year. Mr. Joko contends that money needs to go toward more productive uses.

Higher gasoline prices in this country of 250 million, however, usually set off increases in the price of many other items, including food, clothing and transportation. That further burdens the 100 million Indonesians who live on $2 a day or less.

The price of subsidized gasoline rose Tuesday morning to 8,500 rupiah, or 70 cents, a liter, from 6,500 rupiah, or 53 cents, an increase of 31 percent. The price of diesel was raised to 7,500 rupiah from 5,500 rupiah.

After a long meeting of the country’s central bank, Bank Indonesia, its governor, Agus Martowardojo, announced its first interest rate increase in a year. The lending rate was raised a quarter percentage point, to 7.75 percent, and the lending facility rate by half a percentage point, to 8 percent.

Mr. Agus said the rate increase was meant to keep inflationary pressures under control and said the bank’s aim was to keep inflation at about 4 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, in 2015.

“Bank Indonesia welcomes the government’s fiscal reform policy,” Mr. Agus said, “in order to reallocate the fuel subsidy budget to productive sectors.”

Benedict Bingham, the International Monetary Fund’s resident representative for Indonesia, said the bank’s move sent a strong signal on inflation, while also affirming its priorities. The bank is showing, he said, “that it still sees macroeconomic stability as the main priority given the potential risks in the global economic outlook.”

Indonesia’s annual economic growth has plummeted to an estimated 5.2 percent for this year, from 6.5 percent in 2012.

Fauzi Ichsan, chief economist and head of government relations at Standard Chartered in Jakarta, said he estimated that inflation in Indonesia would balloon to more than 7 percent, from the current 4.8 percent, by next month because of the fuel price increase, but that the surge would be temporary.

“Both the Indonesian government and Bank Indonesia have done the right things,” Mr. Fauzi said. “It’s not crucial that the central bank did the rate hike, but they did it to send the right signal to markets that they are ahead of the curve and are handling expectations on inflation.”

Mr. Joko, despite having swept into office on populist policies, has argued that Indonesia needs to channel the tens of billions of dollars it spends annually on the gas subsidies, which give its citizens some of the cheapest gasoline in the world, toward infrastructure projects like roads and ports; developing agriculture and fisheries, which employ the majority of Indonesians; and social service programs like health care.

According to the World Bank, the subsidy benefited the wealthy more than the poor. And the $20 billion spent each year is more than the country spends on health care and other social services.

The Indonesian government expects to save up to $11.5 billion next year by reducing fuel subsidies, Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro told Reuters, adding that the move would free up money for infrastructure and other projects.

Nonetheless, thousands of Indonesians took to Twitter on Tuesday to criticize Mr. Joko and the World Bank. Some student groups and the National Road Transportation Operators Association told local news media that they planned to organize protests against Mr. Joko’s decision.

Mr. Joko has suggested continually raising the price of gasoline over a four-year period. Even his opponent in the presidential election, Prabowo Subianto, a former army general, agreed that the fuel subsidy was economically unsustainable.

The previous president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, tried raising fuel prices in 2012, prompting an embarrassing revolt among members of his own governing coalition. The plan was quashed in a raucous budget session of Parliament as student and labor groups outside clashed with riot police on live national television.

Last year, however, Mr. Yudhoyono’s government was able to push through an amended budget that raised fuel prices to 53 cents a liter, from 37 cents.",Indonesia’s Central Bank Raises Benchmark Interest Rate as Gas Prices Jump,2014-11-19,The new president’s first major policy move prompted an immediate response from Bank Indonesia to fend off an expected spike in inflation.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/business/international/indonesias-central-bank-raises-benchmark-interest-rate-as-gas-prices-jump.html

Oil fell below $68 a barrel a day after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided not to cut output, which could leave markets oversupplied. The 7 percent decline was the biggest one-day drop since May 2011, with prices lowest since 2010.

The January crude oil contract settled at $66.15, down $7.54 from Wednesday.

Oil weakness helped airline stocks. Southwest Airlines rose 6.47 percent, to $41.82, and Delta Air Lines gained 5.49 percent, to $46.67.

Retailers rallied as lower gas prices could increase consumer spending. Wal-Mart Stores rose 3 percent, to $87.54, while the S.&P. 500 retailing index was up 1.4 percent.

“This low should be very additive to economic activity, not just with gas prices but across the economy,” said Mr. Roth, who oversees $80 billion in assets. “Early holiday shopping numbers should come in pretty strong.”

The dollar mostly strengthened after the OPEC decision on oil output. Eurozone government bond yields held near record lows as declining energy prices cut into consumer price growth across the bloc and raised the chances of more stimulus from the European Central Bank on increased deflation fears.

The drop in oil led to a sharp decline in inflation expectations as measured by breakevens, with 10-year TIPS at their lowest since October 2011 at about 1.8 percent.

LONDON — The financial impact of the sharp fall in oil prices has begun to show in the earnings of big energy companies.

Royal Dutch Shell, the first big player to post financial results since the steep decline in oil prices, said on Thursday that earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 had actually risen from a year earlier, as improved performance in marketing and refining offset the effects of lower oil prices.

But the results were weaker than analysts had expected. A main culprit was that average oil prices in the quarter tumbled to about $72 a barrel, from about $95 a barrel.

Shell’s shares were down more than 4 percent in London on Thursday.

The financial picture for the sector should become clearer in coming days, as other major energy companies report results for the last quarter of 2014, which began with oil at about $95 a barrel but ended at about $55. On Thursday, the international benchmark, Brent crude, was trading at about $49 a barrel.

Shell is responding cautiously, saying that its capital spending in 2015 will most likely be similar to the $35 billion it spent in 2014. Capital expenditure in the industry has been soaring in recent years.

Ben van Beurden, the chief executive, said, “It is very important not to get into a slash-and-burn mentality,” adding that Shell would take “a very measured approach.”

He also said that Shell projected a price range of $70 to $90 a barrel in the long term, and estimated that higher oil prices are required if the industry is to invest in the future.

Shell’s decision not to make deep cuts in spending disappointed some analysts, but others applauded the company.

“What we like is that Shell is not overreacting with respect to the oil price,” analysts at Bernstein Research in London wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. “Implied in that is that prices will recover.”

After reviewing its plans, Shell deferred some projects and canceled others, Mr. van Beurden said. The decisions will lead to reducing spending on projects by $15 billion over the next three years from what the company might have spent.

The unexpected drop in crude prices has put into question the viability of projects across the industry. Some companies are cutting exploration and production budgets and halting projects, and producers in the United States are cutting the number of drilling rigs around the country.

Shell, which is based in The Hague, said that earnings excluding one-time items and inventory changes rose about 12 percent, to $3.3 billion, from $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income declined 57 percent, to $773 million, on revenue of $92 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings in 2014 were $22.6 billion, up 16 percent from the previous year.

Analysts at Liberum Capital in London said in a note to clients on Thursday that the results were “disappointing, 20 percent below consensus.”

The results reflect the efforts to cut costs and to increase efficiency put in place by Mr. van Beurden, who took over as chief at the beginning of 2014. He has been trying to improve on the lackluster results of previous years by closing and selling ailing businesses and by streamlining operations.

Though Shell is trying to restrain capital spending, it is still intent on drilling for oil in Alaska, which the company considers its best prospect. Mr. van Beurden said the company hoped to drill this summer in the Chukchi Sea, if the company receives​ the necessary permits and overcomes legal challenges. ​

Shell’s plans to drill in Alaska were delayed after a series of accidents and other problems in 2013 and after a United States court ruling a year ago said that the Department of the Interior had awarded offshore leases in the Chukchi Sea to Shell and other companies in 2008 without fully considering the environmental risks.

​Mr. van Beurden said Shell had already prepared a large amount of equipment for the operation, which has already cost the company $5 billion.

It is likely to cost Shell $1 billion more if the company is authorized to drill in Alaska, and close to $1 billion even if it does not. Drilling in Alaska is “a little like operating the North Sea from New York,” ​Mr. van Beurden said.

The effects of slumping oil prices were offset in the fourth quarter by the performance of its oil refining, chemicals and marketing businesses, which showed particular improvement with earnings up about $1 billion, or 178 percent, to $1.56 billion.

“Our strategy is delivering, but we’re not complacent,” Mr. van Beurden said in a statement. “Weaker oil prices underline that there’s a lot more to do.”

Performance in core exploration and production was less vigorous, with earnings falling 30 percent to $1.7 billion. Much of the drop can most likely be attributed to lower oil and gas prices, but big losses in the Americas and Oceania, which includes Australia, also hurt.

Shell says a $10 drop in the price of a barrel of oil translates into $3.3 billion in lower earnings on an annual basis.

The company also said that it had replaced only 26 percent of the oil and gas it produced in 2014.

Mr. van Beurden showed reporters a slide that indicated that the company, while improving in terms of generating cash, was still being outperformed by competitors in terms of returns on capital.

Shell, which sold $2.2 billion in exploration and production assets in the fourth quarter as it trimmed positions in shale gas in the United States, said a strategic review of its global portfolio was now underway. That could lead to further divestments and write-offs.",Royal Dutch Shell Posts Rise in Earnings Despite Lower Oil Prices,2015-01-30,"Better performance in refining, chemicals and marketing offset the effects of lower oil prices, but the results were weaker than analysts had expected.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-q4-earnings.html

WHILE the ire of environmental activists remains fixed on the Keystone XL pipeline, a potentially greater threat looms in the proposed expansion of Line 61, a pipeline running the length of Wisconsin carrying tar sands crude. The pipeline is owned by Enbridge, a $40 billion Canadian company, which has been responsible for several hundred spills in the past decade, including one in 2010 near Marshall, Mich., reportedly the largest and most expensive inland oil spill in American history.

Enbridge is seeking to increase Line 61’s capacity threefold, making it a third larger than the projected Keystone XL. The last real line of defense against this expansion is an obscure zoning committee in Dane County, Wis., which is scheduled to meet on Jan. 27 to decide whether to attach conditions to Enbridge’s permit for a new pump station. Voting to do so would risk a lawsuit from Enbridge, which maintains that the county has no legal right to impose such conditions.

While the fight over Keystone XL has involved millions of dollars in advertising, the arrests of many activists outside the White House and the direct engagement of President Obama, Enbridge’s plans have received little national attention. This is a glaring example of how environmental policy with transnational impacts can be pushed at the state level without attracting great scrutiny.

Line 61, built in 2007, moves 400,000 barrels of tar sands and lighter conventional crude oil a day from Superior, Wis., in the state’s far north, to refineries in Metropolitan Chicago or, through a network of connecting pipelines, to the Gulf Coast. Enbridge wants to increase that, in stages, to 1.2 million barrels per day.

Despite this enormous change in capacity, Wisconsin’s Department of Natural Resources has mandated just a single public hearing. That hearing, held last year, was for an air quality permit and was devoted solely to the impact of constructing storage tanks in Superior. The D.N.R. maintains that a 2006 environmental assessment addresses concerns over the safety of Line 61’s expansion.

That analysis took place four years before Enbridge’s largest spill, in July 2010, which flooded the Kalamazoo River near Marshall with more than 840,000 gallons of tar sands crude and cost the company $1.2 billion to clean up. The cost exceeded the cap on Enbridge’s liability insurance by nearly $600 million. (The company paid the difference.)

The Marshall spill demonstrated how much more destructive tar sands crude spills are compared with spills of lighter crude. To move through a pipeline, tar sands ore needs to be mixed with chemical solvents. When the spilled mixture was exposed to air, the chemical components, including carcinogenic benzene, separated and released toxic gases, which forced many people to evacuate their homes. Meanwhile, the heavier tar sands sank, which required a destructive dredging of the Kalamazoo River.

Although Enbridge completed the cleanup effort last summer, the Environmental Protection Agency asserts that oil remains in the Kalamazoo River. In a scathing 2012 assessment of the Marshall spill, the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency tasked with investigating pipeline accidents, detailed unconscionable lapses in Enbridge’s response.

Line 61’s opponents are focused on Enbridge’s need for new pump stations, which require a conditional use permit from many of the counties in which they are built. Enbridge has secured these permits from each of these counties except Dane.

At the meeting on Jan. 27, Dane County’s five-member Zoning and Land Regulation Committee is scheduled to vote on Enbridge’s permit. The committee is considering whether to require Enbridge to carry a more comprehensive — and expensive — kind of liability insurance than it had during the Marshall spill. While county governments cannot override federal or state law, there is some precedent for attaching financial requirements to permits.

Opponents believe that if Enbridge is forced to buy insurance to cover a Marshall-size spill, the price of expansion could become too onerous. In November, however, three lawyers representing Enbridge met privately with a few county officials, including Patrick Miles, the chairman of Dane County’s zoning committee, and presented a white paper outlining the company’s position that the county does not have the legal right to attach insurance requirements to its permit. Mr. Miles said the implication was clear: The company would sue if need be.

Since the Marshall spill, the company has built a new command center in Edmonton and invested $4 billion dollars in maintenance, emergency response and other safety improvements. Despite all this, 4,000 gallons of tar sands crude spilled last January from the Alberta Clipper, the pipeline feeding Line 61.

Even with the dropping price of oil, Enbridge remains committed to Line 61’s expansion. Local officials like Mr. Miles have limited legal and financial means to challenge companies such as Enbridge. A more effective approach would be a policy, coordinated between the governments of Canada and the United States, that assessed the cumulative effects of new pipelines and tar sands production on the environment. But given the current political climate, such an agreement is unlikely anytime soon.

Dane County’s principled concerns over Line 61’s expansion suggest an alternative, if imperfect, model. If a majority of the committee votes to attach conditions to the county’s permit, and they prevail in any court battle, their victory would provide an important precedent to local governments across the country. Even if they lose, they will have helped raise public awareness about the high costs, both local and planetary, endemic to tar sands crude.",The Other Pipeline You Should Worry About,2015-01-17,"In all the talk about Keystone XL, we&#8217;re overlooking Line 61.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/opinion/its-not-just-keystone-xl-its-also-line-61.html

Apollo Global Management is sprinting to raise a new fund to buy the debt of troubled energy companies, as the private equity giant seeks to capitalize on the recent collapse in oil prices.

The new vehicle, known as Energy Credit Opportunity Fund, is aiming to raise the capital on an unusually compressed timeline, according to a confidential email obtained by DealBook. Apollo is hoping to hold an initial closing for the fund in early March and then finish raising the capital by early April.

Apollo, a firm that specializes in buying distressed debt at bargain prices, sometimes investing vast sums in companies that others won’t touch, is hoping to use that approach to a greater degree in the oil and gas industry, which has come under intense pressure since oil prices peaked last June. But time is of the essence.

“We expect to have a very short time frame for fund-raising given the volatile market environment,” Apollo said in the email.

The shake-up in the energy sector has hurt a number of companies backed by private equity. The Carlyle Group, an Apollo rival based in Washington, reported that a group of its energy funds fell 17 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.

But private equity firms are also trying to find opportunities in the chaos. The Blackstone Group, the industry’s biggest player, has been raising a new energy fund that is expected to exceed $4 billion in assets. Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone’s chief, said in December that energy was “one of the best opportunities we’ve had in many, many years.”

Apollo has been busy investing through an $18.4 billion private equity fund that it finished raising last year. But the new credit fund is intended to provide a specialized focus on debt.

To court investors, Apollo plans to hold a due diligence session on Monday at its Manhattan headquarters to talk about the oil price decline and discuss potential investment opportunities, the email said. The three-and-a-half-hour session, including a breakfast, will feature presentations by James Zelter, the managing director of Apollo’s credit business.

The dollar amount Apollo is hoping to raise for the fund could not immediately be determined.

LONDON — Chevron and BP said on Wednesday that they would work together to explore, appraise and, possibly, develop 24 offshore leases in a deepwater part of the Gulf of Mexico known as the lower tertiary.

Also known as the Paleogene, the geological zone has in recent years been considered a new frontier. But because it is deeper under the seabed than previously worked areas, the oil there tends to be hotter and under more pressure and thus more difficult and costly to bring to market.

BP also said it would sell to Chevron large stakes in two key discoveries, called Tiber and Gila, in the area. In what seems to be a major concession by BP, Chevron will operate these fields along with an exploration area called Gibson.

ConocoPhillips also has large stakes in the oil fields falling under the joint venture, which is in a region of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico about 180 miles south of the United States coast.

The new arrangement between Chevron and BP, analysts said, highlighted the pressure on the companies to hold down spending and share risk as oil prices have fallen about 60 percent since June.

“The industry will have to hunker down,” said Fadel Gheit, an analyst in New York with Oppenheimer & Company.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Mr. Gheit said the decision by BP to let Chevron operate or manage Tiber and Gila reflected fallout from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout that killed 11 people and spilled millions of barrels of oil in the gulf. BP has sold assets worldwide to raise money to pay for damage from the spill and its production in the Gulf of Mexico has dropped.

""BP is significantly more experienced than Chevron in the Gulf of Mexico,” Mr. Gheit said. But BP “wants to keep a low profile” to put “the oil spill behind them,” he said.

Chevron has been picking up momentum in the Gulf of Mexico. Late last year, the company began production at another pair of deepwater fields, Jack and St. Malo, which were jointly developed to hold down costs.

At 35,000 feet, the exploration well that discovered Tiber in 2009 was one of the deepest ever drilled. BP has never given estimates for the reserves. Its straitened financial circumstances had raised questions about if and when it would be developed.

As with Jack and St. Malo, the oil companies in the new venture hope eventually to use a joint facility to process the oil from these fields, which are relatively close together, Chevron said in a statement. The company also said it planned to work with its partners “to realize cost savings and optimize the use of human resources.”

BP plans to sell about half of its stake in Tiber and Gila to Chevron for an undisclosed price. BP said all three companies would have similar working interests in any future centralized processing facility.

In a statement, Richard Morrison, president of BP’s Gulf of Mexico business, said that letting Chevron operate the new fields would allow BP to “increase our focus on maximizing production” from other fields.",Chevron and BP in Deal to Search for Oil Deep Beneath the Gulf of Mexico,2015-01-29,The joint effort is a reflection of the pressure on oil companies to hold down spending and share risk as oil prices continue to drop.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/business/energy-environment/chevron-and-bp-in-deal-to-search-for-oil-deep-beneath-the-gulf-of-mexico.html
316,"Greg Rickford, Canada’s minister of natural resources, was in the United States most of this past week, on a trip that didn’t get much attention in the media with so much bigger news swirling about. So let me fill you in.

Rickford spent the first two days of his trip in Washington, where of course debate over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline is underway in earnest in the new Republican-led Senate. The Republican-led House, meanwhile, has already passed a bill giving the go-ahead to the pipeline, which, if it’s ever built, will transport heavy crude from the tar sands of Alberta to American refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. And of course President Obama has threatened to veto any such bill, should one land on his desk.

In Washington, Rickford met with his Obama administration counterpart, Ernest Moniz, the secretary of energy. Although the Keystone pipeline was not on the agenda, the two men talked about it anyway. Rickford paid a visit to Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota, who strongly supports the Keystone pipeline. (In addition to the Alberta crude, the pipeline would transport shale oil from North Dakota.)

He met with State Department officials to get a Keystone update; because the pipeline would cross the U.S.-Canada border, the department has to do a review, which it has done several times, always coming down in favor of the project. In several speeches, Rickford talked up the close energy relationship between the United States and Canada, noting that Canada sends three million barrels per day to America — more than Venezuela and Saudi Arabia combined. He mentioned Canada’s new pipeline safety law. He said he thought the Keystone XL pipeline should be approved, which is essentially what Canadian officials have been saying for the past six years.

Then on Wednesday, Rickford went to Texas for two days. This is the part of his trip that really caught my attention. His main focus in Texas was on two new Canadian-controlled pipelines that became operational in mid-December. One is called the Flanagan South pipeline, which cost $2.8 billion. It covers nearly 600 miles, from Pontiac, Ill., to Cushing, Okla. The other pipeline, called the Seaway Twin, runs an additional 500 miles, from Cushing to Freeport, Tex., where the refineries are. It cost $1.2 billion. Guess where some of the oil that is going to run through those pipelines is coming from? Yep — the tar sands of Alberta.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

If you are wondering why the environmental community hasn’t been chaining itself to the White House fence to protest these two new pipelines, the way it has with Keystone, the answer is that neither of these pipelines crosses the Canadian border, so they don’t require the same complicated approval process that Keystone requires. (The Flanagan South line will connect with a pipeline that already crosses the border.) More to the point, perhaps, they were never the symbol that the high-profile Keystone XL became, so that even the approvals they did require never aroused the same attention from environmentalists.

Yet these new pipelines are going to be carrying some 200,000 barrels per day of the heavy crude mined from the tar sands. True, that is only a third of what the Keystone XL would be able to deliver, but it essentially helps double the amount of tar sands oil that can be exported to the United States. In addition, there will be expanded rail capacity for Alberta’s oil, which is a far more dangerous way to move it than a state-of-the-art pipeline.

The point is: With or without Keystone, Canada’s tar sands oil is coming to the United States. One of the stated reasons that environmental activists wanted to prevent Keystone from being built was that doing so would force Canada to stop mining the oil. Without Keystone, it was said, Canada would have no means to export it. But that has never been a particularly plausible argument. Even before the opening of these two new pipelines, tar sands oil was coming to the United States, primarily by rail. Indeed, the only thing that can slow it down now is the rapid drop in the price of oil, which is likely to make expensive tar sands crude unprofitable.

Even as the Keystone debate reaches its current crescendo, all that is left, really, is the symbolism. The Republican right claims that Keystone will create jobs. It won’t, not to any significant degree. The Democratic left says that the oil Keystone will bring to the Gulf is so dirty, so carbon laden, that it will wreak havoc on the climate. It won’t do that either. If the president ultimately decides not to approve Keystone, he will do so knowing full well that he has not stopped the tar sands oil in any meaningful way.

To expect another outcome is, well, a pipe dream. It always was.",The Keystone XL Illusion,2015-01-17,"With or without the pipeline, Canada&#8217;s tar sands oil is coming to the United States.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/opinion/joe-nocera-the-keystone-xl-illusion.html
317,"LONDON — Total, the Paris-based oil giant, on Thursday reported a loss of $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 as it struggles with the deep slump in oil prices.

Write-downs of about $6.5 billion, mostly on Canadian oil sands projects, shale gas operations in the United States and European refining businesses, contributed to the loss, the company said.

With oil prices’ having slumped sharply since June, Total's chief executive, Patrick Pouyanné, finds himself, as other oil company leaders are, trying to pare costs without hurting the company’s long-term outlook.

“We have to react but not overreact,” he told reporters in London on Thursday. Mr. Pouyanné became chief last year after the death of Christophe de Margerie, whose private jet hit a snowplow in Moscow.

Mr. Pouyanné implied that oil prices would eventually recover ground. He said that high-cost oil from shale deposits, tar sands and other projects that cost around $90 a barrel to develop would eventually be needed to supply growing global demand and to make up for the natural decline in oil fields. There is fundamental support for high long-term prices, he said.

Total will impose a hiring freeze, leading to the reduction of 2,000 jobs by the end of this year through attrition. Mr. Pouyanné said that the company did not want to lay skilled people off and waste the time and money it had put into their training.

Net income adjusted for inventory changes and one-offs, a measure closely watched by industry analysts, fell 17 percent in the quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, to $2.8 billion. For the year, adjusted net income fell 10 percent to $12.8 billion on revenue of $236 billion.

While quarterly adjusted earnings beat analysts’ expectations, the performance of the company’s core exploration and production division fell 48 percent. Total’s stock price was up about 1 percent.

Oil prices have plunged roughly 50 percent since the summer, amid a glut of supply and slowing demand. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was trading around $56 a barrel on Thursday, well below the level of about $110 a barrel in June.

Oil companies are now finding that their investments are either not viable or not worth as much as they had estimated when oil prices were higher. Other companies, like BP and Tullow, an explorer based in Britain, have taken write-downs in the fourth quarter. Analysts say that many other companies will need to follow suit.

Mr. Pouyanné established a reputation for cutting costs in his previous role as head of Total’s marketing and refining operations, having negotiated the closing of some plants with European unions. Pressured by the drop in oil prices, he is trying to broaden cost-cutting to the rest of the company, including the core exploration and production unit.

Total also said that it would trim investment to $23 billion from $26.4 billion, partly by stopping projects that have become less profitable. It said it would accelerate the sale of some assets, echoing plans announced by other companies.

Total also said it would continue to address the issue of too much capacity in Europe by shutting down some parts of its Lindsey refinery in Britain with the loss of about 180 jobs. The company said a new plan for its refineries in France would be presented in the spring.

Despite the loss, analysts at Bernstein Research in London told clients on Thursday that they “like the company’s response” to low prices. The Bernstein analysts said that Total had the best performance of the major oil companies on its return on capital, at 11.1 percent for 2014.

HOUSTON — Exxon Mobil on Monday reported a sharp drop in fourth-quarter revenue and profit because of declining oil prices. But the company did better than many of its competitors, thanks to improved profit margins at its chemical business.

The deep earnings decline for Exxon, the largest American oil and gas producer, was expected; net income fell to $6.57 billion from $8.35 billion in the same quarter last year. Executives blamed lower commodity prices, but there were other troubling signs, especially the company’s decline in oil and gas production of 3.8 percent during the quarter.

Both profit and revenue of $87.3 billion were down 21 percent from the year earlier.

The results were bolstered by profits from asset sales, a successful arbitration settlement from a past nationalization by Venezuela and other one-time special items. The company said it was cutting its quarterly share buybacks to $1 billion, from $3 billion, and while it did not give explicit new guidance on its investment plans for the year, it was clear that it was trying to cut costs.

“We’re probably in the early innings of this effort,” Jeffrey J. Woodbury, Exxon’s vice president for investor relations, said in a conference call. “More is to come in that area,” he added, referring not only to declining rig counts but also to rig rental rates and other service costs.

The company’s shares ended the day’s trading 2.5 percent higher at $89.58, outpacing the gain in the overall market.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell more than a third to an average of under $80 a barrel in the final three months of 2014. Oil prices plummeted further in January, raising the likelihood that earnings for Exxon and other oil companies would deteriorate more in the current first quarter.

Oil prices have surged more than 10 percent in recent days, but most experts doubt they will recover in a sustainable way until the second half of the year, at the earliest.

“Unless oil prices recover meaningfully this year, energy stocks, including Exxon, are expensive despite the correction in the last six months,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Exxon tried to put a positive face on the results. It reported positive results from its drilling in Argentina, as well as an expansion of its development plans in West Africa and off the North Atlantic coast of Canada. But Exxon has also suffered from the continuing crisis in Ukraine and western sanctions on Russia, forcing the company to suspend work with the Russian company Rosneft on exploration in the Arctic.

“Exxon Mobil’s results illustrate the value of our proven business model that integrates upstream, downstream and chemical businesses,” Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Our balanced portfolio uniquely positions Exxon Mobil to deliver superior results throughout the commodity price cycle.”

Fourth-quarter earnings from upstream production were $5.5 billion, down $1.3 billion from the previous year. Its earnings from United States production operations far exceeded those abroad, with American production earnings up $317 million for the quarter compared with those overseas, which were down $1.6 billion from the previous year.

On the positive side, the company reported that its chemical business earnings were $1.2 billion, $317 million higher than the year before, in large part because of lower natural gas prices that serve as a feedstock.

The company noted that most of its reduction in oil production came from the expiration of a concession in Abu Dhabi.",Exxon Mobil Revenue and Profit Off 21% on Oil Decline ,2015-02-03,The company said its fourth-quarter results were bolstered somewhat by asset sales and improved profits in its chemical business.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-q4-earnings-decline.html

A solid report on American manufacturers and some merger news helped jolt markets higher after the open, but the gains evaporated after an hour as crude prices fell. The oil slump is worrying investors because it hammers the profits of drillers and other oil companies that are big components in stock indexes. Investors also fear it may signal the global economic slowdown is deeper than expected.

Crude oil for February delivery fell $1.82, or 3.2 percent, to settle at $56.26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil was as high as $107 in June.

The ruble sank more than 10 percent to about 64 to the dollar. The drop in crude prices has hurt Russia since the country is a major oil exporter and depends heavily on oil for tax revenue.

Several commentators have noted that plunging oil prices could eventually help American stocks because it pushes down gasoline prices, freeing up money for Americans to spend at stores.

The takeover of Iraq’s second-largest city, Mosul, on Tuesday by Sunni militants who crossed the border from Syria added to the uncertainties as OPEC oil ministers assembled on Wednesday in Vienna.

The unrest made it all the more crucial that the cartel’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, signal that it would continue to play a stabilizing role in the oil market and that current quotas and prices were satisfactory to the country, the biggest producer of OPEC’s 12 members.

“Supply is good; demand is good; the price is good,” the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told reporters before the meeting.

Prices for Brent crude, an oil benchmark, rose about 40 cents a barrel to about $110 in trading on Wednesday.

The Persian Gulf states have so far largely weathered the turmoil in the Middle East and are producing oil unhindered. That is in contrast, though, to a range of problems curbing production in several OPEC states.

The worst off is Libya, where militias are holding oil production for ransom and are practically cutting off oil exports.

Nigerian production is plagued by several ills, ranging from political turbulence to theft.

Iraq had been increasing output rapidly and has surpassed Iran, whose industry is hobbled by sanctions, to become the second-largest OPEC producer after Saudi Arabia. But Iraq is now something of a question mark given the recent wave of violence in the country, in which the government has lost control of Mosul as well as facilities in Baiji, the important refining town about 100 miles south of Mosul, to Sunni Muslim fighters.

Although the fighting in Iraq is not near the main oil-producing areas in the south of the country, the concern in the markets is that the growing disorder will spread, eventually threatening oil exports. The instability may also slow or reverse Iraq’s output growth by discouraging investment.

Production in the northern part of the country, which accounts for a small part of Iraqi output, would also most likely be reduced if the Baiji refinery was shut down, according to Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London research firm.

Those problems were a reason that market conditions were quite different from those that OPEC members faced in their last few meetings.

For a couple of years, the talk among analysts and traders had been about an oversupply of oil, production increases in the United States and, as a result, the weakening of OPEC.

But because of the political unrest’s curbing output in several countries, the focus is once again on Saudi Arabia and by how much it might need to increase supplies.

“Speculation that the market may need significantly more oil from Saudi Arabia is a complete turnaround from the last few meetings, where all the talk was of a looming glut,” Seth M. Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in London, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

To make up for shortfalls from countries like Iran and Libya, Saudi Arabia is likely to bolster production this summer to well over 10 million barrels a day, from 9.7 million barrels a day in May, according to Bhushan Bahree, an analyst at IHS Energy, who was observing the meeting.

Under the informal leadership of Mr. Naimi, the organization no longer assigns output quotas to individual countries, instead maintaining the loose output target of 30 million barrels a day.

Mr. Bahree noted that a Saudi increase to more than 10 million barrels a day would erode its closely watched buffer of unused or spare capacity to razor-thin margins of around two million barrels a day. The country says it can produce up to 12.5 million barrels a day in extreme circumstances.

“This leaves spare capacity in a precarious condition,” Mr. Bahree said, adding that further shortfalls among OPEC members like Nigeria or Venezuela, both real possibilities, might add to nervousness in the markets.

“Prices could rise on concerns about further supply disruptions in key oil-producing countries and when the spare production capacity cushion in Saudi Arabia shrinks,” he said. “Much will depend, of course, on how much increased supply is needed from the kingdom.”

When spare capacity falls to low levels, traders become edgy, worrying about, among other things, whether the Saudis can indeed produce the 12.5 million barrels a day they say is within their capability.

During the summer, the Saudis, who are short of natural gas, also burn several hundred thousand barrels a day of crude oil to generate electricity to meet high demand for air-conditioning, which cuts into their exports.

How much the Saudis will increase production by will not be determined by OPEC in Vienna but in Riyadh, their capital, possibly in consultation with the country’s allies in the Gulf, like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

The flexible system of not assigning output quotas to individual countries allows some members of OPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia, to increase output to make up for shortfalls from members like Venezuela without protracted political battles over reassigning quotas.

This arrangement has worked well, especially for the Gulf countries. With the Saudis continually raising production when needed and then cutting back when customers are less thirsty, prices have been stable. Prices per barrel have averaged about $108 this year, compared with $109 in 2013 and $112 in 2012.

During this period, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have substantially increased their market share at the expense of the rest of OPEC.

Away from the opulent hotels of Vienna, where OPEC delegations sip coffee and chat with colleagues, the organization is divided in terms of the circumstances in its member countries.

Attention in the oil industry has also focused more recently on the United States, which has increased its production after a long decline through exploitation of so-called tight oil from shale rock.

But the United States, which does not export crude oil, can do little to make up for the drops around the world.

The price of crude oil has plunged to a five-year low – falling almost in half since June alone. So far the drop has been a boon for consumers, but oil-producing countries are feeling the pressure. In Russia, a previously emboldened Vladimir Putin is facing the prospect of economic collapse. Venezuela might have to reduce oil subsidies and aid to Cuba, which is opening relations with the United States as its vital ally teeters.

A strong dollar reflects the relative strength of the U.S. economy, but for big companies with customers around the world, a rising dollar can mean trouble. It hits corporate America in two ways, making goods produced in the U.S. more expensive to foreign customers and diminishing the value of sales collected in foreign currencies when corporations bring the money home.

The rising dollar is a key reason analysts forecast that first-quarter corporate earnings will fall 2.2 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ. They expect sales to sink 1.8 percent.

HOUSTON — The Singapore-flagged tanker BW Zambesi set sail with little fanfare from the port of Galveston, Tex., on July 30, loaded with crude oil destined for South Korea. But though it left inauspiciously, the ship’s launch was another critical turning point in what has been a half-decade of tectonic change for the American oil industry.

The 400,000 barrels the tanker carried represented the first unrestricted export of American oil to a country outside of North America in nearly four decades. The Obama administration insisted there was no change in energy trade policy, perhaps concerned about the reaction from environmentalists and liberal members of Congress with midterm elections coming. But many energy experts viewed the launch as the curtain raiser for the United States’ inevitable emergence as a major world oil exporter, an improbable return to a status that helped make the country a great power in the first half of the 20th century.

“The export shipment symbolizes a new era in U.S. energy and U.S. energy relations with the rest of the world,” said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. “Economically, it means that money that was flowing out of the United States into sovereign wealth funds and treasuries around the world will now stay in the U.S. and be invested in the U.S., creating jobs. It doesn’t change everything, but it certainly provides a new dimension to U.S. influence in the world.”

Like just about everything else in the oil and gas business, petroleum exports are contentious. The oil bounty is thanks to modern production techniques including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves injecting water and chemicals into the ground to crack oil-saturated shale. Exports would mean more of that. Many environmentalists say fracking operations endanger water supplies or create other hazards, including air pollution. Ramping up exports of fossil fuels, critics will surely note, is inconsistent with the Obama administration’s push for a global climate deal.

Independent refiners argue that exports could mean more expensive domestic oil for them, which they say could mean higher prices for American consumers.

Oil companies, and many independent economists, say just the opposite is true, because American exports would add to global supplies and lower international oil benchmark prices that ultimately determine the rise and fall of American gasoline prices. And with Russia causing mischief in Europe and the Middle East in turmoil, many analysts say allies would be happy to have a dependable supplier of oil. The oil companies appear to be grinding out a road to victory just as they have gained momentum in promoting natural gas exports against the opposition of some chemical companies and environmental groups that want to curb drilling and fracking. The Energy Department has begun a major study on the merits of exports, and how they would affect American consumers and United States energy security. Their previous study on gas exports backed the industry position.

A global oil price collapse, as unlikely as that might seem, is a wild card that could change the equation and stem momentum toward exports. Low prices, because of either excess supplies or reduced demand, would discourage investments and drilling worldwide.

Whatever the merits, the prospect of the United States becoming a major oil exporter was unthinkable as recently as 2008, when the conventional wisdom had it that the country was “addicted” — a word that even President George W. Bush famously used — to imported oil from unstable or unfriendly countries. Domestic production had been in free fall for decades as repeated presidential promises of “energy independence” echoed hollowly. But then came the frenzy of drilling in shale oil and gas fields across the country.

Domestic oil production has rocketed by roughly 70 percent over the last six years to 8.7 million barrels a day, and imports from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have already been cut roughly by half. With domestic oil production growing month after month, many oil experts predict that the country’s output will rise to as much as 12 million barrels a day over the next decade, which would mean the country will be swimming in oil the way it is currently dealing with a surplus of natural gas.

Analysts at Turner, Mason & Company, a Dallas engineering consulting firm, say the country could hit a saturation point when production hits 10 million to 10.5 million barrels a day, at which point large exports will become necessary or drilling and production may have to slow.

“A flood is upon us,” John Auers, a Turner, Mason senior vice president, recently told energy executives at a Houston oil conference. “We are getting close.”

The country will continue to import some grades of oil for years to come, but energy experts says oil exports should rise significantly over the next few years because of a mismatch in the type of oil the country now increasingly produces and the mix of oil its refineries were designed to process. Shale oil is predominately light, sweet oil, meaning it is low in sulfur content and flows freely at room temperature. American refineries can refine only so much of it because they were structured to process abundant amounts of much heavier crudes imported from Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. That is leading to a crude-oil glut in parts of the country’s midsection already — which has pushed oil companies to lobby for expanded exports and directly led to that recent shipment from Galveston.

The Galveston sailing was historic because the United States has strictly limited exports since the era of the Arab oil embargo, when President Jimmy Carter wore a cardigan sweater to encourage lower thermostats and other measures to limit the country’s dependence on foreign oil. In sweeping legislation, Congress in 1975 directed the president to prohibit the export of oil as “consistent with the national interest,” although broad exemptions were allowed. Various administrations since then have permitted limited exports, including shipments from Alaska’s Cook Inlet and to Canada, but the issue rarely came up because the country was seemingly running out of oil.

Then suddenly the energy world changed, and parts of the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico regions were overflowing with light grades of crude, leading to a slump in prices and a gap of as much as $15 between the United States oil benchmark and the prevailing Brent world price. Unable to export the excess light crude, the industry exported refined products like gasoline and diesel instead. In 2011, the country pivoted from being the world’s largest importer of petroleum products to becoming one of the leading exporters.

But the buildup in light crude has continued to outpace the capacity of refiners to process and export it, and that has spurred new thinking in Washington. In what appeared to be a trial balloon, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz last December suggested to reporters at a New York energy conference that it may be time for the administration to reconsider the export ban. “There are lots of issues in the energy space that deserve some new analysis and examination in the context of what is now an energy world that is no longer like the 1970s,” Mr. Moniz said at the time.

The first baby step toward a new policy came in June when the Commerce Department approved applications from two Texas energy companies, Pioneer Natural Resources and Enterprise Products Partners, to export light liquid hydrocarbons known as condensates that are normally characterized as crude oil even though they share attributes of both oil and natural gas and normally are found in gas form in the ground. The government ruled that since the companies had minimally processed the condensates through a simple oil processing unit that separates the gas and makes it safe for transport, the result was now considered a refined product.

Since refined products like gasoline and diesel are legal to export, the Obama administration said that the decision did not signal a reversal of the crude oil trade limits. Nevertheless, oil company executives and many Wall Street analysts who follow the oil industry interpreted the move as being a fundamental shift in direction. The country can now potentially export 300,000 barrels a day of condensates, most of which come out of the Eagle Ford shale oil field of South Texas, easing some of the glut of a product refiners cannot absorb and thus improving the profitability of drilling in the zone.

But the wording of the Commerce Department ruling means oil producers can potentially export much more than just condensates, since the department said it covered all crude oil that is processed through a distillation unit. Basic distillation can occur at the wellhead at minimal cost, and the new interpretation is likely to unleash investment in basic processing of oil in the field to meet the export requirements.","In the U.S., a Turning Point in the Flow of Oil",2014-10-08,"Thanks to new techniques, an oil bounty is likely to make the United States a major exporter of oil again.

LONDON — Oil fever gripped Britain on Thursday after a small company announced the discovery of what it described as “a possible world-class potential resource” in the Surrey countryside south of London near Gatwick Airport.

The company, UK Oil and Gas Investments, said an evaluation by an American company, Nutech, of a well drilled by the British company late last year indicated that there were 158 million barrels of oil per square mile in the terrain around it.

Investors and others noted that with UK Oil and Gas Investments and its partners holding licenses covering 55 square miles in what is known as the Weald Basin, they could be sitting on almost nine billion barrels of oil, a giant field if anything could be coaxed to the surface.

“We are pretty confident that this is a system that is comparable to the big things” in the United States, David Lenigas, the chairman of UK Oil and Gas, said by telephone.

Mr. Lenigas mentioned large American shale oil finds like the Bakken in North Dakota and Wolf Camp in Texas or the Bazhenov Shale Formation in Russia as possible analogs.

While UK Oil and Gas executives were enthusiastic — the company’s chief executive, Stephen Sanderson, told the BBC that the Weald could hold 50 billion to 100 billion barrels of oil, more than has been produced by the North Sea — experts were more skeptical. They noted that even if the oil were there, much more work would be required to find out how much, if any, could be extracted.

“Without drilling several wells and subjecting them to lengthy production tests (say 18 months) no one knows how much can be produced,” Richard Selley, a geologist at Imperial College in London, said in an email.

He said that UK Oil and Gas had reached its conclusion of what might be underground by extrapolating for the entire Weald Basin what was found in one spot of it. “This can do wonders for the share price,” he said.

Indeed, it did. UK Oil and Gas shares, which are listed on London’s small-company AIM exchange, soared almost fourfold early on Thursday before closing with a gain of 176 percent.

Mr. Lenigas makes no secret that he is trying to attract attention and raise money for the additional drilling needed to maximize the discovery. A spokesman for the company said by telephone that it would be receptive to a takeover. “We are here for takeover,” he said.

UK Oil and Gas owns about 20 percent of the licenses to drill at the site, Horse Hill, with the rest divided among several small operators and investors.

Still, the excitement in portions of the media and in the investment community indicates that many Britons are intrigued by the prospect of a new oil and gas industry despite the disapproval of environmental groups and local activists who worry that fracking will disrupt their lives and pollute their water supplies.

In an interview this year, Sarah O’Hara, a professor at Nottingham University who has conducted polling on public attitudes toward shale gas development, said, she did not think that Britons were “totally against at all.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ms. O’Hara’s polling, which began in 2012, has consistently found that more Britons favor shale gas exploration than are opposed to it, although opposition rose after protests over a well being drilled in 2013 near Balcombe, a village not far from Horse Hill.

Onshore oil and natural gas production is not new to Britain. Scattered across the landscape, there are about 120 sites with about 250 wells, according to the industry group United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas. The Weald is already a major onshore production area but for the most part, its wells appear to be small producers churning out just tens of barrels per day. Altogether, British onshore wells produce roughly 25,000 barrels per day of oil and gas — compared with around 1.4 million barrels per day for the North Sea.

Britain is the largest producer of oil in the European Union but accounts for about 1 percent of world oil output.

Some onshore wells have been in place for years but draw little attention. It is the specter of hydraulic fracturing, a process known as fracking that is used to produce oil and natural gas from shale rock, that raises fears.

Mr. Lenigas had soothing words for anyone worried that his company intends to start fracking, or otherwise disrupt their lives. The resources below the Weald will only need horizontal drilling because they have already been naturally fracked, he said.

“We don’t see any reason why this field is a fracking field,” he said. “Fracking is a ‘no’ for us.”

A spokesman at Gatwick Airport, which is just two miles away, said officials were unconcerned about the possible impact of a budding local oil industry on airport activities, including ambitions to build a second runway.

“We believe that this would have no impact on our runway expansion plans,” the spokesman, Grant Payne, said in a statement.

Residents in the area, on the other hand, are suspicious, and there were small protests last year during drilling activities. “It is clear that the companies involved are interested in shale oil,” said Rob Basto, a computer programmer who lives a few miles away in Reigate.

“One drill site may not appear too bad,” he continued. “But to get the sort of oil they are talking about would need thousands of sites across the area.”",Word of Oil Find Near Gatwick Excites Britain,2015-04-10,"While UK Oil and Gas executives were enthusiastic, energy experts were more skeptical about the potential of the find.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/business/energy-environment/word-of-oil-find-near-gatwick-excites-britain.html

Venezuela is digging its way to distressed seller status.

The country wants to offload Citgo, its American refinery and pipelines unit. It may be worth up to $15 billion, money that’s sorely needed because of President Nicolás Maduro’s foolish economic policies. And the drop in value of heavy-oil assets like Citgo owns makes it a bad time to sell.

There can be advantages to getting rid of refining businesses. ConocoPhillips, for example, spun out its fuel-processing plants as a standalone company in May 2012. The two separate companies are now worth a total of 61 percent more.

Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA has a different motive. Mr. Maduro’s administration is running out of cash. That’s the result of anti-business policies — including price controls and nationalization — that have depressed local production and increased reliance on imports. Access to dollars is rationed by a complex three-tier exchange rate that favors government projects over the private sector.

It has led to shortages of food and medical supplies, which explains PDVSA’s timing in putting its United States division up for sale. In recent years demand has weakened and prices fallen for the kind of heavier oil refining that accounts for about three-quarters of Citgo’s output. American refineries now make more from processing the light crude from the shale boom.

Processing heavy crude may pick up again, especially if the Keystone pipeline between Canada and the United States is approved. The last time there was a refining boom for this oil, for example, companies like Citgo traded at earnings multiples a third higher than where they are now, according to Raymond James.

There are some valuable assets in PDVSA’s outfit in the United States – not least terminals and pipes. That should give Lazard, which has just been appointed as adviser, something to work with.

Much of the proceeds from the sale, though, will probably have to cover the goods shortages. This means little, if any, of the cash is likely to be invested to reverse the decline in PDVSA’s oil output.

With the company now supplying over 95 percent of the nation’s hard currency, more neglect will only worsen Venezuela’s plight, increasing the need to raise cash. Potential Citgo buyers may be in for a fire sale.

HOUSTON — It pays to be big, at least when oil prices are coming down.

Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest American oil companies, reported surprisingly strong quarterly earnings on Friday. Despite the fall in oil prices, they had robust profits from their refining businesses, which for years were the plodding fifth wheels of their businesses.

But suddenly refineries are hot, especially in the United States, where oil and natural gas prices are particularly low — increasing refinery margins because of lower input costs and expanding exports of finished petroleum products. Only a few years ago, ConocoPhillips and several other companies were shedding their refineries, but Exxon Mobil and Chevron stuck to their business models, integrating production and processing.

The dividends from that decision were plain to see on Friday. Despite the 25 percent decline in oil prices in recent months, and lower earnings from their oil production, both Exxon and Chevron reported that they were able to compensate because their refineries and chemical businesses were booming.

Citing a 3 percent increase in earnings for the third quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago, Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chairman, said in a statement that the results “demonstrate the strength of our integrated business model.”

He added that the integration of refining and chemical production into Exxon Mobil’s business plan “gives us competitive advantages in scale, efficiency, technical and commercial capabilities regardless of market fluctuations over the business cycle.”

Exxon Mobil’s quarterly profit rose to $8.07 billion from $7.87 billion in the year-ago period. Profits from refining climbed to $1.02 billion from $592 million a year earlier. Earnings from exploration and production fell 4.4 percent.

Similarly, Chevron’s quarterly earnings rose to $5.59 billion compared with $4.95 billion a year earlier. Refining profits soared almost fourfold to $1.39 billion. Its earnings from oil and gas production in the United States and abroad fell modestly.

Chevron said that the average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids for the quarter was $93 a barrel, down from $104 a barrel a year ago. The average natural gas price was $5.73 per thousand cubic feet compared with $5.88 for the same quarter in 2013.

“Both companies had very good quarters because refining results exceeded expectations,” said Brian M. Youngberg, a senior energy analyst at Edward Jones. “It bodes well for the fourth quarter, but beyond that, the direction of oil prices will be the main driver for energy stocks.”

The oil business faces new uncertainties because of the decline in petroleum prices that comes from supply increases from North America and several OPEC countries, including Libya and Saudi Arabia.

Exxon Mobil and Chevron have recently slowed their investment spending after stepping up big exploration and production projects around the world in recent years, and they did not indicate any important changes in their strategies.

“Our priorities haven’t changed,” said Patricia E. Yarrington, Chevron’s vice president and chief financial officer, in a conference call Friday. But she added, “We’re having some tough discussions” about where oil prices are expected to go as budget planning continues on future investments.

Beyond oil prices, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both face some significant challenges. Exxon Mobil’s drilling in the Russian Arctic is in jeopardy because of Western sanctions after Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine, while Chevron is facing rising costs in its large liquefied natural gas export projects in Australia.

ConocoPhillips this week announced a 4 percent decline in its investments next year, even as it expects to increase production over this year. But on the whole, oil executives have expressed optimism that they will not have to cut their investments in exploration and production, at least not soon or by a measurable amount. Suncor, the giant Canadian producer, said oil prices would have to decline by more than a third before it would change its plans.

“We’re not expecting to adjust capital expenditures in response to oil prices,” Brian Gilvary, BP’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call this week. “The balance sheet could more than comfortably handle $80 a barrel.”

Hess announced this week that it would move forward with a $6 billion project, the development of a big Gulf of Mexico deepwater field in partnership with Chevron, Statoil and Nexen, despite the recent drop in oil prices. Nevertheless, Hess executives have estimated that the company’s profit will decline $8 million in the current quarter for every $1 decrease in the price of oil.

Oil experts are deeply divided over which way crude prices will go in the coming months. Some estimates go as low as $75 a barrel while others view the instability in producing countries like Libya, Nigeria and Iraq as increasing the likelihood that prices will rebound to $90 a barrel or more.

Wood Mackenzie, the international consultancy, estimated this week that the bulk of investments in United States shale oil fields, the driver of the production boom in recent years, were viable even if the American benchmark West Texas Intermediate were to go down to $70 to $75 a barrel. The benchmark hovered around $80 on Friday.

United States oil production, currently approaching nine million barrels a day, is at the highest level in 28 years. The Energy Department expects production to reach 9.5 million barrels a day next year, a pace of expansion that has created worry and tension within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. But OPEC’s secretary general, Abdullah al-Badri, this week said the cartel was unlikely to cut supplies next year to increase prices.","At Exxon Mobil and Chevron, Refining Businesses Support Earnings",2014-11-01,The two largest American oil companies said their refining businesses more than made up for the recent drop in the price of crude oil.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-and-chevron-report-3Q-earnings.html

Democrats, long accustomed to being on the outside looking in at power in this right-leaning state, have almost nothing but praise for the new governor and his proposals.

“He’s in a beautiful position in some respects, because he doesn’t owe the traditional political establishment anything,” said Senator Berta Gardner, a Democrat and the Senate minority leader. “He’s not a politician, and that’s going to create some hurdles for him, but he has made some very good choices.”

The new governor, for his part, has said that Alaska’s distinctive political culture, economy and history — its days as a territory before statehood in 1959 still fresh and resonant, its relatively small population accustomed to politics with a homespun accessibility — will make for a unique, if tough, solution.

In one respect, Alaska is also extremely lucky: lawmakers set aside about $14 billion in savings during the fat years, which Mr. Walker has called “a bridge,” which must be trod gingerly. Tapping too little of it, he said, would force even more drastic spending cuts; spending too much could deplete the fund before the crisis has past.

“Before we had money, we had guts,” he said in a recent speech, quoting Walter J. Hickel, the former Alaska governor and United States interior secretary, whom Mr. Walker has called a personal hero and mentor.

But an alternative model for the new Walker administration has also emerged — a surprising one, perhaps — in Sarah Palin. Mr. Walker and his allies say the current moment harks back to her election as governor in 2006: She was outside her party establishment, though nominally a Republican, and worked with a coalition of Democrats and Republicans after a spate of scandals involving the oil industry. (Ms. Palin endorsed Mr. Walker last fall, though they have not communicated since the election.)

“She took on an incumbent governor, as I did,” Mr. Walker said in an interview. “She did it within the party, I did it outside the party — so there could be some comparisons.”

Alaska still has billions of dollars of accumulated and untapped wealth. In the last decade, as much of the rest of the nation was staggering through recession, the state was in fact booming as oil prices surged. A $53 billion fund from past oil revenues, which pays dividends to residents from investment earnings, has churned along as well, with last year’s payment of $1,884 per person one of the biggest ever. That fund is wholly separate from the state budget.

Oil production, meanwhile, has slid — to barely a fourth of what it was at its peak in the late 1980s — as old wells drilled a generation ago produce less. Declining oil sales have compounded the impact of the price declines.

The governor’s secret weapon, though, his allies said, might be public support — if he can sustain it and use it as a lobbying force.

In building his administration, he enlisted hundreds of ordinary residents and experts in his transition team. In looking for budget solutions, he threw the door open to suggestions, rewarding the five best ideas with lunch with the governor and the lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott. Thousands of ideas have come in, Mr. Walker said.

“That’s my challenge and my opportunity — to reach out to those folks and let them know we have an open door,” he said. “We have to turn our cards face up.”","As Oil Prices Fall, Alaska’s New Governor Faces a Novel Goal, Frugality",2015-01-26,"Taxes paid by oil companies account for 90 percent of the state&#8217;s operating budget, and those revenues have sunk with stomach-churning suddenness and depth.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/us/as-oil-falls-alaskas-new-chief-faces-a-novel-goal-frugality.html

A few hedge fund managers have been tiptoeing back into the beaten-down energy sector.

While many investors, including Warren E. Buffett, were selling energy stocks in the final three months of 2014, several hedge funds sought to profit on the turmoil, regulatory filings showed on Tuesday. Third Point, the firm run by Daniel S. Loeb, acquired a sizable stake in the oil refinery company Phillips 66, while Leon G. Cooperman’s Omega Advisors amassed a new position in Laredo Petroleum, and Viking Global Investors, led by Andreas Halvorsen, increased its stake in Cheniere Energy by several million shares.

At the same time, other hedge funds reduced their holdings of technology stocks, including Apple and Alibaba, which had recently attracted investors in droves.

These moves, by some of Wall Street’s most prominent investors, were disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing a partial snapshot of hedge funds’ holdings as of the end of the year. The filings, submitted by a Tuesday deadline, shed some light on which companies and sectors were attracting the affection — or the skepticism — of the so-called smart money.

Investing in energy in recent months has required a strong stomach. The price of a barrel of crude oil, after trading around $100 in June, fell to about $43 in January, putting pressure on a range of oil and gas companies and funds that invested heavily in energy stocks. The filings show Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold its 41 million shares of Exxon Mobil during the fourth quarter, while Greenlight Capital, David Einhorn’s hedge fund, sold its entire two million-share stake in the British oil giant BP. Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners sold its 3.4 million shares in the Apache Corporation, the oil and gas company.

To some hedge fund managers, the rout apparently provided an opportunity for bottom-fishing. Mr. Loeb’s Third Point acquired five million shares of Phillips 66, a stake worth $384.5 million as of Tuesday. Omega Advisors, meanwhile, acquired 2.1 million shares of Laredo Petroleum and 652,500 shares of Sanchez Energy Corporation. But at the same time, Omega sold about 29 percent of its big stake in SandRidge Energy, ending the quarter with 32.2 million shares.

ValueAct Capital, an activist hedge fund, acquired big new positions in Halliburton and Baker Hughes, two oil field services companies that agreed to a $34.6 billion merger in November. The two stakes, each worth more than $900 million, could make ValueAct a forceful advocate for the deal, which will be subject to shareholder votes in March.

While it is far from certain that these energy bets will pay off, some stocks in the sector are showing signs of improvement. Fairholme Capital Management, the fund founded by Bruce R. Berkowitz, bought a stake in the oil and gas company Canadian Natural Resources, whose shares fell 20.5 percent in the fourth quarter but are up 3.6 percent so far this year. Similarly, Eton Park Capital Management, which was started by a Goldman Sachs alumnus, Eric Mindich, bought shares of the natural gas producer EQT. That company’s stock fell 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter but is up 7.8 percent this year.

Some hedge funds showed caution in the technology sector. One longtime fan of Apple, Mr. Einhorn, who once took the company to court over a plan to eliminate preferred shares, reduced Greenlight Capital’s stake in Apple by about 6 percent, to 8.6 million shares, which were worth more than $1 billion as of Tuesday. Another hedge fund, Coatue Management, which focuses on technology, reduced its Apple holdings by about 15 percent, to 8.9 million shares, as of the end of 2014.

Appaloosa Management, David Tepper’s hedge fund, sold its entire 1.2 million-share stake in Apple, as well as its holdings in Facebook and the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, which became a hedge fund darling after going public in September. Mr. Tepper’s move on Alibaba appears well-timed, since the stock fell this year after peaking in the fall. With Apple, however, Mr. Tepper and his rivals have been confounded by the stock’s rally so far this year.

These disclosures are limited in important ways. Backward-looking and static, they show only the holdings of United States-listed stocks at the end of the fourth quarter. And they do not include any short positions, or bets against particular stocks.

What’s more, any apparent trends among the hedge funds fail to capture the diversity of the moves. Mr. Loeb, for example, increased his fund’s existing stake in Alibaba during the quarter, while Mr. Einhorn acquired a new stake in Yahoo, an older technology giant. Greenlight Capital also bought 1.25 million shares of Green Dot, one of the nation’s largest sellers of prepaid debit cards. This month, Green Dot, as previously announced by the company, stopped selling its popular MoneyPak prepaid product over concerns about it being misused by online swindlers.

In addition to showing what stocks are getting attention, the filings help reveal how upstart hedge funds are mapping their strategies.

Among the most closely watched of these funds are those run by disciples of Steven A. Cohen, the head of the former SAC Capital Advisors. That firm pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 2013 and has since rebranded itself as Point72 Asset Management, a $10 billion family office that manages mainly Mr. Cohen’s personal fortune.

Gabriel Plotkin, who was one of the top portfolio managers at SAC, set out on his own last year, raising about $1 billion, including a $200 million commitment from Mr. Cohen, for his own hedge fund, Melvin Capital Management.

And Mr. Plotkin did not waste much time putting that money to work, taking positions in more than 40 stocks with an estimated value of $900 million, according to the fund’s regulatory filing. Mr. Plotkin specialized in investing in consumer stocks at SAC, and Melvin Capital appears to be no different, with the fund buying stakes in Amazon.com, the Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Deere & Company, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and Yum Brands.

Other relatively new hedge funds led by former disciples of Mr. Cohen are Aaron Cowen’s Suvretta Capital Management and Jason Karp’s Tourbillon Capital Partners. In the fourth quarter, Suvretta reported selling a 467,000-share position in Anadarko Petroleum and a 223,890-share position in Ashland, a specialty chemical company. The fund acquired a new 629,600-share position in Facebook in the period.

Tourbillon, in the fourth quarter, purchased a new 1.45 million share stake in Applied Materials and increased its stake in Cheniere Energy by about 630,000 shares. The fund exited a 280,000-share position in Zebra Technologies.","Seeing Value After a Plunge, Hedge Funds Bet on Energy Stocks",2015-02-17,Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission provide a partial snapshot of hedge funds’ holdings as of the end of the year.,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/hedge-funds-offer-peek-at-their-holdings/
341,"SINGAPORE — Plunging oil prices have brought a big rally in Asian government bond markets, as lower fuel costs have cut inflation expectations, but the rally could be built on shaky foundations: Makers of monetary policy remain out of step with tumbling bond yields.

The price of oil, of which Asia is a net importer, has halved in less than six months, driving bond yields down across the region. From India to South Korea, markets seem to be anticipating looser monetary policy to accommodate the resulting slowing of inflation.

The imminence of further monetary easing in Europe and Japan builds a strong case for bond yields to drop further.

But there is little sign yet of official rate cuts, particularly in markets like Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, where central banks were sounding aggressive or even raising rates into the final months of 2014.

“The oil price has caught central banks by surprise,” said ING’s chief Asian economist, Tim Condon.

“The panic of 2013 is right now foremost in their minds, and they are looking at a Fed rate hike, and so I think they will remain pretty dug in,” he added.

The fear of a repeat of 2013’s “taper tantrum,” when talk of the Federal Reserve’s withdrawing monetary stimulus prompted vast sums of foreign capital to bail out of the region, helps explain why Asian central banks might err on the side of tighter monetary policy.

But there are other factors that also suggest official policy will stay tighter than the bond markets imply.

For one, a rising United States dollar is pushing down all emerging market currencies, which indirectly eases monetary conditions for Asian policy makers and creates pressure on them to keep interest rates up to prevent the flight of foreign cash.

The market mismatch is evident in Indonesia, where the rupiah has fallen 9 percent against the dollar in the past six months.

Ten-year Indonesian government bond yields, which are normally significantly higher than overnight policy rates to reflect the risk of holding bonds to term, are just 0.05 percentage point above the 7.75 percent policy rate, having fallen 0.6 percentage point since mid-December.

One plausible scenario that could bring about a bond market tumble is a drastic improvement in United States growth numbers in the next couple months as a result of lower oil costs, leading to renewed optimism about global growth and an increase in Treasury bond yields.

Far from cutting rates, policy makers might then have to raise rates.

The odds of this high-growth scenario playing out are perhaps reflected in how well equity markets have held up despite worries about slowing inflation, patchy economic growth and the possibility that Greece could return to the emergency room.

Despite a wobbly start to 2015, Asian shares are up 6 percent in the past three months.

“We are apparently on the edge of deflation, and yet equity markets aren’t collapsing,” said the Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Claudio Piron. “And there are certain elements to what is going on which are reminiscent of the Asian financial crisis — oil prices falling, dollar strengthening, bonds rallying strongly — which all seems very ominous.”

With the exception of Thailand, none of Asia’s central banks have explicitly spoken of the need for easier policy.

Inflation has slowed sharply, except in Indonesia and Malaysia, where fuel subsidies were cut late last year.

Although consumer price inflation in the Philippines is well below the central bank’s expected 3 percent average for the year, the rhetoric from policy makers suggests markets may hope for rates to be on hold.

On the other hand, Indonesia’s inflation is running at nearly double the official forecast range for this year, thanks to a jump in domestic oil prices.

Mr. Condon of ING does not expect any of Asia’s central banks to react in a hurry to either oil or slowing inflation, and instead says they might be prepared to tolerate lower inflation, just as the European Central Bank and Fed do.

“There is some sort of asymmetry there. It’s O.K. to undershoot inflation; it’s prohibitive to overshoot. That, I think, will be the story in Asia as well,” he said.

Some market participants recognize that bias, which is possibly why short-end yields in Asian bond markets have not moved much. But in longer-term yields, investors might read a warning that 2015 will hold more pain than gain.",Oil Drives Bond Rally in Asia,2015-01-13,But the rally could have a shaky foundation.

Internet Radio Royalties

The Copyright Royalty Board, a panel of three federal judges in Washington, will begin hearings on Monday on royalty rates for webcasting and Internet radio services like Pandora and iHeartRadio for the next five years. The case is being closely watched in the music industry, where streaming has become increasingly popular but artists have complained about low earnings from online outlets.

The judges’ decision will be particularly consequential for Pandora, which now pays almost half its revenue to license recordings. The music industry supports an increased rate, while Pandora and others including iHeartMedia — the broadcaster formerly known as Clear Channel, which operates iHeartRadio — want a lower rate. The judges’ decision is expected by December. —Ben Sisario

Apple Earnings

Apple’s explosive sales in China are continuing to be the main driver of its financial growth. When Apple discloses its earnings for its second quarter on Monday, analysts predict the company will report selling roughly 60 million iPhones, thanks in large part to the Chinese New Year holiday in February. Apple’s big-screen iPhones have been especially popular in China, and the company says it is only a matter of time until most of Apple’s sales come from that region. —Brian X. Chen

Automakers Report

Investors will be focusing on international operations when two carmakers, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, report first-quarter earnings this week. Both companies are expected to post good results in the booming United States market. But Ford, which reports on Tuesday, has been investing heavily in China to increase production and sales there, while trying to return its troubled European operations to profitability.

The Spanish lender Santander, the French bank BNP Paribas and the British lenders Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered are all scheduled to announce the results of their operations. Operating conditions have been generally positive for banks in the first quarter, and lenders are getting past conduct issues that have dogged previous results. —Chad Bray

Lufthansa Meeting

Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, will hold its annual shareholders meeting in Hamburg on Wednesday, barely a month after a co-pilot for the group’s Germanwings subsidiary was found to have deliberately crashed his plane into the French Alps — killing himself and 149 others, and throwing the company into perhaps the worst crisis of its 60-year history.

Presiding over the meeting will be Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa’s chief executive, who took the helm a year ago with a mandate to reduce costs sharply in the face of mounting competitive pressure and tense relations with pilots, who have carried out a series of costly strikes. —Nicola Clark

Oil Companies Report

Several of the world’s largest oil companies will report earnings for the first quarter. BP and Total of France announce results on Tuesday. They will be followed by ENI of Italy on Wednesday and Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil on Thursday.

Analysts are forecasting a sharp drop in earnings compared with a year earlier because oil prices are about 50 percent below last year’s levels and natural gas prices in the United States are also low. Bernstein Research in London forecasts that BP’s earnings will fall by 62 percent, to $1.2 billion, and Royal Dutch Shell’s net income will be down 49 percent, to $2.3 billion.

The one bright spot for the major oil companies has been refining, where strong demand, low oil prices and cost-cutting have improved profitability, even at hard-pressed European refiners. At companies like Total and Shell, a good refining performance is likely to have partly cushioned the impact of the oil price drop. —Stanley Reed

Tesla Announcement

Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, is expected to announce two new battery products at a news event Thursday evening in Los Angeles. One battery will be for home use, and the other will be for utility companies.

On Saturday, more than 40,000 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders will descend on Omaha for the annual meeting of the company, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary. The gathering is known as Woodstock for Capitalists. Warren E. Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive, and Charles T. Munger, its vice chairman, take questions for more than six hours, and their answers often make news.

Health care stocks rose after the generic-drug maker Mylan bid $29 billion for the rival Perrigo. In Europe, the oil company Royal Dutch Shell agreed to buy the BG Group for $69.7 billion in cash and stock.

That offset a slump in energy stocks prompted by a big drop in oil prices.

Corporations worldwide are seeking to increase growth through acquisitions and have announced almost $1 trillion worth of deals so far this year, according to the data provider Dealogic. That is elevating stock markets as the acquiring companies typically offer a premium for their targets.

Daniel Morris, global investment strategist at the investment company TIAA-CREF, said a debate was occurring about whether deals “are value-creating or value-destroying,” but he added that “in the short term, it is generally good for markets.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 5.57 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,081.90. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 27.09 points, to 17,902.51. The Nasdaq gained 40.59 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,950.82.

Investors were also parsing the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting for clues about the timing of a possible interest rate increase, and waiting for companies to start reporting their first-quarter earnings.

Over all, earnings per share are projected to decline by about 3 percent for S.&P. 500 companies, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That would be the first contraction since the third quarter of 2009, when the economy was emerging from the recession.

On Wednesday, Perrigo was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. The stock surged $30.29, or 18.4 percent, to $195, after Mylan announced that it had made a cash-and-stock offer for the company.

Both Mylan and Perrigo recently left the United States for Europe. If they combine they would form one of the world’s largest makers of generic and over-the-counter medicines. Mylan’s stock also rose, gaining $8.79, or 14.8 percent, to $68.36.

Energy stocks were the biggest decliners on the day, falling as the price of oil plunged nearly 7 percent, its biggest drop in two months. This was after the Energy Department reported an increase in oil storage that was about three times what analysts had expected.

Crude stocks rose by 11 million barrels during the week ending April 3, reaching a new high for this time of year. Benchmark United States crude fell $3.56, to settle at $50.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many refineries in the United States, fell $3.55, to $55.55, in London.

Government bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 1.91 percent, up from 1.89 percent.

Gasoline prices have fallen more than 40 percent since the end of June thanks to the collapse of global oil prices. That makes this the perfect time for Congress to overcome its longstanding terror of offending the nation’s motorists and raise the tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. The results could only be beneficial: for the nation’s roads, bridges and transit systems, which badly need repair; for the budget; and, to the extent that higher taxes encourage greater fuel efficiency, for the climate.

The federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon on gas and 24.4 cents on diesel has not been increased since 1993. That has severely shortchanged the Highway Trust Fund, which is expected to run out of money in May if Congress does not transfer more into it or raise fuel taxes. If the federal tax on gasoline had simply kept up with inflation, it would be 30 cents today.

There is little doubt that the nation’s road and transit systems could use more help. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave them a nearly failing grade of D in 2013; the state of bridges is somewhat better, earning a C-plus. The country’s inadequate road and transit systems cost it billions through increased delays, extra fuel costs and auto repair bills. Poor road conditions are also said to play a significant factor in about one-third of all traffic fatalities, or about 10,000 deaths a year.

Some lawmakers, including some Republicans, are concerned enough about these trends to discuss an increase in fuel taxes. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, has proposed increasing the tax, and Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and a big supporter of the energy industry, has said he is willing to consider it. Some state leaders are also considering raising their own fuel taxes. Lawmakers in Michigan have put a gas tax increase on the ballot for a May election, and Iowa lawmakers are also talking about a higher tax.

The Obama administration has not thrown its support behind an increase because it is afraid, it seems, of political blowback. A White House spokesman said last week that the administration would prefer to find the money for roads, bridges, transit and other public works by closing corporate tax loopholes. That approach would require a much larger compromise with Republicans on tax policy, which seems unlikely. More important, it would not create the kind of dedicated and ongoing source of revenue the country’s transportation system needs.

A modest increase in the gas tax phased in over a few months or a year would hardly be noticeable to most Americans, especially now that drivers have seen the cost of gasoline fall so much and so quickly — although some way should be found to offset the tax increase for low-income Americans, who would suffer most. The average retail price of gasoline in the United States was $2.308 a gallon for the week ended Jan. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration; that is down from $3.778 at the end of June. The E.I.A. estimates that the average American household will spend $550 less on gas this year compared with 2014.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that Congress would have to raise fuel taxes by between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon to meet all of the obligations of the Highway Trust Fund.

358,"When a group of investors led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bought the oil producer Samson Resources for $7.2 billion more than three years ago, analysts regarded the deal as a triumph.

Now, burdened by tumbling oil prices and a heavy debt load, Samson may file for bankruptcy protection.

The company disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it might try to reorganize under Chapter 11. It added that it had hired advisers to assist in its efforts.

The announcement, tucked into Samson’s annual report, has taken few on Wall Street by surprise. What was once considered a proud achievement has since become a symbol of the troubles straining the oil industry as the price of petroleum hovers at its lowest levels in years.

As of Tuesday evening, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil was $47.69 a barrel, less than half of what it was at the time of the transaction. The price of natural gas also tumbled, further squeezing the company’s profits.

Samson’s troubles are readily apparent from its 2014 results. Cash flow from operations fell 29 percent from the year before, to $488 million. And its net debt load grew to $3.9 billion.

Samson’s troubles have been so deep that its falling value has weighed heavily on K.K.R., whose fourth-quarter results fell 89 percent in part because of the value of its energy holdings. The company has since taken a number of steps to shore up its financial position, including stopping drilling, selling assets and laying off employees.

In March, the credit rating agency Moody’s said in a research note that Samson faced “a high risk of default.”

369,"But the trend is dangerous. The low inflation environment was already a signal of a listless economy, with consumers spending little despite low prices and companies having scant incentive to invest in their businesses.

If prices actually fall for an extended period, consumers might delay purchase in hopes of getting a better deal later, and businesses would see little reason to make products that would be worth less with each passing month.

Falling Prices The eurozone inflation rate fell below zero in December for the first time in more than five years. Eurozone inflation rate Change from year earlier + 4 % + 3 + 2 + 1 0 DEC.: –0.2% – 1 ’04 ’06 ’08 ’10 ’12 ’14

""We’re not yet in a self-sustaining spiral,” said Gilles Moec, chief European economist at Bank of America in London. “But we’re close.”

The labor market provides one illustration of what makes Europe’s situation particularly complicated to fix.

A separate official report on Wednesday showed that the eurozone jobless rate remained at 11.5 percent in November, around the level at which it has been for the last year. But overall numbers don’t give a complete picture of what’s happening in each country, where fortunes are diverging.

In Germany, which has the bloc’s biggest economy, unemployment fell to 6.4 percent in December from 6.5 percent in November. But in the second- and third-largest of the eurozone economies, France and Italy, the jobless rates climbed, with Italian unemployment reaching a new high of 13.4 percent.

And in Greece and Spain, about a quarter of the population remains without work, a level consistent with economic depression.

Analysts said on Wednesday that it was now a certainty that the European Central Bank would announce aggressive new measures when it meets in Frankfurt on Jan. 22. They expect the central bank to say it is ready to begin effectively printing money that it would use to buy eurozone government bonds, even if it does not put the measures into practice for several months.

In doing so, the bank would follow an unconventional policy similar to the quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the American economy.

But quantitative easing is a divisive issue in Europe because of questions about how to allocate the bond buying among eurozone countries, and who would pay if a government defaulted on bonds held by the central bank. That uncertainty is a main reason that Germany does not want to put its taxpayers at risk of having to bail out the bloc’s weaker neighbors.

The central bank has an official goal of trying to keep inflation at just below 2 percent, which it considers an optimal level for a healthy economy. But the bank has not met that target in two years.

Japan’s experience in the 1990s showed that traditional monetary policy instruments are largely ineffective with nominal interest rates at zero, as they essentially are now in the eurozone.

Another way to address the problem might be for eurozone countries to drop their insistence on balancing budgets and to instead use tax cuts and public spending to create demand.

So far, though, European officials appear to be holding their course.

“Yes, the eurozone is going through a period of low inflation,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance officials, said in a statement in response to a New York Times query. “But one of the most important reasons for the current low inflation rate is the falling oil price. Core inflation — excluding oil prices — has recently slightly increased.”

The core inflation rate, which excludes energy and food prices, ticked up to 0.8 percent in December from 0.7 percent the month before, according to Wednesday’s data.

The German government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which has taken a tough line against coordinated economic stimulus, indicated that the latest data had not altered its thinking. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said in Berlin on Wednesday that Germany would not revise its analysis that there was no risk of deflation in the country. That statement came despite a report on Monday showing that German consumer prices rose 0.1 percent last month.

Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, on Wednesday defended the German view, saying that the danger was being overstated in light of the debt overload that was behind the global and European financial crisis that developed in 2008.

“It’s inevitable after the bursting of a debt bubble that inflation is low, as consumers and business repay their debts and spend only hesitantly,” he said.

Some of the weakness in prices reflects lower labor costs in the weaker “peripheral” eurozone members, he said, something that can make their economies more competitive. “We do not have harmful deflation,” he said.

There is no question, though, that the eurozone is ailing. The bloc’s economy expanded 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2014 on an annualized basis. That is far short of the United States economy’s 5.0 percent growth, and recent data suggest that the eurozone pace has been slowing.

That stark difference is one reason the value of the euro currency has been plunging compared to the dollar in recent weeks. It fell again on Wednesday after the inflation report, declining more than 0.5 percent to $1.1816 — its lowest level in nine years. As was the case the last time the euro was this low, fund managers are moving investments to the United States in expectations of a better return on their money.

Consumer prices in the eurozone had not contracted on an annual basis since October 2009, when the slack global economy made the bottom fall out of the market for oil and other commodities. December’s negative rate was down from the 0.3 percent increase in November.

Well before eurozone consumer prices tipped below zero, the region’s low inflation rate had been raising alarms.

Economists with the International Monetary Fund warned early last year that the difference between ultralow inflation, which they called lowflation, and outright deflation was mainly a matter of degrees, as the weak price pressures could “scupper the nascent recovery and pressure the most fragile countries.”

Mr. Draghi, the central bank president, said last week in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt that the risk of deflation “cannot be ruled out completely, but it is limited.”

“We are not there yet,” Mr. Draghi said. “But we need to tackle this risk.”

Investors have been snapping up government bonds of eurozone countries amid expectations that a European Central Bank purchasing program would make them more valuable. Yields on German, French and Belgian bonds have all hit record lows this week.

Ireland on Wednesday was able to issue seven-year bonds at a yield of 0.867 percent, an astonishingly low rate for a country that was bailed out by the I.M.F. and the European Union in 2010.

Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, wrote in a note on Wednesday that the contraction in consumer prices “is a severe blow to the credibility” of the European Central Bank.

“The E.C.B.’s hand has been forced,” he said. “Anything less than a firm pledge by its president, Mario Draghi, that sovereign quantitative easing is imminent will be taken very badly by markets.""",Prices Fall and Worry Escalates in the Eurozone,2015-01-08,"The decline, raising fears of economic stagnation, increases pressure on the European Central Bank to prevent a debilitating downward price spiral.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/business/international/europe-economy-deflation.html

371,"With Congress producing so little legislation, governors’ offices have become attractive targets, Mr. Wertheimer said. Last year, the Republican Governors Public Policy Committee allowed corporate donors to make their cases on how to carry out the Affordable Care Act; discuss hydraulic fracturing, an oil- and gas-exploration method regulated at the state level; and hash over state budgets just as coffers began to loosen.

The spokeswoman for the governors association, Gail Gitcho, said the organization did not reveal the names of donors to its tax-exempt arm, and she denounced CREW as a group of partisan hypocrites who refused to divulge their own donors as they unmasked others. CREW has for years maintained that it is nonpartisan, but last month, it was taken over by David Brock, a former conservative who now runs a network of groups aligned with Democrats.

“CREW accessed those documents from behind a password-protected website,” Ms. Gitcho said. “CREW hides behind the facade of an educational group when their only real purpose is to act as a liberal front group for Democrats.”

In a tit for tat, the Republican association unearthed documents from the Democratic Governors Association that also name corporate donors and the benefits: meetings with Democratic governors, “preferred seating” at policy discussions, and lavish receptions. But those documents do not detail contribution levels, nor do they reveal the corporate members of the Democratic association’s own secretive 501(c)(4), the Center for Innovative Policy.

Among the R.G.A. documents is a 21-page schedule of the policy committee’s Carlsbad meeting last year that lists which companies attended, who represented them and what they contributed. The most elite group, known as the Statesmen, whose members donated $250,000, included Aetna; Coca-Cola; Exxon Mobil; Koch Companies Public Sector, the lobbying arm of the highly political Koch Industries; Microsoft; Pfizer; UnitedHealth Group; and Walmart. The $100,000 Cabinet level included Aflac, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Comcast, Hewlett-Packard, Novartis, Shell Oil, Verizon Communications and Walgreen.

Other documents detail, in part, what they received in return.

One 2009 document states the benefits of a Governors Board membership, for a $50,000 annual contribution or a one-time donation of $100,000, saying it “offers the ability to bring their particular expertise to the political process while helping to support the Republican agenda.”

Board members received two tickets to “an exclusive breakfast with the Republican governors and members of their staff”; three tickets to the Governors Forums Series, where “a group of 5-8 governors discuss the best policy practices from around the country on a particular topic”; and a D.C. Discussion Breakfast Series, among other events.

If they bump up to Cabinet Membership — $100,000 annually or a single payment of $200,000 — contributors also receive two invitations to “an exclusive Gubernatorial Dinner,” an “intimate gathering with the Republican governors and special Republican V.I.P. guests” at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington.

Political finance experts say the practice apparently laid out in the documents is not illegal, and probably not unusual. In hundreds of pages posted online, the Republican governors group put it down in black and white.

“It’s not that you don’t suspect this, but here you see these companies paying the governors for access,” said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of CREW. “Americans all think it’s pay-to-play politics. This is what confirms it.”

Donors refused to comment on their membership in the 501(c)(4). But those who would speak more broadly said they had also given to Democrats. Cynthia Michener, a spokeswoman for Aetna, pointed to the company’s public political contributions disclosure, which showed gifts of $300,000 each to the Republican and Democratic governors associations last year. It lists nothing to the two groups’ tax-exempt arms.

Photo

The R.G.A. documents, dating to 2008, show just how well the governors’ corporate contributors have been treated. Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah and the Mississippi governor at the time, Haley Barbour, hosted donors in 2010 at the St. Regis Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, for an event featuring skiing and snowmobiling. At the association’s 2012 annual conference in Las Vegas, donors not only received access to the governors, staff and “V.I.P. guests,” but were also treated to an “under the Eiffel Tower” event at the Paris Las Vegas hotel’s Chateau Nightclub, taken clay shooting and offered a “back of house” tour at Wynn Las Vegas.

Of course, the perks came with a cost. Hotel room drops, the gifts welcoming attendees to Las Vegas, ran to $7,500 per sponsor. One donor was sought to sponsor wireless Internet in the meeting spaces for $25,000.

The governors association’s 2011 annual conference in Orlando included a welcoming reception at Universal Studios’ Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a golf swing clinic, afternoons at SeaWorld and Disney World, and a late-night party hosted by the lobbying firms Blank Rome Government Relations and Dutko Grayling.

Also in 2011, the Republican governors Rick Perry of Texas, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia gathered donors at the Newseum and the W Hotel, among other Washington sites, for dinners, senior staff briefings and an invitation-only breakfast.

This month, Mr. McDonnell, whose term ended in January, was convicted of public corruption charges for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, loans and gifts from a donor. During the trial, Mr. McDonnell’s tenure leading the Republican Governors Association came up often as a window into the group’s high-stakes fund-raising.

Tax documents filed this year show that the R.G.A. raised $27 million last year, much of it from declared corporate donors such as Chrysler, Archer Daniels Midland, Altria and Genworth Financial.

The list of members of the tax-exempt arm of the governors association attending the Carlsbad symposium included three executives from Dutko Grayling, David Beightol, Mary Kay Hogan and Steve Palmer; Loren Monroe of BGR Group and his wife; three executives from WellPoint and Anthem Blue Cross, including Michael Prosio, who was a top aide to Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was the governor of California; and the utility representatives Stoney Burke, the chief lobbyist at Southern Company, and Brad Viator, the director of external affairs at the Edison Electric Institute.

Many of the names of the R.G.A.’s corporate donors would be expected: Allen Richardson, a government affairs manager at Koch Companies Public Sector; Randy Kozuch and Erika Scheffer, political affairs executives at the National Rifle Association; Bill Miller, the chief lobbyist at the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the largest companies; and Bill Guidera, the senior vice president of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — With global oil prices plunging at a pace not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, Saudi Arabia is emerging as a central player, accused by some of deliberately depressing the market to weaken rivals like Iran but looked to by others as the only hope of ending the rout. Still others say that the oil colossus is merely struggling to deal with its diminished position in an industry it once dominated.

For their part, Saudi officials have signaled that they are prepared to endure reduced profits rather than slash production in an effort to prop up prices, as they did to their later regret in the early 1980s.

Yet the Saudi acceptance of lower prices has even touched off a controversy inside the kingdom. This week, the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal released an open letter to the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, criticizing him for saying that lower oil prices were no cause for alarm.

In the letter, Prince Alwaleed called the price drop a “catastrophe that cannot go unmentioned” and suggested it could harm the kingdom’s budget.

Some analysts say Saudi Arabia runs few risks in letting oil prices remain low because the government has large financial reserves and low debt that could help it ride out budget deficits. But there are dissenters, like Badr H. Jafar, a senior oil executive from the United Arab Emirates, who thinks Saudi Arabia will need higher oil prices eventually to support high levels of social spending.

He says the immediate strategy of the Saudis is to discourage high-cost producers in the United States and Canada and to “serve as an inherent warning to other producers in advance of an OPEC meeting next month that they will all need to make production cuts together if they are to curb this bearish trend.”

Others say the kingdom is facing lower prices no matter what it does because it cannot control the causes of the price dive, which include the drilling frenzy in North America and falling demand in Europe, Japan and much of the developing world. So it makes sense for the Saudis to defend their share of the global market, oil experts say.

“This is a war of economic necessity,” said Philip K. Verleger, president of PKVerleger, an energy consulting company.

That necessity primarily is a product of a 70 percent increase in United States oil production since 2008, which has cut imports from OPEC producers in half. Suddenly, Saudi and Nigerian crude that once flowed freely into the United States is competing for market share on Asian markets, where buyers are demanding lower prices. To make matters worse, the United States could be poised to become a major exporter over the next decade and cut further into Saudi markets.

Gary N. Ross, the chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, a New York-based consulting company, said that Saudi Arabia appeared to be applying lessons learned in the early 1980s, when it responded to a similar glut in the market by cutting production to keep the price up. That cost it valuable market share it later struggled to win back, he said.

This time, he said, Saudi Arabia is doing the opposite: accepting lower prices to keep its share of the market. And if that policy also happens to harm the kingdom’s rivals, so much the better.

“It is convenient that this is happening at a time when Iran is getting stronger and when Russia, a huge oil exporter, has been a thorn in the side by supporting Assad,” Mr. Ross said, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “But I don’t think you need a political motivation here.”

The drop in the world oil price could cut into Saudi Arabia’s growing effort to use its economic might and religious credentials as the home of Islam’s holiest sites to expand its influence across the Middle East.

It has recently supported campaigns against political Islamists in Egypt and elsewhere, bankrolled rebels seeking to topple Mr. Assad and sent tanks to help quell a political uprising in Bahrain lead by that kingdom’s Shiite majority against its Sunni rulers.

Saudi Arabia has also joined the American-led military coalition to fight the Islamic State, the jihadist group that has seized territory in Iraq and Syria.

Underpinning many of Saudi Arabia’s struggles is its rivalry with the Shiite powerhouse Iran for influence across the Arab and Muslim worlds.

Lower oil prices would increase the economic strain on Iran, which is already struggling under international sanctions aimed at persuading it to give up its nuclear program. They are also likely to hurt Russia, which has proved to be among Mr. Assad’s most powerful foreign allies and his greatest defender in the United Nations, and which is also feeling the pain of economic sanctions over its Ukraine policies.

Such considerations cannot be far from the minds of Saudi decision makers, said Jean-François Seznec, a political economist at Georgetown University.

“It is really Iran who is getting hurt, and I am wondering to what extent the Saudis are not pursing the lower price to bring Iran to the bargaining table,” Mr. Seznec said.

Others, however, said that although lower prices may serve Saudi Arabia’s political ends, they were not driving its oil policy.

“I don’t think that Saudi Arabia is in the business of trying to manage global politics through oil policy,” said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, the former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. “That is a fiction.”","As Oil Prices Plummet, Saudi Arabia Faces a Test of Strategy",2014-10-16,"In an effort to prop up prices, officials have signaled a willingness to endure reduced profits rather than cut production, as they did to their later regret in the early 1980s.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/world/middleeast/as-oil-prices-plummet-saudi-arabia-faces-a-test-of-strategy.html
388,"With a fifth of the world’s oil reserves, Saudi Arabia is the leading player in OPEC and has great sway over any move by the cartel to raise prices by cutting production. Its refusal to support such steps despite dizzying price declines has prompted myriad theories about the Saudi royal family’s agenda, and Saudi officials have hinted that the country is happy to let the low prices punish rival producers who use more expensive shale-fracking techniques.

“They have almost total leverage,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who recently returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia.

“They have more breathing room than these other countries,” he said. “It’s like the difference between someone having a million dollars in the bank and someone who is living paycheck to paycheck.”

The drop in oil prices has been felt in Saudi Arabia, but the country’s vast oil reserves and accumulated wealth give it a far greater cushion than other oil-producing nations have. Saudi Arabia needs the price of oil to be over $100 a barrel to cover its federal spending, including a lavish budget for infrastructure projects. The current price is about $55 a barrel, and Saudi Arabia has projected a 2015 deficit of about $39 billion.

But the monarchy has about $733 billion in savings invested in low-risk assets abroad, and it can afford to dip into that for a few years without much pain. Russia and Iran have no such luxury, and neither do shale-fracking oil producers in North America.

The Saudis have offered economic enticements to Russian leaders in return for concessions on regional issues like Syria before, but never with oil prices so low. It is unclear what effect, if any, the discussions are having. While the United States would support initiatives to end Russian backing for Mr. Assad, any success by the Saudis to cut production and raise global oil prices could hurt many parts of the American economy.

After the meeting in Moscow in November between Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Lavrov rejected the idea that international politics should play a role in setting oil prices.

“We see eye to eye with our Saudi colleagues in that we believe the oil market should be based on the balance of supply and demand,” Mr. Lavrov said, “and that it should be free of any attempts to influence it for political or geopolitical purposes.”

Russia is feeling financial pain and diplomatic isolation because of international sanctions stemming from its incursion into Crimea and eastern Ukraine, American officials said. But Mr. Putin still wants to be viewed as a pivotal player in the Middle East. The Russians hosted a conference last week in Moscow between the Assad government and some of Syria’s opposition groups, though few analysts believe the talks will amount to much, especially since many of the opposition groups boycotted them. Some Russia experts expressed skepticism that Mr. Putin would be amenable to any deal that involved removing support for Mr. Assad.

“It would be a huge change, and to me, this is an unlikely scenario,” said Angela E. Stent, a Russia specialist at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service and a former senior national intelligence officer who focused on Russia.

Saudi Arabia’s leverage depends on how seriously Moscow views its declining oil revenue. “If they are hurting so bad that they need the oil deal right away, the Saudis are in a good position to make them pay a geopolitical price as well,” said F. Gregory Gause III, a Middle East specialist at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service.

For his part, Mr. Assad has shown no inclination to step aside. He said in a recent interview with Foreign Affairs magazine that the true threat in Syria came from the Islamic State and Qaeda-affiliated groups that, in his words, make up a “majority” of the rebellion.

American and Arab officials said that even if Russia were to abandon Mr. Assad, the Syrian president would still have his most generous benefactor, Iran. Iranian aid to the Syrian government has been one of the principal reasons that Mr. Assad has been able to hold power as other autocrats in the Middle East have been deposed.

And as a major oil producer, Iran would benefit if Saudi Arabia helped push up oil prices as part of a bargain with Russia.

“You are going to strengthen your enemy whether you like it or not, and the Iranians are not showing any flexibility here,” said Mustafa Alani, an analyst at the Gulf Research Center who is close to the Saudi royal family.

But the military aid that Russia provides to Syria is different enough from what Damascus receives from Iran, its other major supplier, that if “Russia withdrew all military support, I don’t think the Syrian Army could function,” a senior Obama administration official said.

A number of Arab nations have been pushing for the Saudis and Russians — polar extremes in their positions toward Mr. Assad — to find common ground on the matter as a step toward ending the carnage of Syria’s civil war, now almost four years old.

400,"The total backlog of unfilled orders for Boeing and Airbus stands at more than 12,000 aircraft, valued at close to $2 trillion and enough to keep their assembly lines humming for more than eight years.

And the plane makers continued to pad their already hefty order books in 2014. Airbus said on Tuesday that it secured purchase contracts for a net 1,456 jets last year, down slightly from 1,503 planes in 2013, and that it delivered 629 in 2014. Last week, Boeing reported 1,432 net orders in 2014, up from 1,355 a year earlier, and 723 plane deliveries for the year — an industry record.

Boeing and Airbus each control roughly half the market for airliners with more than 100 seats.

Gains in fuel efficiency have topped the manufacturers’ lists of selling points for their newest generation of commercial jets. They include recently upgraded versions of short-range workhorses like the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, as well as lightweight, wide-bodied models made from carbon fiber like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner or the Airbus A350, which will formally enter service with its first customer, Qatar Airways, this week.

But forecasts suggest that oil prices, which have fallen by more than half over the last six months, to less than $50 a barrel, will be significantly lower this year than in recent years.

In a short-term energy outlook published Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration in Washington slashed its 2015 outlook for the average price of Brent, the international benchmark for crude, to $58 a barrel, compared with an average of $94 in 2014 and $98 in 2013.

The main factors behind the drop in oil prices, economists say, are a sharp increase in production by non-OPEC producers like the United States and other new sources, and slowing economic growth in some parts of the world — particularly Asia, the fastest-growing region for air traffic.

Weaker growth, in addition to the influx of new planes and a flood of new low-cost players in the air travel market, has already translated into a glut of available airline seats in parts of Asia, driving down ticket prices there.

“You are beginning to see the effects of overcapacity on airline profitability,” said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, a brokerage firm in London. While the wave of airline mergers in the United States has made this trend less apparent there, he said, the tendency is growing more pronounced in the rest of the world.

“You can’t keep on adding capacity without bankrupting the industry,” Mr. Cunningham said.

Falling oil prices may exacerbate the overcapacity problem by tempting airlines to lower fares in an effort to increase market share, said Adam M. Pilarski, an economist and senior vice president at Avitas, an aviation consulting firm in Chantilly, Va. That not only reduces the cash that airlines have available to pay for new planes they have ordered, he said, but also increases the odds that financially shaky carriers will delay or cancel orders — or not survive long enough to take delivery of their jets.

“Manufacturers know that when they sell a plane today for delivery in nine years, by then the environment might change,” Mr. Pilarski said. “The airline may change its mind, or it might not even be in business anymore.”

Last month, Airbus filed a lawsuit against Skymark, a struggling Japanese budget carrier that canceled a $2 billion order for six A380 superjumbo passenger jets in July. Airbus’s claim, filed in a British court, seeks unspecified damages. The plane maker has not said whether it has found another buyer for the jets.

Such cancellations have so far been rare. But some analysts worry that a sustained drop in oil prices could prompt some airlines to defer delivery of new planes, as it reduces the incentive to replace older fuel-guzzlers, at least in the near term.

“Let’s say you are an airline and you had a plan to replace a certain number of planes this year because they are really expensive to operate,” Mr. Pilarski said. “Suddenly, these costs go down substantially, and you say, ‘Now I can wait another year or two.’”

He continued: “In the short term, I would expect to see a decline in retirements.”

Any prolonged slowdown in the overall replacement rate could put the brakes on Boeing and Airbus delivery rates, analysts said. A study published last year by Ascend, an aviation consultancy based in London, found that about 50 percent of all new jet deliveries over the past five years had been for replacement purposes rather than growth, up from a long-term average of 43 percent since 1990.

Despite the prospect of a sustained period of lower fuel prices, plane makers are showing few signs of concern.

“They may decide to hold on to older planes a little longer,” Darren Hulst, Boeing’s director for market analysis, said of airlines. “But they will still need new aircraft to continue to grow and take advantage of the tailwinds in the operating cost environment.”

Referring to the lower projected fuel usage of coming jets like the Boeing 737 MAX or the A320neo, he added: ""20 percent savings is 20 percent, no matter where the oil price settles.”

Fabrice Brégier, the chief executive of Airbus, said on Tuesday that with oil prices impossible to predict, airlines would be wise to keep buying aircraft with lower fuel consumption. But he also emphasized that Airbus could weather any decline in orders.

“We have almost 6,400 aircraft in the backlog,” Mr. Brégier said at the company’s headquarters in Toulouse, France. “So we could, in principle, even sustain no orders for three to four years.”

That is a view shared by some airline executives, who say their fleet investments will not be swayed by a short-term drop in oil prices. Over the past year, for example, Ryanair, one of Boeing’s largest and fastest-growing customers, placed orders for 275 of Boeing’s new 737s for delivery through 2024, with an option to buy 100 more.

“I don’t worry too much about the short-term fluctuations in fuel,” Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, told analysts in November.

Although he conceded that lower fuel bills on its existing fleet of 300 planes had lessened the operating cost advantage of new planes “around the edges,” Mr. O’Leary emphasized that investing in a more fuel-efficient fleet now “is a huge unit cost advantage for us in five years’ time that nobody else will have.”","Falling Oil Prices, a Boon to Airlines, Pose a Challenge for Airbus and Boeing",2015-01-14,"The plane makers, which control the market for jets with more than 100 seats, have been riding a wave of demand for fuel-efficient models.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/business/international/falling-oil-prices-a-boon-to-airlines-pose-a-challenge-for-airbus-and-boeing.html

402,"Even though lower prices will hurt oil producers in the United States, the American economy will probably benefit as consumers have more money to spend and companies’ energy bills decline. Europe and Japan, both large oil importers, are also likely to get a boost from lower prices, although in Europe high taxes on energy limit gains for consumers.

Lower prices, on the other hand, could be very painful for OPEC producers, who depend heavily on oil revenue.

Some of the world’s largest exporters of oil, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, are members of OPEC. The group meets at least a couple of times a year, usually in Vienna, where the organization has its headquarters, but sometimes more often to discuss and try to manage the global oil markets.

While Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have each stashed away hundreds of billions of dollars in savings to buffer the effects of lower prices, Iran, Algeria and Venezuela, for example, will struggle to finance their government budgets at current price levels, according to a recent study by Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics.

Venezuela and some other producers badly wanted a cut to prop up prices and will be bitterly disappointed by the meeting’s outcome.

Analysts say that Thursday’s announcement signals a radical change on the part of OPEC. Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the market research IHS firm, called the announcement “a major tactical shift.” For decades OPEC has intervened to manage oil prices, cutting production when necessary. “Now they are defending volume and letting the rest take care of itself,” he said.

Analysts say that at least some OPEC powers appear to have recognized that lower prices may prevail for a considerable time. In that situation, the organization needs to work on regaining market share.

While exports of crude oil from the United States are still restricted, the surge in output is being felt on global markets as a result of the increased export of refined petroleum products like gasoline.

American imports from OPEC and elsewhere have also been sharply reduced, forcing OPEC producers to compete for the remaining markets in Asia and Europe. Iran, for instance, is storing as much as 100,000 barrels a day on tankers because it is unable to find markets.

Analysts say the surge in supply from the United States poses particular challenges to OPEC because there is little the producers’ group can do but hope that lower prices will eventually discourage investment in drilling in the United States, thus reducing production.

The dynamic has shades of the early 1980s, when new crude supplies emerged from the North Sea, Alaska and Mexico, sending prices falling and squeezing OPEC’s market share.

“OPEC faces its greatest threat since the early 1980s,” said Mr. Bahree, the analyst.

This divide between the countries that can endure low prices and those whose economic needs are more pressing is probably affecting OPEC’s efforts to come up with a response to the declining price.

Despite an effort to maintain a calm front, there were signs of frustration. During the traditional session with reporters at the beginning of Thursday’s meeting the Saudi oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi, angrily shooed away reporters and refused to answer questions.

Mr. Naimi had apparently grown weary of being surrounded by reporters as he tried to make his way through the lobby of Vienna’s Grand Hotel, which serves as a kind of informal headquarters for OPEC meetings because the Saudis and other OPEC delegates always stay there.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Naimi, an important figure in OPEC because of Saudi Arabia’s dominant role and his own long tenure, has been in Vienna since Monday, meeting with other producers from both inside and outside the organization in an effort to devise a unified response.

Igor Sechin, the chief of Russia’s state-controlled Rosneft, met with Mr. Naimi to discuss cutting production, but no agreement was reached. OPEC officials had high hopes that Russia might join the organization in cutting production.

OPEC may be facing a prolonged period of weak markets for its crude. IHS forecasts that the growth of supply outside of OPEC next year will exceed global demand growth, leaving no room for OPEC countries to increase their production.

At least for the time being, OPEC appears to have decided it will be too difficult to negotiate the production cuts with individual members that analysts say are necessary to have a strong impact on the market. OPEC has not had individual production quotas since 2011, when it agreed to operate on the basis of group output targets rather than individual limits. Restoring quotas is likely to be a lengthy and difficult exercise because the quotas are matters of prestige and economic power.

Several OPEC countries have the potential to increase their production. Iraq has ambitions to greatly increase above its present three million barrels a day, and its officials insist that they have the right to make up for decades of lost output and should not be bound by OPEC limits. Iran, too, could eventually greatly lift output if international sanctions are lifted.

OPEC may be retaining the informal system of recent years, in which Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have adjusted production according to market conditions. These countries have benefited from the political turmoil, sanctions and other problems that have curtailed production in countries like Iran, Venezuela and Libya.",OPEC Holds Production Unchanged; Prices Fall ,2014-11-28,The 30 percent decline in oil prices in recent months has shaken the solidarity of the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/28/business/international/opec-leaves-oil-production-quotas-unchanged-and-prices-fall-further.html

LONDON — The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries issued a report on Thursday that downgraded demand for its crude for 2015, while also predicting slower oil-production growth in the United States.

The report, which was prepared by the cartel’s economists at its headquarters in Vienna, said that demand for OPEC crude would be 28.8 million barrels a day this year, 100,000 barrels a day less than it forecast in its previous monthly market report, in December.

The report also said that demand for OPEC’s crude would average less than 28 million barrels a day in the first half of this year.

OPEC, a group of 12 oil-producing nations with Saudi Arabia as the linchpin, showed no sign of cutting production from the average of about 30 million barrels a day in 2014. Its forecasts imply an oversupply of more than 2 million barrels a day in the first half of this year.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, closed down more than 2 percent on Thursday, at $47.67 after a drop of $1.02, and the United States benchmark dropped more than 4 percent, to $46.25 after a drop of $2.24. Oil prices have plummeted roughly 60 percent since June.

Worries about a glut of oil in the first half of this year are a crucial factor depressing oil prices. The International Energy Agency, based in Paris, whose forecasts are closely followed by market participants, also foresees demand for OPEC crude in the first half’s being substantially below the organization’s current production, but by less than OPEC’s forecasts.

The impact of lower prices is rippling through the oil industry. BP said on Thursday that it had informed its North Sea staff that it would be cutting about 200 employees and 100 contractors. Royal Dutch Shell on Wednesday said it would be scrapping plans for an estimated $6.5 billion petrochemical project in Qatar that was a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum.

Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in London, said that the current oil industry could not function with prices in the range of $50 a barrel.

“People know these prices are unsustainable,” he said, and they will lead to large-scale layoffs and cuts in maintenance spending, which will eventually sharply reduce overall output. BP’s announcement of layoffs was just the start, he said.

He added that the prospect of “colossally huge inventory buildups” in the coming months would still most likely halt rallies in prices for the time being.

In its report, OPEC also said that the slump in prices since June was beginning to have an impact on production in the United States, where the shale oil industry has been the main source of the new supplies, which have put pressure on prices.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

The group said that it expected lower prices, reduced drilling and other factors to trim oil production growth in the United States by almost half compared with 2014, to about 950,000 barrels a day compared with an increase of about 1.6 million barrels a day in 2014. The United States Energy Information Administration, a government organization, also said recently that output growth would slow in 2015.

OPEC leaders like the Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi have said that production cuts should come from higher-cost producers like shale oil companies in the United States rather than from OPEC members, whose production costs are often low. Mr. Naimi said recently that Saudi Arabia’s output costs were no higher than $10 a barrel.

By contrast, operating costs in the British North Sea average about $25 a barrel, with some fields much higher.

Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm based in London, said that the OPEC and Energy Information Administration reports were likely to be the first in a series of incremental downgrades of output forecasts for the United States if the low-price environment persisted.

Analysts at BNP Paribas in London suggested in a research note published Thursday that American shale companies may not be OPEC’s primary target. The shale industry will be hard to shut down, they wrote, because “any modest price increase is likely to attract back capital to the sector.”

Instead, OPEC may be hoping to discourage investment in new deepwater projects in places like Brazil, Gabon and East Africa “that have high upfront capital costs and long lead times before the first barrel of oil is produced,” they wrote.

415,"The Lithuanian government gave final approval for the project in 2010.

Ms. Grybauskaite, who previously said that local companies and lawmakers with links to Gazprom and other Russian businesses meddled in the liquefied natural gas project, said on Monday that more energy independence could have been achieved sooner had there been greater political will in Lithuania.

Lithuanian officials say they had already pushed Russia into bargaining — something it has long resisted — when Gazprom cut its gas prices by about 20 percent in May.

“Consumers are already feeling lower prices of gas” as “a natural outcome of our terminal construction,” Rokas Masiulis, the Lithuanian energy minister, told reporters on Monday. The price that Lithuania was paying for liquefied natural gas was in “a very similar range” to the lower Gazprom price, he said.

The first shipment of liquefied natural gas, set to arrive on Tuesday from the Norwegian company Statoil, is equivalent to 60 million cubic meters of natural gas. Further shipments from Statoil should reach the equivalent of 540 million cubic meters annually in the next five years. That is a fifth of Lithuania’s needs.

Lithuania says the terminal, the only operation of its kind in the region, could become a beachhead to supply most of the needs of the other two Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia, which also rely on Russia for gas.

Even so, the company managing the project, Klaipedos Nafta, the state-controlled oil terminal operator, has not yet sold the majority of the liquefied natural gas terminal’s capacity — one of the factors that raise the important question of whether the terminal makes economic as well as political sense.

“Next year will show very real interest for the terminal,” said Mr. Masiulis, the energy minister.

Another challenge for the project would be if Gazprom dropped prices to Lithuania to the point that running the terminal became uneconomical.

Gazprom shrugged off the arrival of the vessel.

“If Lithuanian consumers are willing to pay more to reduce their dependence, it’s their business,” a spokesman, Sergei Kupriyanov, said by email.

The vessel was built in South Korea for the Norwegian company Hoegh, which is leasing it to Klaipedos Nafta under an arrangement that gives the Lithuanians the right to buy it after a decade.

Lithuania is spending 448 million euros, or $568 million, for construction, maintenance and a 10-year lease on the floating terminal, including financing for state-backed loans, said Mantas Bartuska, the chief executive of Klaipedos Nafta.

The vessel, which is three soccer fields in length and formally known as a floating gas storage and regasification unit, could not have been more timely for Lithuanians. The country of about three million people was the first former Soviet republic to reclaim its political independence. This year, Lithuania received approval to join the eurozone on Jan. 1, 2015. But it has waited 25 years to regain some control over its energy, which is a major expense for Lithuanian households and businesses.

In the past, Lithuania paid more than its Baltic neighbors for Russian gas. Lithuania also says it feels more exposed than Latvia, which has gas storage facilities, and Estonia, which has shale oil resources. Gazprom had an ownership stake in Lithuania’s natural gas distribution network until this summer and part of Lithuania’s electrical infrastructure is still controlled from Moscow.

Before the arrival of the vessel, Lithuanian commentators warned of the potential for Russian sabotage, and parts of the port were locked down Monday for its arrival. Linas Linkevicius, the Lithuanian foreign minister, suggested on his Twitter account on Oct. 19 that reports of a lost submarine in Swedish waters represented a “weird coincidence” when the liquefied natural gas vessel was crossing the Baltic Sea.

Lithuanians continue to complain that the West has underestimated the dangers posed by Russia, which has an enclave in Kaliningrad, on the border with Lithuania, where Russia keeps a naval base.

For analysts like Jonathan Stern of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, the project comes at the right time for Lithuania, partly because liquefied natural gas prices are expected to ease over the next two years.

“One of the most interesting questions is when the long-term contracts run out in Lithuania next year,” Mr. Stern said, referring to Gazprom’s sales agreements. “Will the Lithuanians say they do not want to extend the contracts” because it is “geopolitically unacceptable to depend on Russian gas at all?”",Lithuania Offers Example of How to Break Russia&#8217;s Grip on Energy,2014-10-28,A floating factory for converting liquefied natural gas into the burnable variety represents a direct challenge to the Russian way of doing business.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/business/energy-environment/lithuania-offers-example-of-how-to-break-russias-grip-on-energy.html

ANCHORAGE — This city often walks with a swagger as the metropolis of America’s far north, the high-rises of its oil-based economy glittering against a backdrop of mountain peaks and the ocean inlet named for Capt. James Cook, the English explorer. While Anchorage still occasionally glances south for approval, or for signs of a slight, it has recently carved a place of its own, residents say, with exciting art, dining and theater scenes, and job opportunities that go beyond energy.

The great question now is whether maturity and diversity will provide shelter from the economic storm barreling fast in the city’s way.

Six months of falling oil prices have come with some bitter and frightening memories of Anchorage in the mid-1980s, when the wild economic party ushered in by the Trans Alaska Pipeline shut down. The 800-mile pipe, from the northern oil wells of Prudhoe Bay to the shipping port of Valdez, had been completed in 1977 and was in its first gusher phase then until a price collapse not unlike the current one brought it all to a whooshing end.

The scars lasted years, in vacant homes and shops, in closed banks, and in the demographic crater left by the many departing Alaskans — dreamers and seekers, drawn north like the Klondike gold miners of the 1890s — who felt that the Last Frontier had failed them.

Now, even some people too young or too recently arrived to remember those dark days say they are worried. About 41 percent of Alaska’s population of 735,000 lives in the Anchorage area.

“Gas prices going down are, to me, a red flag,” said Erica Wynn, who works for the city’s Office of Equal Opportunity and was sipping coffee in a downtown cafe on a recent morning, as the temperature hovered just below zero. Ms. Wynn, 24, said that watching the sinking numbers on the gas pump has been fun, but it also fills her with deep unease. “It seems like a good thing, but I don’t think it is,” she said.

The similarities between the mid-1980s and the present start and end with oil prices and taxes. More than half of state tax revenues for this year have disappeared from the state budget in recent months, as they are linked to taxes on oil companies, which are now earning less. This has led Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, to propose cuts of 5 to 8 percent across most state agencies, and the elimination of more than 300 state jobs, with a worst-case possibility of 25 percent reductions in some agencies over the next three to five years.

The University of Alaska, a major economic force in Anchorage with about 20,000 students, faced budget cuts last year from the state even before the oil price crash, and is braced for more. The big oil companies, while avoiding sizable layoffs so far, are squeezing suppliers. A project to repair and renovate the Port of Anchorage and a second one to construct a bridge connecting downtown to a suburb across the Knik Arm of Cook Inlet, which are both ardently hoped-for stabilizers to the economy, are now delayed because most state capital spending projects are frozen in place.

But optimists have fuel too.

Economic sectors that benefit from low energy prices, especially tourism and commercial fishing, are far bigger now than they were in the 1980s. The city also has a heft and reach it did not have then: it is connected to the economies of the world in ways it never was before, with one of the nation’s busiest airfreight hubs linking exporters and importers for balletic trades on the northern fly route between Asia and the markets of North America. And the state government has savings, built up in the last few years, that could help avoid the drastic cuts that badly hurt the economy last time.

“It’s too early to panic,” said Bill Popp, the president and chief executive of the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation. But, he added, “It’s also a time to be choosing our steps very carefully.”

Mr. Popp said he believes a more mature Anchorage — a city founded only 100 years ago — will take some hits, but avoid catastrophe. Yet he noted that decisions made in a climate of fear, such as reduced spending by households or businesses, could hurt the city and become self-fulfilling.

Some small businesses have been paring back expenses and payroll, but not by choice. Beacon Occupational Health and Safety Service, for example, a business in Anchorage started by Mark and Holly Hylen in 1999 that has grown to about 300 employees, contracts with several oil companies that are spending less and pushing that down the chain, said Mr. Hylen, the firm’s vice president. Beacon had to cut 24 employees’ pay last year in a contract change for oil field safety services, and about 12 of those people quit.

“Everybody is looking at ways to be more efficient,” said Mr. Hylan. “The pressure intensifies.”

The recent decision by the Obama administration to seek federal wilderness protection for millions of acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the state’s northeast corner, which would take those lands off the table for oil or gas drilling, also sends a bad signal in a scary time, oil industry officials said. In the expensive projects in the state’s far north, political fears might provide excuses to pull back, said Kara Moriarty, the president and chief executive of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.

“In this price environment, those projects are on the margin to begin with,” she said, referring to drilling sites above the Arctic Circle. “Now to put further restrictions, it sends a signal that Alaska is not open for business.”

Part of the economic calculus is that Anchorage is also the state’s marketplace for goods bought by other Alaskans, who by and large pass through on their way to smaller cities or rural villages. And the rest of the state lacks the diversified economy of Anchorage, making those places more vulnerable to the impact of cuts in state spending or revenue sharing.

“What’s good for rural Alaska is good for Anchorage,” said Anchorage’s mayor, Dan Sullivan. “It’s a symbiotic relationship.”",Matured Anchorage Struggles to Shake Haunting Memories ,2015-02-09,"Falling oil prices have come with bitter and frightening memories of the Alaskan city in the mid-1980s, when the wild economic party ushered in by the Trans Alaska Pipeline shut down.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/us/matured-anchorage-struggles-to-shake-old-fears.html

HONG KONG — Fosun International, the Chinese investment group that likens itself to Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, announced on Monday that it was making its first push into the oil and natural gas business, with a $441 million bid for Roc Oil of Australia.

Fosun is seeking to derail a rival, all-stock deal announced in April that would merge Roc with another Australian company, Horizon Oil. The Chinese group’s cash bid of 69 Australian cents a share values Roc at 474 million Australian dollars, or $441 million.

Fosun’s offer is contingent on the Horizon deal not going through, and it has already won support from Roc’s board, which said on Monday in a stock exchange announcement that it had “unanimously concluded that the offer is a superior option and a low-risk route to maximize immediate value for our shareholders.”

Buying Roc would give Fosun control of its oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in China, Malaysia and Australia. Last year, Roc produced about 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, a common volume metric in the oil and gas industry, and earned a net profit of $45.2 million.

The deal would also broaden the reach of Fosun’s industrial investments, which are concentrated in China and include steel making, iron ore mining, drug manufacturing and real estate development.

Fosun has been expanding internationally in areas like retailing, resorts and insurance, and in recent years it has acquired stakes in the Greek fashion label Folli Follie, the French resort operator Club Méditerranée and the Portuguese insurer Caixa Seguros e Saúde.

Fosun’s offer is 10 percent above Roc’s closing price on Friday and 52 percent more than where it traded on April 23, before the merger with Horizon was made public. Shares in Roc rose 7.1 percent on Monday in Sydney after the deal was announced, and they closed at 67.5 cents.",Chinese Group Fosun International Bids $441 Million for Roc Oil of Australia,2014-08-04,"Fosun International’s bid, which seeks to defeat a rival offer from an Australian energy company, already has the support of the Roc board.",http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/chinese-group-bids-441-million-for-roc-oil-of-australia/

When gasoline topped $4 a gallon, opponents of an increase in the gas tax argued that prices were already too high.

Now the average price of regular gas has dropped under $2.50 a gallon, but in the antitax environment that pervades Washington there is still scant support for increasing the gas tax to finance upkeep of the nation’s roadways and public transit systems.

The no-win dynamic is frustrating to advocates who hoped falling gas prices might reinvigorate the idea of raising the gas tax, which they view as one of the simplest, fairest and most efficient ways to pay for transportation repairs and improvements.

“If something like this is going to be done, now is the time to do it,” said Bob Corker, a Republican senator, who noted that gas prices in his home state of Tennessee fell below $2 a gallon this month. Senator Corker and Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, unveiled a proposal in June to raise the gas tax by 12 cents a gallon over the next two years and then index further increases to inflation.

The latest discussions about raising the gas tax come as the Energy Information Administration estimates that the average American household will spend at least $550 less on gasoline next year than it did in 2014, a result of lower prices and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks that can travel farther on fewer gallons.

“Annual motor fuel expenditures are on track to fall to their lowest level in 11 years,” the agency reported.

The Gas Tax Although the price of gasoline has fluctuated greatly since the 1930s, the gas tax has remained very modest. Average annual price of gas vs. gas tax $4 a gallon 2014 AVG. adjusted for inflation Price $3.37 $3 $2 nominal $1 Tax 0.18 0 1930 ’40 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10

“There’s a huge supply shock right now,” Doug Peterson, president and chief executive of McGraw Hill Financial, said recently at a panel discussion on financing infrastructure at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. With prices at the pump dropping by more than $1 a gallon, he noted, the government could collect a few cents on every gallon and still leave consumers with more money in their wallets. “I think this is an opportunity that we have,” Mr. Peterson said, “to see if we could get a gas tax through.”

The last time the gasoline tax was raised was in 1993, and even that 4.3-cent-a-gallon increase was not initially dedicated to transportation repair and capital improvements, but rather was part of President Clinton’s budget-deficit reduction plan. That revenue stream was redirected to the federal Highway Trust Fund in 1997.

Back then, the 18.4-cent tax on every gallon represented about 16 percent of the pump price, said Aaron Klein, director of the Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Treasury Department official. If the gas tax had kept pace with inflation it would be 30.1 cents today, he said.

A result is that the trust fund is facing an estimated $160 billion deficit over the next 10 years. When efforts at a long-term fix failed over the summer, Congress approved a last-minute patch that avoided throwing out of a job as many as 700,000 people working on transportation projects around the country. But that back-from-the-brink agreement, which funneled $11 billion to the fund, covers the shortfall only through May.

For some conservative members of Congress, bankruptcy of the highway fund is just what they want, arguing that state and local governments should bear principal responsibility for highways and bridges.

That persistent resistance has even led some proponents of the gas tax to admit defeat.

“I think it’s time to acknowledge the funding mechanism is just broken,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the head of the American Action Forum, a conservative advocacy group, and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

There are alternatives: selling bonds, creating more private-public partnerships, taxing the miles a vehicle travels or its weight or, in the future, instituting a carbon tax, which is favored by many economists along the political spectrum and has found support among some environmentalists as a way of reducing damaging carbon emissions.

Some members of Congress have discussed taxing barrels of oil instead of gallons at the pump, although that would transform the gas tax from a user fee to a broader-based tax on home heating oil, farmers and manufacturers.

In the absence of a workable fee, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that it might even be time to consider “the most radical option” and put infrastructure costs into the general budget, “and force it to compete on a level playing field with other needs.”

But that idea is an anathema to many supporters. “A gas tax is what we really need to do,” said Janet Kavinoky, executive director for transportation and infrastructure at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, explaining that alternatives like a miles-traveled tax are probably viable in the future, but are not ready yet.

Ms. Kavinoky said that many members of Congress supported the idea of a gas tax in private, but feared retribution if they supported it publicly. “It’s just politically not a very popular solution,” she said.

Senator Corker, who has tried to appease deficit hawks by proposing to reduce other taxes in exchange for a rise in the gas tax, said his plan would probably get caught up in negotiations about broader tax reform when the Republicans take control of both houses.

“The leadership is going to want the finance committee to come up with a larger package,” he said, adding that he was open to all sorts of options except a short-term fix. “The one thing I’m going to rail against is to kick the can down the road.”",Gasoline-Tax Increase Finds Little Support ,2015-01-03,"Advocates like Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee find it tough to penetrate Washington’s antitax mood, even as gas prices fall and federal transportation funds face huge deficits.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/business/energy-environment/support-for-gas-tax-increase-still-nil-despite-falling-prices.html

Three weeks before the midterm elections, voters are hearing about Ebola, jobs, threats in the Middle East and “invaders” at the border. What they are not hearing about are gas prices, which are plunging.

If prices at the pump were rising, the political clamor would be deafening, yet falling prices have barely produced a peep.

For nearly three straight weeks, the price of gasoline has been dropping daily, and at an average of $3.16 on Thursday, a gallon of regular unleaded was at the lowest level since the fall of 2010. That year, low prices reflected weak demand in a faltering economy, and that offered no silver lining to Democrats ahead of the Tea Party landslide. This time around, the driving force isn’t weak demand but supply — which is a-gushin’.

Hydraulic fracturing — or fracking — has turned the United States from an energy consumer to an exporter, transforming its economy and flooding a global market.

For President Obama, the silence is most likely maddening. After all, he told an audience this month in Evanston, Ill., that two years ago he pledged to cut oil imports in half by 2020, a goal the country actually met this year.

But Democrats, wary of a left flank that is not enamored with the fracking revolution, have not exactly been claiming credit.

Republicans, insistent that the Obama administration has held said revolution back, have let the trend go unmentioned.

Meantime, we at the gas pump can play the game “How Low Can You Go.” Some analysts say oil prices will slide another $10 a barrel.","Gas Prices Plunge, but the Candidates Don't Seem to Care",2014-10-17,"Gas prices are plunging, but the candidates aren’t talking about it.",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/17/gas-prices/

430,"In his heyday, Bunker Hunt owned five million acres of grazing land in Australia, 1,000 thoroughbreds on farms from Ireland to New Zealand, eight million acres of oil fields in Libya, offshore wells in the Philippines and Mexico, and an empire of skyscrapers, cattle ranches, mining interests and other holdings. Home was a French provincial mansion in a Dallas suburb and his 2,000-acre Circle T Ranch 30 miles out of town.

Often likened to Jett Rink, the antihero of Edna Ferber’s “Giant,” or the scheming J. R. Ewing of the long-running CBS television drama “Dallas,” he was a nonsmoking teetotaler who cultivated a devil-may-care Texas mystique by inhabiting cheap suits, a battered Cadillac, economy-class airline seats, burger and chili joints, and dusty barnyards in the raucous company of ranch hands.

He was an evangelical Christian close to the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and supported right-wing politicians and causes, including the John Birch Society. He loathed the federal government, warned of international communist conspiracies, spouted anti-Semitic sentiments, did business with the Saudi royal family and bankrolled expeditions to salvage the Titanic and to find Noah’s Ark.

After being pummeled by the silver debacle and further losses in oil and real estate, Mr. Hunt and his brothers took out loans to pay debts, then sold properties to repay the loans and placed many family holdings into bankruptcy, including the Placid Oil Company, the crown jewel of the Hunt financial empire. It was eventually sold, along with the homes, land, stables, art and coin collections, and other treasures.

In one lawsuit, a federal jury in Manhattan determined in 1988 that the Hunts had conspired with others in a racketeering enterprise to monopolize the silver market and ordered them to pay $130 million in damages to a Peruvian commodities concern. Bunker and Herbert were found most culpable, while Lamar, the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs football team, was assigned a lesser role.

As creditors closed in, the Hunts hemorrhaged money and defaulted on $1.5 billion in loans. They agreed to pay $90 million in back taxes over 15 years and $10 million each in fines levied by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which barred them from trading. In 1989, Bunker emerged from bankruptcy with assets of $5 million to $10 million and debts that stretched to the Pecos horizon.

But through the clever use of courts and trusts to protect assets, and of counterclaims and settlements to gain time and ease the pain, the Hunts for years carried on much as usual: Bunker exploring for oil abroad, attending the races and overseeing smaller thoroughbred stables; Herbert running real estate operations; Lamar focusing on his sports enterprises.

Like his siblings, Bunker still had millions in trusts set up by his father, and Forbes reported in 2001 that, while he had long ago dropped off the list of the richest Americans, he had recently bought 80 racehorses for $2.5 million, and that a filly called Hattiesburg, which he picked up for $20,000, had won $357,000.

“I don’t really know anything,” he said. “I am just trying to win a few races.”

Nelson Bunker Hunt was born in El Dorado, Ark., on Feb. 22, 1926, one of seven children of Haroldson Lafayette Hunt Jr. and Lyda Bunker Hunt. One girl died in infancy. H. L. Hunt had already struck oil riches, and by 1935 trust funds had been set up for Bunker; two sisters, Margaret and Caroline, and three brothers, William Herbert, Lamar and Haroldson III, who was known as Hassie and was incapacitated with mental illness.

It was not until years later that they discovered that their father had two other families: four children each with Ruth Ray and Frania Tye. In the ensuing internecine intrigues, all were given trust funds and some became beneficiaries of the patriarch’s will.

When Bunker was 12, his family moved to Dallas. He attended the University of Texas, joined the Navy in World War II and, after being discharged, attended Southern Methodist University. He worked with his father and brothers in the oil business for a time, then began his own ventures in cattle, horses and oil. He made $5 billion in Libya before Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi nationalized the oil fields.

In 1951, he married Caroline Lewis, who survives him. He is also survived by their son, Houston; their daughters, Ellen Hunt Flowers, Mary Hunt Huddleston and Betsy Hunt Curnes; his brother William Herbert Hunt; his sister Caroline Rose Hunt; 14 grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren. (Lamar Hunt died in 2006, Hassie Hunt in 2005 and Margaret Hunt Hill in 2007.)

As oil prices rose in the 1970s, the family’s wealth skyrocketed — as did inflation. The Hunts insisted that their pursuit of silver had merely been a hedge against inflation. Much of the hoard was bought on margin or financed with borrowed money.

By mid-January 1980 they owned or controlled such vast quantities of silver that they were reaping $100 million in paper profit with every $1 increase in the price.

Then the bubble burst.

After the market had collapsed and the family had been forced to put up billions in collateral, the oldest sister, Margaret, a dominant voice in family councils, confronted Bunker, demanding to know what he had intended to accomplish.

Wall Street initially followed the eurozone stock markets in rallying after the European Central Bank’s surprise announcement of a new stimulus program.

In addition to lifting stocks, the announcement caused the euro to drop against the dollar to its lowest level in more than a year. Europe’s single currency, which has been in retreat over the last few weeks on expectations of central bank stimulus measures, fell 1.5 percent, to $1.29 per euro.

Freddie Mac Yields Average for some Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. securities. 5 % 4 30-Year: 3.60% 3 15-Year: 2.74% 2 July June May Aug.

Hiring is also picking up and American businesses added jobs at a healthy pace in August, according to a private survey. It was the fifth consecutive month of solid gains. On Friday, the government will report on August employment. Economists were projecting that employers added at least 220,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate dipped to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent.

“The backdrop is looking pretty rosy for the U.S. economy, and we think that this could translate into corporate profits through stronger revenue,” said David M. Lebovitz, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

Despite the encouraging signs, the stock market started giving up its gains in afternoon trading on Thursday, before ending the day with a small loss.

Energy stocks were the biggest drag on the market, sagging to their biggest one-day loss in a month as the price of oil slumped. The S.&P. 500’s energy sector dropped 1.3 percent, while crude oil for October delivery dropped $1.09, or 1.1 percent, to $94.45 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Oil prices fell after government data showed that American supplies declined less than expected last week. Among the stocks on the moves, PVH was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The company, which owns the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, surged $11.25, or 9.6 percent, to $128.30, after reporting earnings that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.

The turmoil in the energy sector weighed on Apollo Global Management in the last three months of 2014, as the private equity giant reported sharply lower profit.

Apollo said on Thursday that its economic net income after taxes — a profit measure that includes unrealized investment gains or losses — declined 79 percent in the fourth quarter, to $93.8 million, from the period a year earlier. On a per-share basis, the profit amounted to 23 cents a share, falling short of the 32 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.

Underpinning the lackluster results were declines in Apollo’s investments in energy, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One major holding, EP Energy, the publicly traded oil and gas company in which Apollo owns a roughly 23 percent stake, experienced a 40 percent decline in its stock price during the fourth quarter.

Although that loss and others were not realized, they still had a significant effect on Apollo’s investment profit, which takes unrealized moves into account. Factoring in cash profits from investments as well as unrealized losses, Apollo reported a so-called carried interest loss of $5 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a $526.8 million profit in the period a year earlier.

Apollo’s private equity segment, usually a powerful profit generator, reported that economic net income fell 87 percent, to $40 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The segment’s carried interest income amounted to just $20.6 million, 95 percent lower than a year earlier.

The firm said its private equity funds appreciated by less than 1 percent in the quarter.

Apollo is hardly alone in experiencing pain because of investments in the oil industry. A range of energy companies backed by private equity firms have suffered as oil prices, after peaking last June, have collapsed.

But Apollo and its rivals are also trying to capitalize on the sector’s troubles. Apollo is quickly gathering capital for a new fund to buy the debt of troubled energy companies, according to a confidential email obtained by DealBook.

The firm’s credit business, too, suffered in the fourth quarter. Its economic net income fell 42 percent, to $93.3 million, from the period a year earlier, as it experienced investment losses.

Despite the troubles, Apollo continued to generate cash for its shareholders and the investors in its funds. Its distributable earnings, a profit measure reflecting the cash that can be given to shareholders, amounted to $374.4 million, 26 percent lower than the period a year earlier. The firm declared a dividend of 86 cents per share.

Apollo’s assets under management totaled $159.8 billion as of the end of the year, a slight decline from the level of $161.2 billion a year earlier.

Apollo and its rivals prefer to use nonstandard metrics to report results. According to generally accepted accounting principles, Apollo reported $22.2 million of net income in the fourth quarter, 86 percent lower than the period a year earlier.

“In 2014, Apollo continued to position itself for consistent long term growth, investment excellence and diversification,” Leon D. Black, the chief executive, said in a statement. Noting that his funds invested about $10 billion of capital during the year, he said he believed the investments “can generate meaningful future returns for our investors and shareholders.”",Profit at Private Equity Firm Apollo Falls Sharply on Energy Industry Turmoil,2015-02-05,Apollo Global Management’s economic net income after taxes — a profit measure that includes unrealized investment gains or losses — declined nearly 80 percent in the fourth quarter.,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/profit-at-private-equity-firm-apollo-falls-sharply-on-energy-industry-turmoil/

441,"The Dow Jones industrial average is closing more than 300 points lower, its worst loss in two months. Traders seemed to be discouraged Friday by another slump in the price of oil and more signs of weakness in China.

The Dow dropped 315 points, or 1.8 percent, to 17,280. The Dow had its first losing week since October.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,002. The Nasdaq slid 54 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,653.

Oil prices sank again after the International Energy Agency said global demand will grow less than previously forecast next year. Crude tumbled $2.14, or 3.6 percent, to $57.81 a barrel. It’s down 47 percent since June.

RIPPLE EFFECTS While the plunge in oil prices is good for consumers because it lowers prices at the gas pump, the slump is hitting energy companies hard. If low prices persist, some United States oil producers could go out of business as the cost of extracting oil exceeds its market price.

“The adverse impact of the oil price rout on oil-exporting economies looks likely to offset, if not exceed, the stimulus it could provide for oil-importing countries against a backdrop of weak economic growth and low inflation,” the agency said.

THE QUOTE The slump in oil has unsettled the market, putting it on track for its first weekly drop in eight weeks.

444,"LONDON — In response to the sharp fall in oil prices, the Italian oil company Eni said on Thursday that it was putting on hold its efforts to sell its stake in its drilling and oil field construction subsidiary, Saipem. Eni said it was reacting to market conditions that have become “increasingly volatile.”

The decline in oil prices of more than 40 percent in recent months is hitting oil services companies like Saipem particularly hard because their clients are scrambling to cut costs by halting projects and curtailing spending. Saipem’s stock price has fallen by more than 50 percent since the beginning of July, cutting the value of Eni’s 43 percent holding to about 1.6 billion euros.

Claudio Descalizi, who became chief executive of Eni this year, had wanted to sell the holding in Saipem as part of a plan to focus on Eni’s oil and gas businesses. Eni has been among the most successful of the large oil companies in recent years in finding new oil and gas, and these activities produce most of its profits.

Selling the Saipem stake was seen as a way of raising capital and streamlining Eni. Credit Suisse was brought in as a financial adviser on the potential sale, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Credit Suisse declined to comment.

Saipem had long been one of the top players in oil field contracting, providing services like well-drilling and pipe-laying with specialized ships in offshore oil and gas fields.

But Saipem’s reputation was tarnished when the company’s chief executive was forced out in late 2012 because of allegations of corruption in Algeria. Saipem was also hurt by the announcement this month by President Vladimir Putin of Russia that he was scrapping the giant South Stream project for bringing gas from Russia through Southern Europe and to focus on sending gas to Turkey instead.

Saipem had won contracts valued at 2.4 billion euros on the most complex part of South Stream, laying pipes under the Black Sea from Russia to Bulgaria. Saipem initially learned of the decision through the news media.",Eni Suspends Effort to Sell Its Stake in Oil Services Unit,2014-12-11,The decline in oil prices is hitting companies that provide services in oil fields particularly hard because their clients are scrambling to cut costs by halting projects and curtailing spending.,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/eni-suspends-effort-to-sell-its-stake-in-oil-services-unit/
445,"The stock market fell on Tuesday in a volatile session as traders were rattled by sudden twists in the price of oil and the Russian ruble.

The major indexes opened lower, but less than an hour later, crude oil recovered and oil and gas producers surged, driving the Dow Jones industrial average up as much as 246 points in the morning.

By the end of the day, however, those gains were gone.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended with a loss of 16.89 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,972.74. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 111.97 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,068.87, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 57.32 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,547.83.

The turbulence drove traders into the safety of United States bonds, driving prices up and yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note sank to 2.06 percent from 2.12 percent late Monday, a big move in what is normally a placid market. Its price rose 15/32, to 101 22/32.

The volatility is likely to last until oil prices find a stable floor, said Marc A. Zabicki, senior market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.

Since reaching a record high of 2,075.37 on Dec. 5, the S.&P. 500 has fallen into a slump, losing ground on six of the past seven trading days. Energy companies have been hit hard, a result of the oil slump. The S.&P. 500 has lost 4.6 percent so far this month. December, usually one of the market’s best months, has not lived up to its reputation.

Russia’s ruble, under pressure from lower oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow’s conflict with Ukraine, dropped 20 percent before recovering somewhat. That followed a move by Russia’s central bank to increase its benchmark interest rate to support the ruble.

The price of oil in the United States stabilized on Tuesday for the first time in a week. Crude oil for February delivery settled unchanged at $56.26 a barrel in New York. Oil has fallen by nearly half since June as demand wanes and supply climbs.

John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management, said the trouble in developing countries highlighted the stability of the American economy and its stock market.

“Yes, I do worry about Russia, yes I do worry about Venezuela, and you can’t really have oil come down more than 45 percent without somebody having a problem, somewhere,” Mr. Manley said. “But there’s an old saying on Wall Street, ‘In a dog-eat-dog market, get yourself a big dog,’ and the U.S. is the ultimate big dog when it comes to this sort of thing.”

There was little economic news to affect the stock market on Tuesday as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.

447,"LONDON – Shelf Drilling, a Dubai-based operator of oil rigs, is looking to become the latest company to cash in on a buoyant market for London stock offerings.

The company, which operates shallow-water drilling operations in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, India and parts of Africa, said on Thursday that it hoped to issue shares valued at a minimum of $500 million in an initial public offering later this year on the London Stock Exchange.

“Becoming a public company will further enable us to invest in the drilling services our customers seek and build sustainable, profitable growth in the world’s most prolific hydrocarbon-bearing shallow water basins,” said David Mullen, the Shelf Drilling chief executive.

The proposed listing comes in what has been a heady market for I.P.O.s in London, with more than 40 so far this year.

Still, concerns have risen in recent weeks that the market may be cooling somewhat.

Fat Face, a British retailer, recently pulled its proposed listing. Saga, a travel and insurance business aimed at people over 50, has been trading below its offer price since its listing in May.

And on Monday, Lloyds Banking Group set the pricing range for its TSB unit below what analysts believe is the book value for the business. Lloyds is being forced by European regulators to sell the business as part of the terms of its government bailout during the financial crisis, and the pricing reflects desire by Lloyds for a smooth float of the business.

On Thursday, Shelf Drilling said it would use proceeds from the offering to pay down its debt.

Following the I.P.O., Shelf Drilling also intends to adopt a policy of paying 40 percent to 60 percent of its net income as a dividend.

Named as chairman elect of Shelf Drilling is Richard Olver, the former chairman of the defense contractor BAE Systems and the former chief executive of the energy company BP.

Founded in 2012, Shelf Drilling has a fleet of 37 rigs, and contracts for two more that are under construction. The company posted profit of $232 million in 2013.

It has about 2,800 employees and 950 contract workers.

Tumbling oil prices are dimming one of the few big bright spots that banks have enjoyed since the financial crisis.

Banks have been lending hand over fist to companies in the nation’s energy industry, underwriting bonds, advising on mergers, even financing the building of homes for oil workers. All of this has provided a boon to banks that have been struggling to find more companies and consumers wanting to borrow.

Yet with the price of crude oil falling below levels sufficient for some energy companies to service their huge debts, strains are being felt and defaults are likely. While it may take some time for the crunch in the oil industry to translate into losses, one thing already seems clear: The energy banking boom is over.

“At the least, you are talking about a slowdown in loan growth for the banks in the energy-producing states,” said Charles Peabody, a banking specialist at Portales Partners. “That, we feel pretty strongly about.”

A Boon for Banks Lending, underwriting and advising on behalf of energy companies has been a strong business for North American banks. An expected slowdown as a result of falling oil prices may hurt banks’ revenue.

Mr. Peabody covered Texas banks in the 1980s, when a slump in the energy business helped cause large losses at the lenders, and banks to collapse or be rescued. He says he expects the current problems for energy companies to lead to losses, too.

“We do believe that you will start to see some defaults,” he said.

This week, as many of the largest banks report their earnings for the final three months of 2014, investors will press the banks for answers on how a sudden slump in the once-roaring oil and gas industry may hurt their bottom lines.

The expected slowdown comes as banks, both big and small, have finally dug out from the wreckage of the financial crisis and have been looking for new ways to bolster their revenues.

When times are good, the capital-intensive oil business is a banker’s dream. From new wells dug in North Dakota and Texas to the oil patch of Alberta, oil producers have turned to Wall Street and local banks to help them sell billions of dollars in bonds, raise equity and arrange lines of credit.

“It’s been a hot industry, probably a little too hot,” said Dick Evans, chief executive of Cullen/Frost Bankers of Texas, which has a relatively sizable energy practice. “But it is not time to panic. We have been in the game a long time. I am comfortable with what we have been doing.”

There is a flip side to lower oil prices that helps the banks, or at least those with large consumer businesses. The less cash consumers have to spend filling up their gas tanks or heating their homes, the more emboldened they may feel to sign up for a credit card or take out a mortgage.

“As consumers have more money in their pocket, surely that helps Wells Fargo,” the chief executive of that bank, John G. Stumpf, said at a financial services conference last month. “I would say net-net this is a good thing for the country.”

Still, if oil prices remain near $50 a barrel for long, economists and industry analysts expect a sharp deceleration in production this year, idling energy bankers and cutting into their lucrative fees.

Two of the banks that may be the hardest hit by lower investment-banking fees are among the biggest. Wells Fargo derived about 15 percent of its investment banking fee revenue last year from the oil and gas industry, while at Citigroup, the business accounted for roughly 12 percent, according to the data provider Dealogic.

At some of the larger banks in Canada, a slowdown in fees could be even more pronounced. At Scotiabank, about 35 percent of its investment banking revenue came from oil and gas companies last year.

And Wall Street firms that financed energy deals may now have trouble offloading some of the debt, as they had originally planned.

Morgan Stanley, for instance, led a group of banks that made $850 million of loans to Vine Oil and Gas, an affiliate of Blackstone, a private equity firm. Morgan Stanley is still trying to sell the debt, according to a person briefed on the transaction. Similarly, Goldman Sachs and UBS led a $220 million loan last year to the private equity firm Apollo Global Management to buy Express Energy Services. Not all the debt has been sold to other investors, according to people briefed on the transaction.

A precipitous drop in oil prices can quickly turn loans that once seemed safe and conservatively underwritten into risky assets.

The collateral underpinning many energy loans, for example, is oil that was valued at $80 a barrel at the time the loans were made. As oil has dropped well below that price in recent months, the value of the banks’ collateral has sunk.

Many oil companies have bought hedges on oil prices, which are providing lenders with additional cushion. But when those hedges expire, and if oil prices remain low, the banks may need to reserve money against the loans.

“At $50 a barrel, things can get a bit testy,” said Christopher Mutascio, a banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Some of the greater risks may be the loans the banks have extended to the many kinds of services companies that work in and around the oil industry. Some of these services companies, lured by the boom, may have short track records, analysts say.

Low oil prices can have ripple effects that many banks may not anticipate, particularly in states such as North Dakota and Oklahoma where energy is a large driver of the economy.

When oil prices crashed in the 1980s, many Texas banks failed not because of loans to oil producers, but because of loans to local real estate developers who had been caught in the energy bust.

Just over 20 percent of the loans at MidSouth Bank, based in Lafayette, La., are to oil and gas companies, a high proportion relative to its peers. But Rusty Cloutier, MidSouth’s chief executive, said the bank had focused its lending on services companies with seasoned management that were most likely prepared for a dip in activity.

“Our companies understand that they ride the crest, the up and the down,” Mr. Cloutier said. “We are not panicking.”

Mr. Stumpf of Wells Fargo also expressed confidence in his bank’s ability to weather a downturn. Energy loans make up about 2 percent of the bank’s loans.

“Some marginal producers will get challenged in this, but this is not something new to them,” he said last month. “Cycles like this happen, so industry will be able to work through this.”

Investors in the junk bond market — of which energy companies account for an estimated 18 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase — are not so optimistic.

Junk bonds issued by energy companies are signaling a jarring jump in the number of defaults in the coming months. Martin S. Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors, said the yields on energy junk bonds appeared to be predicting that 6 percent of the bonds would default this year, and even more in 2016.

“As far as the high-yield market is concerned, the energy sector is in a recession,” Mr. Fridson said.

450,"Oil prices plunged on Wednesday and took the stock market down with them. The three main market indexes fell 1.5 percent or more.

The catalyst for the latest sell-off in oil was a report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that projected demand for its crude would sink next year to levels not seen in more than a decade. Demand for OPEC’s oil has eroded as other countries, including the United States, have stepped up production.

The decline in the price of oil accelerated after the Energy Department reported that domestic oil inventories had increased by 1.5 million barrels last week. Analysts had expected a decline.

Crude oil for January delivery fell $2.88, or 4.5 percent, to settle at $60.94 a barrel in New York. The price of oil has now dropped more than 40 percent from a peak of $107 in June.

The wider fallout from the plunge in oil prices may be starting to worry investors. While lower oil prices are good for consumers and some industries, some producers may be forced out of business if prices continue to drop.

“The slide in oil has been pretty dramatic,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “There is an overreaction to these lower energy prices, which is what we seem to be seeing right now, where it becomes more panic selling.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 33.68 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,026.14. The decline was the biggest for the index since Oct. 13.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 268.05 points, or 1.5 percent, to 17,533.15. The Nasdaq composite index fell 82.44 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,684.03.

Falling oil prices and concerns about global growth have pushed stocks down sharply since they closed at record levels on Friday. The market rose that day after the government reported a jump in hiring in November that put the United States on track for the healthiest year for job creation since 1999.

The resilience of the American economy has prompted investors to speculate that the Federal Reserve will signal next week that it is nearing its first rate increase in more than eight years. The prospect of higher rates is unsettling for some investors as the market’s bull run of almost six years has come against a backdrop of unprecedented stimulus.

Federal Reserve policy makers are scheduled to convene a two-day meeting on Tuesday.

“The stronger employment data and economic data that we have gotten has only increased people’s confidence that the Fed is going to be raising rates” by the middle of next year, said Rob Eschweiler, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Houston.

The oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the biggest losers in the Dow. Exxon Mobil dropped $2.71, or 3 percent, to $88.67, while Chevron fell $2.15, or 2 percent, to $104.86. The S.&P. 500 energy sector lost 3.1 percent.

Shares of airlines, which are heavy fuel users, rose as oil plunged. Southwest Airlines gained 75 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $41.48. The stock has gained about 120 percent this year. United Continental jumped $1.17, or 1.9 percent, to $63.69.

Yum Brands, which owns the Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut chains, was one of the day’s biggest losers, dropping $4.69, or 6.2 percent, to $70.53. The stock slumped after the company cut its profit outlook for the year and said that sales in China were recovering more slowly than expected after a food-safety scare.

454,"ALGIERS — With oil prices at their lowest in five years and showing few signs of hitting bottom, Algeria is feeling the pinch.

Though its problems are dwarfed by the impact on Russia, for example, Algeria may have to rein back many of the policies it has held dear over many years. Generous subsidies, for one, may have to be scaled back despite the potential risk of social unrest.

Oil revenues make up 97 percent of the country’s hard currency earnings and 60 percent of the government’s budget. Like Russia, which has seen a full-scale run on its currency, Algeria has made little effort to diversify the economy away from oil and gas. The governor of the central bank, Mohammed Laksaci, has warned that the oil and gas dividend will not last forever, though nearly $200 billion of foreign reserves can help cushion the blow in the short term.

“This capacity to resist such shocks will disappear quickly if the price of oil stays at a low level for a long time,” Mr. Laksaci said recently, deploring the economy’s dependence on oil.

In many ways, the administration of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has echoes with that of his counterpart in Russia, Vladimir V. Putin. Both have seen their long tenures buttressed by oil-driven economic growth.

There has been little impetus for change at the highest levels, with much of the work of the government stalled because of Mr. Bouteflika’s fragile health. Since suffering a stroke in 2013, he has rarely appeared in public.

“This is the system that he built, as long as he is in power he’s going to keep it that way,” said Geoff Porter, a North Africa analyst. “The risks that come with market reform and privatization are too daunting for Algeria right now.”

According to the International Monetary Fund’s latest report on Algeria, growth for 2014 is estimated to be a decent 4 percent. However, it cautioned that with declining oil production and lower prices, Algeria’s imports will exceed its exports this year for the first time in 15 years.

Subsidies, which amount to 21 percent of the country’s annual economic output, cover electricity and many foodstuffs, and the country’s gasoline is the cheapest in North Africa. Some 60 percent of the jobs in the country are on the government payroll and nearly everything is imported.

The government also subsidizes education and provides housing. Social unrest was effectively bought off with higher wages and promises of housing — all funded by the bountiful oil receipts.

Now, however, falling prices have thrown this model into question.

“Algerians will not find anything to eat if the price of oil continues to fall,” warned Habib Zegad, an independent lawmaker, during the debate over the latest central bank figures.

Algeria is still flush and can continue spending at its current rate for the next few years. But Mohammed Sghir Babes, an economist, said the country needed to make changes now to rein in spending and cut subsidies.

But social peace depends on continued spending. On Tuesday, hundreds of young people demonstrated in the desert oil city of Hassi Messaoud, calling for jobs and housing, and in October there were demonstrations by the police for higher salaries.","Algeria, Dependent on Oil, Feels Pinch as Prices Decline",2014-12-21,"Like Russia, which has seen a full-scale run on its currency, Algeria has made little effort to diversify the economy away from oil and gas.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/world/africa/algeria-dependent-on-oil-feels-pinch-as-prices-decline.html

Companies whose fortunes tend to follow global economic growth fared the worst, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 sectors for oil companies and material producers each dropped 2 percent. Those industries that depend on the American economy, including telecommunications, held steady.

The news was mostly downbeat. Business confidence in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, declined for a sixth consecutive month, and Goldman Sachs said slowing economic growth around the world led it to lower its forecast for crude prices.

Last week, the stock market turned in its best performance since January 2013; the S.&P. 500 rose 4.1 percent after four previous weeks of losses. The benchmark index had dropped almost 6 percent by mid-October, but it is now down just a fraction — 0.5 percent — for the month. It is up 6.13 percent so far in 2014.

David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, says he believes the stock market’s volatility is tied to actions by the world’s central banks. The Federal Reserve is expected to wind down its $4 trillion bond-buying program — known as quantitative easing, or Q.E. — this month. And many investors expect the European Central Bank to begin its own program on a similar scale.

“We’re approaching the end of Q.E., and I think the market is going through a period when people are asking, How important is it to lack that support?” Mr. Joy said. “The open question is how robust is the economy you’re left with. Is it strong enough to sustain earnings growth?”

Rising supplies and weak global demand continued to weigh on the price of crude oil on Monday, which has tumbled from a high of $107 a barrel in June. Goldman Sachs was the latest Wall Street bank to lower its forecast for prices in a report, saying OPEC was unlikely to cut exports to try to push prices back up. Crude oil for December delivery fell 1 cent, to settle at $81 a barrel in New York after trading below $80 earlier in the day.

Oil and gas services companies sank. Halliburton and Nabors Industries both dropped more than 6 percent, giving them the biggest losses in the S.&P. 500. Halliburton dropped $3.39, to $52.39, while Nabors fell $1.25, to $17.48.

Among the stocks on the move, shares in the chip maker Micron Technology surged 4 percent, making it the largest gainer in the S.&P. 500, after the company announced plans to spend as much as $1 billion to buy its own shares. Micron jumped $1.24, to $32.30, extending a rally that has pushed its stock up 48 percent this year.

468,"OIL PRICES TUMBLE | Oil prices are in free fall. On Friday, crude oil continued to plummet after the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday not to cut petroleum production reinforced the possibility of a worldwide oil supply glut, Clifford Krauss writes in The New York Times. The benchmark American price for crude oil fell to $66.15, its lowest price in more than four years. The Brent price has fallen more than a third since June and closed on Friday at $70.15 a barrel. “The inability or unwillingness of OPEC to act showed that the cartel was no longer the dominating producer whose decisions determine global supplies and prices,” Mr. Krauss writes. The balance of power is now shifting to the United States, which is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia as the world’s top producer. Oil prices have come under pressure as global output of crude oil exceeded demand this year. In particular, domestic oil production has soared more 70 percent over the last six years, to roughly nine million barrels a day. The country is still a net importer, but with production growing by more than a million barrels a day every year, it is importing less and less almost every month. Imports from OPEC producers have been cut by more than a half in recent years, forcing increasing competition among Saudi Arabia and other exporting countries seeking to replace the American market with Chinese and other Asian markets. The tumbling price in oil has produced economic hardship and potential political problems for OPEC producers like Venezuela and Iran. How low can oil prices go? Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust, told Reuters, “Crude seems to have no floor right now, and we could easily see the price drop into the low $60s.” Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup, told The Wall Street Journal, “There’s lower prices ahead.” On Monday morning, benchmark futures in New York and London slumped as much as 3.7 percent, before making up some of those losses. “It’s clear that a production war is on and it will be survival of the fittest,” Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago, said in an email to Bloomberg News.



NEW TROUBLE FOR MORTGAGE BANKS | A lawsuit is putting United States-backed mortgages to the test, DealBook’s Peter Eavis reports. U.S. Bank, a division of U.S. Bancorp, is facing a lawsuit for not engaging with borrowers who have missed payment, which could mean fresh legal problems for other big mortgage banks. The legal action is the latest threat to emerge from a barrage of cases that have forced big banks to pay tens of billions of dollars in recent months. The lawsuit focuses on a popular type of government-guaranteed mortgage that requires that banks take distinct steps when borrowers stop paying. The lawsuit is being brought by Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, a legal aid group. The group is suing U.S. Bank in federal court in Ohio on behalf of the United States government, using the False Claims Act, which allows private citizens and groups to pursue legal action against companies and other entities for receiving payments from the government on false grounds. The group is focusing on mortgages that were guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, which is part of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Justice Department recently declined to join the legal action. In the last two years, big banks have agreed to penalties of over $40 billion to settle government accusations that they packaged shoddy mortgages and sold them to investors. In its complaint, Advocates for Basic Legal Equality contends that U.S. Bank made 22,586 claims to the F.H.A. from 2001 to 2011 and received at least $2.37 billion in payments for the claims. When asked whether Advocates for Basic Legal Equality could convincingly argue that a significant proportion of those claims did not meet F.H.A. requirements for dealing with borrowers, a lawyer for the organization said, “I’ve been representing homeowners in foreclosure for seven years and I’ve never seen a case when U.S. Bank complied with these regulations.”

HEDGE FUND TITAN IN HUGE DIVORCE SETTLEMENT | A London high court judge has ordered Chris Hohn, founder of one of Britain’s biggest and most successful hedge funds, to pay his former wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn, $531 million to settle their divorce, Jenny Anderson writes in DealBook. The figure, which represents one of the biggest divorce awards known in Britain, demonstrates the wealth Mr. Hohn has accumulated at the helm of the Children’s Investment Fund, known as TCI, the approximately $12 billion hedge fund he founded in 2004. Much of that wealth has gone into the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, created by the couple, which now has $4.6 billion and is one of Britain’s biggest charities. Ms. Cooper-Hohn’s lawyer argued during the trial that she was entitled to 50 percent of their assets, estimated at one point to be $1.3 billion. It is not yet clear what proportion she received. On Thursday, the two appeared in court to hash out a number of contentious issues, including whether he paid her rent on time and the fallout from bribery accusations Mr. Hohn made against her related to the foundation, Ms. Cooper-Hohn’s lawyers said in court. Both Mr. Hohn and Ms. Cooper-Hohn are trustees of the foundation. The divorce proceedings have complicated the operations of the foundation, said one person briefed on the situation. As part of the negotiations, Ms. Cooper-Hohn offered to lower her settlement amount in exchange for Mr. Hohn’s supporting a proposal for a division of the foundation, whose operations had been adversely affected by their inability to work together, according to the person briefed on the situation. He asserted to the trustees that it was a bribe and that her lawyers knew about it. The trustees hired a pair of expensive and prominent lawyers to investigate. They found no substance to the bribery claim, the person said. The couple separated in December 2012 and divorced in 2013. They have four children, including triplets.

470,"The advertisements, with a backdrop of sun-dappled beaches and comforting music, dispute claims that the project would harm the environment and note that the method of drilling would mean no unsightly oil platforms on the horizon. The wells would drop straight into the ground before turning toward the oil under the ocean.

Officials said the project was being jeopardized by unfounded fears in a state that has long been protective of the environment and wary of oil companies.

“It’s the California coastline, and that’s always a challenge,” Michael Finch, a vice president with E&B, said. “We suffer from the ‘I don’t want it in my backyard’ syndrome. But you are talking about a 1.3-acre site that would be behind a 35-foot wall.”

He said it would be more environmentally sound to drill for the oil here and put it right into the California distribution system than to ship it from across the globe.

The campaign has set off fraught neighbor-versus-neighbor debates about the future of this peaceful community, while fueling pointed questions about how the city ended up in such a financially vulnerable position. (City officials noted that the energy company had originally pushed for a much higher penalty for breaking the contract.)

An environmental-impact statement commissioned by Hermosa Beach listed nine potential areas of concern that it said the company would be unable to mitigate, including air quality, aesthetics and noise.

“Hermosa Beach is a real small beach town,” said Hany Fangary, an environmental lawyer who is a member of the City Council. “We like the feeling of a beach town. If you have someone coming in and putting 34 oil wells right near the beach, it changes the character of the city.”

Supporters of the project say the fears voiced by opponents — declining property values, offensive odors and the potential for a spill that could spray fuel into the water, on the beach or over neighboring houses — are exaggerated.

“I’m very much in favor of it,” said Jim Sullivan, a commercial real estate broker. “It’s the best thing to come down the road for Hermosa Beach in its entire history.”

Concern is driven in no small part by the conspicuous location for the proposed wells: a maintenance yard, now used to store city vehicles, that is in the middle of the city and surrounded by homes and businesses. For months at a time, drill rigs would soar as much as 110 feet, and construction is supposed to take at least three years.

This is hardly a community of beachfront mansions. The streets are lined with small (but not inexpensive) homes where people, though able to feel the sweep of Pacific Ocean breezes, do not exactly have privacy: The entire community fills just 1.4 square miles.

“We are all kind of crammed in here,” said George Schmeltzer, 76, a former mayor who has lived here for 53 years and is a leader of the opposition. “You can hear your neighbor brush his teeth. We are off-kilter in a pleasant kind of way.”

“It’s not an atomic bomb,” he said of the project. “But doggone it, it doesn’t seem right for a residential neighborhood.”

The company anticipates that the drilling would produce 35 million barrels over the 34-year life of the project, producing a potential $500 million windfall for Hermosa. (The revenue projection was made when the price of oil was close to $100 a barrel; it is about half that now.)

But the more pressing question may be whether to pay $17.5 million to terminate the drilling contract. The initial ban on drilling was passed in 1932, about 13 years after California awarded Hermosa Beach the tidelands with the oil fields. In 1984, with the promise of much-needed revenue for the city, voters approved initiatives granting two exemptions to permit oil drilling. In 1986, the City Council approved the first version of a contract that would be repeatedly amended over the next six years, awarding drilling rights to a company that was a predecessor to E&B.

In 1995, voters reinstated the ban on oil drilling, leading the company to sue for damages. After years of litigation, the city in 2012 said it would let drilling begin only if approved by a ballot measure, and agreed to pay E&B the penalty if the initiative was defeated.

The city has a surplus of close to $7 million that it has put aside to help pay the penalty. The rest would be paid in roughly $800,000 annual installments.

“An $800,000-a-year payment to preserve the quality of life and the special beach community that we have certainly seems worth it,” said Stacey Armato, one of the leaders of the anti-drilling effort.",California Beach Community to Decide if It’s ‘an Oil Town’,2015-03-03,Hermosa Beach will go to the polls on Tuesday to decide whether to follow through on a longstanding contract for drilling rights or pay millions to kill the deal.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/hermosa-beach-california-oil-drilling-vote.html

At the start of the week, slumping oil prices and the state of the world economy were investors’ main worries. A plunge in the Russian currency, the ruble, added to a sense of unease.

The turnaround came on Wednesday, when Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said that she saw no reason to raise interest rates in early 2015, and that the central bank would be “patient” in deciding when to raise rates from near zero.

Her comments eased concerns that the Fed would start raising rates while growth in other major economies is looking weak. Traders celebrated, driving the S.&P. 500 up 4.5 percent over two days.

472,"“There is country-specific risk for Russia that’s not going to go away,” said ​Phyllis Papadavid, a foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in London. “But there’s a larger story.”

In Russia, investors are growing increasingly worried that the Kremlin has in effect decided to print money to address a growing debt problem. Traders are also raising concern that the cronyism and opaque insider dealings that have plagued business here have now spread to monetary policy.

According to analysts, the ruble’s fall on Monday was sparked by word of an opaque deal involving the central bank and the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft. The well-connected business executive running the company, Igor I. Sechin, a longtime associate of Mr. Putin, had apparently persuaded the central bank to effectively issue billions of new rubles to his company to help cover debts.

The governor of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, speaking on Russian television, said the interest rate decision had been made to stanch the fall of the ruble. In its moves, the Russian central bank also increased allotments of dollars to the Russian banking system to finance the purchase of rubles as part of the effort to stabilize the currency.

“We have to learn to live in a different zone, to orient ourselves more toward our own sources of financing,” she said. In her televised remarks, Ms. Nabiullina said Russia would not resort to capital controls to stem the ruble’s fall.

But traders have long fretted that Ms. Nabiullina, a former economy minister, lacked the political spine to stand up to Mr. Putin or his longtime allies like Mr. Sechin. And yet, though the absence of any credible independence by the central bank is at the heart of the ruble crisis today, it is unclear any figure in Russia could provide it given the ever more authoritarian nature of Mr. Putin’s rule.

Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, wrote on Twitter that “the fall of the ruble and the stock market is not just a reaction to the low price of oil and to sanctions, but also due to a lack of confidence in the government’s economic policy.”

In the oil boom years, the government of Mr. Putin assumed an ever-larger role in the economy. Longtime associates of Mr. Putin’s from his hometown, St. Petersburg, or from his years in the Soviet KGB intelligence agency took the helms of huge new state-owned enterprises. All the while, the central bank and a liberal wing of economic policy advisers kept aloof from this politically driven divvying up of assets.

Now, market sentiment is shifting. A continued fall in the value of the ruble could present Mr. Putin with difficult choices and could make it more difficult to sustain the political support he has enjoyed at home even as his relations with the West have frayed.

He faces a particularly delicate dance with Russian companies, which are under significant financing strains. Russian corporations and banks are scheduled to repay $30 billion in foreign loans this month.

And next year, about $130 billion will be due. There is no obvious source for these hard currency payments other than the central bank, whose credibility is now being called into question.

Rosneft, for example, had been clamoring for months for a government bailout to refinance debt the company ran up while making acquisitions when oil prices were high. Because of sanctions, those loans cannot be rolled over with Western banks. Debt payments are coming due later this month.

Relying only on the company’s own cash reserves would disrupt oil development projects that Russia is relying on for future revenue. With the oil giant in a bind, the central bank ruled that it would accept Rosneft bonds held by commercial banks as collateral for loans.

Rosneft issued 625 billion rubles about $10.9 billion at the exchange rate at the time, in new bonds on Friday. The identities of the buyers were not publicly disclosed, but analysts say that large state banks bought the issue.

When these banks deposit the bonds with the central bank in exchange for loans, Rosneft will have been financed, in effect, with an emission of rubles from the central bank. The deal roiled the ruble on Monday, according to analysts.

The reason for Monday’s currency crash is “well known,” Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister who is now in the political opposition, wrote on his Facebook page. “The central bank started the printing press to help the Sechin-Putin business, and gave Rosneft 625 billion newly printed rubles. The money immediately appeared on the currency market, and the rate collapsed.” Rosneft, in a statement, denied it had exchanged funds raised from the bonds for hard currency.

“This is a result of aggression and insanity in foreign policy, which led to sanctions,” Mr. Nemtsov wrote of the ruble’s collapse.",Russia’s Steep Rate Increase Fails to Stem Ruble’s Decline,2014-12-17,"Despite the Russian central bank’s extraordinary effort to defend the ruble, the currency fell to record lows, inducing further panic in the nation’s financial industry.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/business/russia-ruble-interest-rates.html
473,"Even though BP announced higher quarterly profits on Tuesday, its stock was hammered by the sanctions news, falling 3 percent. BP warned investors bluntly that further sanctions “could adversely impact our business and strategic objectives in Russia.”

Dan Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the new energy measures underscored how much ties had deteriorated. “A year ago, Western collaboration with Russia’s energy sector was one of the bright spots in what had become a dour relationship,” he said. “No longer.”

The carefully orchestrated actions on both sides of the Atlantic were intended to demonstrate solidarity in the face of what American and European officials say has been a stark escalation by Russia in the insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Until now, European leaders had resisted the broader sorts of actions they agreed to on Tuesday, and their decision to pursue them reflected increasing alarm that Russia was not only helping separatists in Ukraine but directly involving itself in the fighting.

They are “meant as a strong warning,” Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said in a statement on Tuesday that was joined by José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission. “Destabilizing Ukraine, or any other Eastern European neighboring state, will bring heavy costs,” the statement said.

President Obama said Russia’s economy would continue to suffer until it reversed course. “Today is a reminder that the United States means what it says, and we will rally the international community in standing up for the rights and freedom of people around the world,” he told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.

Mr. Obama said the fact that Europe was now joining the United States in broader measures meant the moves would “have an even bigger bite,” but in response to reporters’ questions, he said it was “not a new Cold War” between the two countries. He also made clear he was not considering providing arms to Ukraine’s government, as some Republicans have suggested, as it tries to put down the pro-Russian insurgency.

“They are better armed than the separatists,” he said. “The issue is, ‘How do we prevent bloodshed in eastern Ukraine?’ We’re trying to avoid that. And the main tool that we have to influence Russian behavior at this point is the impact that it’s having on its economy.”

The American and European actions were intended to largely, though not precisely, match each other. The United States cut off three more Russian banks, including the giant VTB Bank, from medium- and long-term capital markets and barred Americans from doing business with the United Shipbuilding Corporation, a large state-owned firm created by Mr. Putin. The Obama administration also formally suspended export credit and development finance to Russia.

The European Union adopted similar restrictions on capital markets and applied them to Russian state-owned banks. It imposed an embargo on new arms sales to Russia and limited sales of equipment with both civilian and military uses to Russian military buyers. Europe also approved new sanctions against at least three close Putin associates, but did not identify them publicly.

European governments moved ahead despite concerns that Europe would pay an economic price for confronting the Kremlin more aggressively. While their actions went far beyond any previously taken against Russia over the Ukraine crisis, they were tailored to minimize their own costs. The arms embargo, for instance, applies only to future sales, not to the much-debated delivery by France of Mistral-class helicopter carriers that resemble bigger aircraft carriers. And the energy technology restrictions do not apply to Russian natural gas, on which Europe relies heavily.

The new sanctions could take effect as soon as Friday, though the necessary legal formalities would most likely to take longer to complete, officials said.

On Twitter, the president of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaite, praised the decision “on a wide range of sanctions on Russia.” But she expressed unease that France would be able to maintain its naval deal with Moscow. “Unfortunately, nothing to stop the deal of Mistral yet,” she wrote. Lithuania is one of five European Union states that are close to or border Russia.

Mr. Van Rompuy departed from the usual cautious language of Europe’s declarations by condemning Russia for actions that “cannot be accepted in 21st-century Europe,” including “illegal annexation of territory” — a reference to Crimea — “and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country.” He also cited the “anger and frustration” over the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over rebel-held territory on July 17 and “the delays in providing international access to the site of the air crash, the tampering with the remains of the plane, and the disrespectful handling of the deceased.”

Although European commerce with Russia will probably decline because of the sanctions, where the measures are expected to more severely affect Russia are the restrictions on the ability of Russian banks to raise money in Europe and the United States. “These sanctions can have quite a substantial chilling effect on the Russian economy,” said Adam Slater, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in London. “That is probably a quite effective way to put pressure on Russia.”

Still, it could take time for the effects to be felt by ordinary Russians, and some analysts expected the Kremlin to shrug them off, at least publicly.",Coordinated Sanctions Aim at Russia’s Ability to Tap Its Oil Reserves,2014-07-30,"The United States and Europe began a joint effort to curb Russia’s long-term ability to develop new oil resources, taking aim at a source of Kremlin power in retaliation for its intervention in Ukraine.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/europe/european-sanctions-russia.html

492,"AS a young reporter covering energy for The New York Times, I saw firsthand the distortions and inefficiencies caused by the web of regulations that followed the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, and the resulting surge in gasoline prices.

So I shared in the frisson of excitement last month when the Commerce Department cleared two Texas companies to export an ultralight, processed form of oil called condensate. It seemed like a step toward relaxing the ban on the export of crude oil, the biggest stricture remaining from the ’70s energy crisis.

But then the Obama administration quickly insisted that the Commerce Department, in narrowing the definition of crude oil so that condensate could be exported, was not about to lift the ban more widely. “There has been no change to our policy on crude oil exports,” a White House spokesman said.

That’s unfortunate, because America’s renewed hydrocarbon boom could be even more robust if we eased outdated restrictions on shipping both crude oil and liquefied natural gas overseas.

It’s true that the United States still imports about six million barrels of oil a day — about one-third of our needs.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But not all oil is created equal, and the lightweight type that we are producing in growing quantities in North Dakota, Texas and elsewhere is not compatible with many of our refineries, which were built to process the heavier crude oil that we typically import.

A result is a supply and pricing mishmash that causes domestic oil to sell for as much as $10 per barrel below the global market price, currently $107.

That, sadly, doesn’t help consumers. Because gasoline (and other refined oil products) can legally be exported, the pump price in America reflects the higher world price. The result: undeserved excess profits for refiners, as demonstrated by the sharp drop in their stock prices when the Commerce Department made its technical change.

If the export ban were lifted completely, the price of crude oil in the United States would rise to the global price (adjusted for transportation costs and differences in quality), but the price of gasoline at the pump wouldn’t change.

Yes, the higher price of crude oil would mean more profits for producers; more important, it would encourage drilling. That means more production, more jobs, and less reliance on imports and an improvement in our trade balance.

Natural gas also needs to be freed from burdensome rules. The surge in supply that has resulted from industry advancements in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling has artificially depressed prices in the United States.

By exporting liquefied natural gas, we would earn valuable export dollars. Prices would most likely go up, but not by much — 10 percent, according to an estimate by the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University — because the high cost of liquefying and transporting natural gas would keep a ceiling on the price that producers could obtain.

But we’ve been slow. Only one project, Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana, has received all the necessary permits. While the Obama administration made a recent procedural change intended to accelerate the process somewhat, it has stopped short of a full-throated endorsement. President Obama recently told reporters that Europe was too dependent on gas exports from Russia and that greater natural gas exports would benefit the United States, but that “it’s not something that can happen overnight.”

That’s partly because of opposition from environmentalists, who are determined to curtail the use of fracking. While regulation should be tough, we needn’t ban these unconventional means of energy production. After all, greater use of natural gas and oil by other countries means less burning of more damaging fuels, particularly coal.

For a change, the Republican-controlled House has produced a productive piece of legislation, a bill (supported by 46 Democrats) that would require faster action by the Department of Energy in permitting natural gas exports. The Senate should take it up.

Experts from the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations support lifting the ban on crude oil exports. Politicians need not fret. Nothing would prevent the United States from shutting off exports during national emergencies. Nor, in the event of another huge spike in world prices, would Congress be prevented from imposing taxes on crude oil at the wellhead to prevent windfall profits.

Energy policy should not be driven by emotion. Paradoxically, the fastest way to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy is to speed the export of crude oil and natural gas.",Let Our Oil and Gas Go,2014-07-24,Take advantage of our energy boom.

493,"American economic growth is accelerating, and the market is deeply oversold, the bulls say. Growth is slowing in China and virtually nonexistent in Europe, the bears counter, and Saudi Arabia’s decision not to come to the market’s rescue bodes ill for a swift rebound.

“There are people on both sides of the argument, but at least in the near term the path of least resistance is probably lower,” said Richard Steinberg, a partner in New York for HighTower, a nationwide firm of financial advisers.

Morris Mark, founder and managing partner of Mark Asset Management, is bearish enough to have eliminated all of the 12 percent exposure he had to energy at the start of 2014. Increased production is overwhelming the global oil market, in his view, and he expects prices to stay depressed until balance is restored, something he does not anticipate soon.

A sustained oil-price decline is unlikely “to be reversed until a broader-based environment of worldwide economic growth results in enough new demand to absorb that growing capacity,” Mr. Mark said in a note to shareholders. “Even in today’s uncertain geopolitical environment, production in Libya is going up, production in Iraq is being maintained and production in the Western Hemisphere is increasing.”

It is for now, but many companies don’t have the luxury of waiting for the world to recover. Some analysts speculate that Saudi Arabia’s decision not to cut production was meant to push North American rivals to rein in theirs. If that was the plan, it seems to be working. Two large domestic producers, ConocoPhillips and Apache, have announced cuts in 2015 spending plans, as have some smaller operators. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consulting firm, estimates that global spending to drill new wells will fall to $365 billion this year from $400 billion if oil averages $70 a barrel, or to $350 billion with $60 oil, with greater declines in later years.

Lower output means that bear markets hurt the earnings of energy companies in two ways, said Daniel Morris, a global investment strategist at TIAA-CREF, in a recent report. The prices they command for their products fall, and they sell fewer of them.

But investors may still find winners against such a backdrop, especially after the steep plunge in energy stocks. Mr. Morris recommends the shares of domestic refinery operators.

“U.S. refiners have substantial competitive advantages relative to their European counterparts,” he said, “and U.S. stocks in the industry are likely to outperform those of the more expensive exploration and production companies.”

Mr. Steinberg cautioned that investing in refiners amounted to making a geopolitical forecast, always a tricky proposition. Refiners make money from the gap between what they pay for crude oil and what they get from selling refined products like gasoline.

Brent crude, the main European grade, has been trading at a high premium over domestic crude, partly because of tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, he noted. That lets American refiners benefit from lower input costs and high global prices for refined goods, a perfect combination that may not last.

Mr. Steinberg said that almost any energy investment would perform well if oil bounced back to $100 a barrel, but that he preferred the safer end of the spectrum, especially operators of storage centers and pipelines.

“If you own a pipeline, you don’t care if oil is $50 or $100, as long as it’s moving from Point A to Point B,” he said. “That’s the part of the food chain that I want to be in.” Investors have been selling shares of these safe businesses despite the tenuous connection to energy prices — leaving them cheap, in his view.

Although he prefers to invest company by company, Mr. Steinberg acknowledged that not everyone could survey the investment landscape with the same circumspection. He considers E.T.F.s useful alternatives.

“For somebody who doesn’t have the time or ability to do individual-company analysis, then, absolutely, E.T.F.s are the right way to go,” he said.

Mr. Rosenbluth agreed that infrastructure companies were “safer for a variety of reasons,” including the large dividends they pay, but he recommended avoiding them. The oil-price plunge has created a buying opportunity that he advised longer-term investors to exploit through E.T.F.s in industries that stand to capture it more fully. An example is Market Vectors Oil Services, which invests in providers of oil field services and equipment.

Those companies have “taken it on the chin,” he said, “but we think they’re undervalued.” The Market Vectors E.T.F. was down 25.3 percent for the full year and 38.1 percent from its high in early July.

John Gabriel, an analyst at Morningstar who covers energy E.T.F.s, likes the Market Vectors fund for similar reasons. It trades about 21 percent below where it should, he said, based on the fair values that Morningstar analysts calculate for the portfolio’s stocks, and he prefers vehicles that provide comparatively undiluted exposure to a rally in oil.

“This is probably where you’re going to get the most bang for your buck,” Mr. Gabriel said. “If you’re trying to bottom-fish and ride the rebound,” he added, such a fund “is going to give you the most leverage.”

For investors interested in broader exposure, Mr. Rosenbluth suggested the Energy Select Sector SPDR. He said its portfolio was concentrated in large companies, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Schlumberger, that offer consistency and strength, traits that could come in handy while the sector finds its footing.

“Oil will stabilize and move higher at some point,” he predicted, “but the recovery will be choppy, so larger companies will hold up better.”

Mr. Gabriel judges the SPDR E.T.F. to be 17 percent undervalued. He also finds another E.T.F., iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production, to be a bargain, at 20 percent below fair value. So-called E.&P. exchange-traded funds offer concentrated exposure to a rebound, as the service funds do, he said. They also offer concentrated risk if prices keep falling, but with the funds apparently cheap, even factoring in reduced earnings prospects, he views them as a risk worth taking.

“Energy is the most attractive sector based on valuations,” he said. “It’s not for the faint of heart, but for someone who wants to invest for the long term, this might be a good opportunity.”","Trying to Capitalize on Lower Oil Prices, Through E.T.F.s",2015-01-11,"Oil&#8217;s price plunge hurt energy funds, but investors may still be able to make good bets by focusing on specific pieces of the industry.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/business/mutfund/trying-to-capitalize-on-lower-oil-prices-through-etfs.html

500,"“Like any sort of black market smuggling operation, if you devote the resources and the effort to attack it, you are unlikely to eradicate it, but you are likely to put a very significant dent in it,” a senior administration official said on Saturday.

A second senior official said that Mr. Obama’s national security team had spoken several times with Mr. Erdogan and other top Turkish officials in the past two weeks about what they can do to help counter ISIS, and that ISIS’ financing was part of those discussions. “Stopping the flow of foreign fighters, border security and dismantling ISIL funding networks are also key aspects of our strategy, and we will continue to work closely with Turkey and our other partners in the region on these efforts in the days ahead,” the official said, using a different acronym to describe the militant organization.

At the core of the talks are the dozen or so oil fields and refineries in Iraq and Syria on territory the group has controlled. The output has provided a steady stream of financing, which experts place at $1 million to $2 million a day — a pittance in terms of the global oil market, but a huge windfall for a terror group.

“Oil is a huge part of the financing equation” that empowers ISIS, said James Phillips, the senior fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based research center.

The territory ISIS controls in Iraq alone is currently producing anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil a day, which can fetch a minimum of $1.2 million on the black market, according to Luay al-Khatteeb, a visiting foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, who also directs the Iraq Energy Institute. Some estimates have placed the daily income ISIS derives from oil sales at $2 million, though American officials are skeptical it is that high.

“The key gateway through that black market is the southern corridor of Turkey,” Mr. Khatteeb said. “Turkey is becoming part of this black economy” that funds ISIS.

But targeting the smuggling network has proved a major challenge, and so far the Turkish authorities have been unwilling to cooperate.

“They’ve been turning a blind eye to it, because they benefit from the lower price of smuggled black-market oil,” Mr. Phillips said, “and I’m sure there are substantial numbers of Turks that are also profiting from this, maybe even government officials.”.

The supply chain of routes, individuals, families and organizations that allow the oil to flow are well-established, some dating back decades, to when President Saddam Hussein of Iraq smuggled oil during the United Nations’ oil-for-food program. “Those borders have never been sealed, and they never will be sealed,” Mr. Phillips said.

For the Obama administration, getting at ISIS’ oil revenue is far more complex than, say, its crackdown on Iran. That has been the administration’s most successful use of sanctions, and officials credit the effects on Iran’s economy, along with American sabotage of its nuclear facilities, for Iran’s reluctant decision to negotiate on the future of its nuclear enrichment program.

But Iran used fairly conventional means of reaching oil markets, and not one of its techniques applies to ISIS’ black-market sales, which take place mostly through networks of smugglers.

The long-term American plan appears focused on persuading Turkey to crack down on the smuggling networks — some of which, one Western diplomat noted, “benefit a powerful Turkish elite” — and aiming at the refiners who would ultimately have to turn the crude oil into petrochemical products. But gathering the intelligence is a slow process, analysts say.

“It’s hard to use any of the suite of tools that are available to the U.S. Treasury Department to sanction people in this case,” said Patrick B. Johnston, a RAND Corporation researcher who is working on a top-to-bottom study of ISIS’ financing and organization. “Getting a grip on who the right financial targets would be at the Treasury Department would be difficult.”

That is equally true of the other major source of ISIS money — its extortion activities in the areas it controls, said Mr. Johnston, who is examining declassified documents that detail the group’s funding streams. ISIS demands anywhere from 10 percent to 20 percent of revenue from businesses in its territories and operates other “mafia-style” rackets that yield as much as $1 million a day.","Struggling to Starve ISIS of Oil Revenue, U.S. Seeks Assistance From Turkey",2014-09-14,"The territory ISIS controls in Iraq produces thousands of barrels of oil that can fetch millions on the Turkish black market, and U.S. officials are leaning heavily on Turkey to take action.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/world/middleeast/struggling-to-starve-isis-of-oil-revenue-us-seeks-assistance-from-turkey.html

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — The 115-year-old Kern River oil field unfolds into the horizon, thousands of bobbing pumpjacks seemingly occupying every corner of a desert landscape here in California’s Central Valley. A contributor to the state’s original oil boom, it is still going strong as the nation’s fifth-largest oil field, yielding 70,000 barrels a day.

But the Kern River field also produces 10 times more of something that, at least during California’s continuing drought, has become more valuable to many locals and has experienced the kind of price spike more familiar to oil: water. The field’s owner, Chevron, sells millions of gallons every day to a local water district that distributes it to farmers growing almonds, pistachios, citrus fruits and other crops.

It is one of the more unusual sources of water, one whose importance has increased in a year when the drought has forced farmers to fallow fields and bulldoze almond orchards. The water is pumped out of the same underground rock that contains oil; after the two are separated, the water flows through an eight-mile pipeline to Bakersfield’s Cawelo Water District, which this year will rely on Chevron’s water for half of its supply, up from an average of a quarter. The district sells it exclusively to farmers for irrigation and reduces its salinity by blending it with water from other sources.

“These are the years that it really shines, because that water is constant no matter what the hydrology is,” said David R. Ansolabehere, the district’s general manager. “In wet years, it almost becomes a problem because we don’t have so much use for it. But in dry years, boy, it really does come in handy.”

Criticized for its use of water, especially in the process known as fracking, the oil industry is focusing on efforts to conserve and recycle water — or, in this case, to increase the available supply for irrigation. As drought has gripped California and Texas, the nation’s No. 3 and No. 1 oil-producing states, respectively, the industry has taken tentative steps to minimize its freshwater consumption. Some companies are recycling water produced in fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, while others have been fracking with brackish water and even without water.

Critics dismiss the water conservation measures as political ploys. They point out that Chevron and the Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group, are among the biggest lobbyists in Sacramento, and that they recently helped defeat a bill that would have declared a statewide moratorium on fracking.

What is more, critics say, California must rely on industry figures for the amount and kind of water used in oil production.

The price of American benchmark oil surged 7 percent, and Brent crude was up 6 percent, on hopes that a seven-month collapse in prices that had rattled financial markets was ending. All 10 industry sectors of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose, led by a 2.8 percent gain in energy shares.

Stocks climbed from the start after a rally in European markets on signs that Greece’s new government won’t press for a write-off of the country’s bailout loans. The benchmark stock index in Athens jumped 11 percent.

American investors were also encouraged by a surge in auto sales last month.

When the Obama administration announced on Monday that it would let Shell drill for oil off the Alaskan coast this year if it met certain conditions, environmentalists were outraged — not just by the administration’s decision to allow drilling, but by its decision to give Shell, in particular, the green light.

They said that the company’s track record in the Arctic should rule out another chance for it. Shell tried to drill in the Arctic in 2012, and the company’s multibillion-dollar drilling rig, the Kulluk, ran aground. The operator of a drill ship hired by Shell also pleaded guilty to eight felony offenses and agreed to pay $12.2 million over shoddy record-keeping that covered up hazardous conditions and jury-rigged equipment that discharged polluted water.

“Shell has already proven itself not up to the challenge of development in the Arctic Ocean,” said Franz Matzner, the director of the Beyond Oil Initiative at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “But it’s not just Shell. The fact is, there’s no safe way to pursue oil exploration in the frozen wastes of the Arctic Ocean.”

He added, “This is an inexplicable decision to do something that is dirty, dangerous and unnecessary.”

Shell, Europe’s leading oil company, has spent about $7 billion in the Alaskan Arctic over the last decade, and drilled two shallow wells during the 2012 attempt.

But the federal government did not allow the company to reach the deeper oil-bearing formations because the containment dome designed to cap a runaway well had been destroyed in testing.

Shell executives said they had shaken up their Alaska team, putting in new management that would emphasize better management of contractors, readiness for any problems and contingency plans to care for any accidents.

“The program has been fortified by new assets, an increased number of vessels, but most notably a new drilling rig,” said Curtis Smith, a company spokesman, adding that Shell had revamped its management of contractors.

“It’s our view we put together the most environmentally sensitive, technically sound Arctic program ever assembled,” he said, “and if we didn’t have confidence in it, we wouldn’t execute it, even if we had all the permits.”

At a news conference in Houston last month, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell expressed confidence in the company’s new plan, saying, “There is no question Shell learned expensive, painful lessons about contractors and safety.” She also said that Shell had improved its containment plans in case of a spill.

Such statements hardly satisfy environmentalists, however. Even some competing oil company executives openly wonder why Shell is trying again.

“It’s too complicated,” Claudio Descalzi, the chief executive of the Italian oil company Eni, said in a recent interview. The company allowed its lease in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea to expire without drilling. “Everything that is too complicated is too expensive and too risky — and my job is to reduce risk,” he said.

Patrick Pouyanné, the chief executive of Total, a French oil giant that produces natural gas in the Russian Arctic, also expressed doubts about drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic with prices virtually cut in half in recent months.

“At $50 a barrel, it does not make any sense,” he said in an interview. “These are high-cost resources.” He added that a spill “could be very detrimental for the reputation of a company.”

After Shell’s problems, ConocoPhillips and the Norwegian oil giant Statoil suspended their Alaskan Arctic drilling plans.

Climate scientists have said for years that global warming would open stretches of the Arctic Ocean to shipping and drilling. And the Alaskan Arctic is one of the great untapped frontiers for offshore drilling in the United States, with the potential to produce up to a million barrels a day, or more than 10 percent of current domestic production, according to industry estimates.

But many experts warn that Arctic Ocean oil exploration involves high costs and enormous risks. An Arctic oil spill would have none of the conditions that helped mitigate effects of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, including warm water, sunlight, relatively calm weather and ready access to cleanup and rescue equipment.

President Obama’s commission on the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill warned in its comprehensive report against rushing into the offshore Arctic.

While the sea depths and oil reservoir pressure are likely to present fewer challenges to extraction than conditions found in the deepwater wells of the Gulf of Mexico, the authors wrote, the fierce weather conditions and likely long life of any spilled oil — along with the expected difficulty of mopping up spills and the effects on the environment — all mean that getting oil out of the oceans off Alaska “requires the utmost care.”

A research letter published in January in the journal Nature suggested that, under the international voluntary target of keeping a global temperature rise to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) to avert some of the worst outcomes of climate change, “all Arctic resources should be considered as unburnable.”

Christophe McGlade, a research associate at University College London and an author of the paper, said that the costs and risks of Arctic reserves were too high, especially if climate regulations reduced the demand for fossil fuels in general. Oil and gas needs could then be met with more economical methods of recovery, including hydraulic fracturing.

James Leaton, the research director at Carbon Tracker Initiative, a think tank devoted to climate change business issues, questioned Shell’s determination to return to the Arctic.

“We struggle to see how Shell could make a profit for shareholders at the lower oil prices we’re seeing today,” he said. “They are like a dog with a bone,” he added; having spent billions, “they’re unable to let go of it.”

Mr. Smith, the Shell spokesman, said, “We take a long-term view of price and energy supplies.”",Shell&#8217;s Record Adds to the Anger of Those Opposing Arctic Drilling,2015-05-13,Environmentalists cited past problems with a drilling rig&#8217;s running aground in 2012.

HOUSTON — Oil prices rose and gasoline prices remained low and stable on Monday, the opposite of what usually happens when labor strife threatens the operations of refineries.

About 3,800 members of the United Steelworkers union walked off their jobs on Sunday at nine refineries and chemical plants that process roughly 10 percent of the nation’s gasoline, diesel, heating oil and jet fuel.

It was the first time since 1980 that workers staged such a broad strike against the nation’s refineries, but at all but one of the refineries, energy companies were able to keep operations going with nonunion management crews. The one plant that was shut, Tesoro’s refinery in Martinez, Calif., was already partly shut down for seasonal maintenance.

The country is already awash in fuel supplies, giving the refiners and the union time to settle their dispute before there is a meaningful impact on consumer energy prices and the nation’s economy.

Energy experts said both management and unions had ample incentive to settle the dispute. Refiners are making excellent margins these days with cheap crude supplies and robust demand for the more expensive spring blends they will be producing in the next couple of months. At the same time, unions have only slight leverage in plants that are not particularly labor-intensive.

“I have never seen a refinery strike that has actually resulted in the shutdown of a U.S. plant,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. “Management can operate and they have a lot of automated systems.”

The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline nationwide on Monday was $2.06, unchanged from the day before. Global oil benchmark prices rose more than 3 percent on Monday, when the Brent oil price approached $55 a barrel. If a serious refinery stoppage were imminent, gasoline prices would be expected to surge because of the lack of supply, and oil prices would be expected to fall because of the expected drop in demand.

The current national average gasoline price is about $1.22 a gallon less than it was a year ago, according to the AAA auto club. But AAA said it was possible that prices would rise in the coming weeks because of planned maintenance of refineries as they begin the switch from winter fuels to summer fuels.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

The issues involved in the labor dispute include health care, overtime and staffing levels, which union leaders say are too low, leaving workers tired and prone to error. The union also noted what it called “daily occurrences” of fires, emissions, leaks and explosions that threaten local communities without the industry’s taking adequate action.

Talks to reach a new three-year contract began Jan. 21.

A protracted stalemate could lead to a nationwide strike of 30,000 union workers at refineries, chemical plants and pipeline facilities, which could potentially affect nearly two-thirds of the nation’s fuel production. While most energy experts think that is unlikely, union leaders are talking tough.

“The oil companies do not want to work with us to improve the workplace and safety at oil refineries and facilities,” said a union vice president, Thomas M. Conway.

Representatives of the oil companies involved, including Shell Oil, Tesoro, Marathon Petroleum and LyondellBasell Industries, say they are committed to negotiating a resolution of the dispute.",Oil and Gas Prices Steady Despite a Refinery Strike ,2015-02-03,"The United Steelworkers action comes as the nation is awash in fuel, though a lengthy strike could affect two-thirds of production.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/business/energy-environment/oil-and-gasoline-prices-remain-stable-despite-refinery-strike.html

529,"The stock market fell on Monday as oil prices turned sharply lower, prompting investors to sell off shares of drillers and other energy-service companies.

The drop in oil weighed on stocks from the start of trading. Weak trade figures out of China and news that Japan’s recession is deeper than initially thought suggested demand for crude oil would be lower in those two economies. Among the big losers were two Dow Jones industrial average components, Chevron, down 3.7 percent, and Exxon Mobil, off 2.3 percent.

More broadly, the six-month drop in the cost of oil, which has brought prices down to their lowest level in five years, suggests headwinds for the American economy, said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading.

“When you look at the major drivers of global growth — Japan, China and the eurozone — they’re really struggling,” he said. “Can the U.S. continue to grow at a moderate pace when the rest of the world is having major problems?”

Crude oil for January delivery fell $2.79, or 4 percent, to $63.05 a barrel in New York. The energy sector in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 3.9 percent to its lowest level in nearly two years.

Stocks had been rising steadily since mid-October. An encouraging jobs report on Friday, showing the biggest burst in hiring in nearly three years, helped push the S.&P. 500 to a nominal record high that day, capping a seven-week winning streak.

For its part, the Dow came within nine points of breaching 18,000 points on Friday, just five months after passing 17,000.

But Monday’s retreat put that milestone further from reach, as investors were also concerned about economic troubles in Asia and Europe.

In China, the world’s No. 2 economy, the government reported that export growth slowed sharply last month, and imports unexpectedly contracted.

In Japan, revised figures for the July-September quarter showed its economy shrank 1.9 percent, a bigger drop than previously estimated.

In Europe, German industrial production inched up 0.2 percent in October, less than expected. Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is barely growing, up just 0.1 percent in the third quarter.

John Manley, chief stock strategist at Wells Fargo Funds, said that there was a positive side to the oil slump. Falling oil prices mean drivers save money, which could translate into people spending more in stores.

“If Americans have a bit more money, they tend to spend more,” Mr. Manley said.

Among the stocks on the move, McDonald’s, another Dow component, lost $3.70, or 3.8 percent, to $92.61. That was the biggest loss in the blue-chip index. Investors sold after learning that a key global sales figure slipped 2.2 percent in November.

Cubist Pharmaceuticals jumped $26.24, or 35.3 percent, to $100.60 after the company agreed to be acquired by Merck for $8.4 billion. Merck rose 39 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $61.88.

535,"Still, Iraq plays an important role for market stability. With current production of 3.3 million barrels of oil a day, Iraq is the second-largest producer in the OPEC cartel, and it has the potential to become a far larger player on the world stage. Current predictions by the International Energy Agency show Iraqi production growing to 4.4 million barrels a day in 2015 and to nearly 6 million barrels a day by 2020.

That kind of growth will require large amounts of foreign investment to resuscitate Iraqi oil fields that were poorly maintained for decades under the Saddam Hussein regime. The Western oil giants ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Occidental Petroleum and Chevron have plowed significant resources in the southern Iraqi fields and the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. They also have the skilled talent and expertise that Iraq needs and cannot always get from Chinese and other non-Western oil companies investing in the area.

“All the oil companies are on alert,” said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian. “They are going to worry about the security of their people and installations. Obviously, no one is going to do anything new. Confidence about the growth of Iraqi oil output becoming a key element of stability in the world oil market is now in question.”

Already, insurgents in recent months attacked and crippled an important northern Iraqi oil export pipeline, meaning a loss of $20 million in daily revenue for the central government in Baghdad. The new attacks will at least delay repairs of the pipeline. This week the insurgents surrounded the Baiji oil refinery, a major source of gasoline and diesel to central Iraq and to a vital power station that supplies Baghdad. Despite conflicting local reports, it seems that the insurgents have taken effective control of the plant, though they are allowing it to continue to operate for the moment.

As grim as the worst-case situations may be, most analysts still say there is no immediate threat to Iraq’s southern oil fields, which account for approximately 90 percent of the country’s production and oil export. Basra, the heart of Iraq’s oil economy, is situated in an area strongly dominated by Shiites who generally support the central government and are implacable enemies of the Sunni forces on the march in the north.

Badr H. Jafar, chairman of Pearl Petroleum, a consortium that operates in Iraqi Kurdistan, said it was “highly unlikely” that terrorists could disrupt production and operations in southern Iraq. But he predicted that the disruption at the Baiji refinery “is likely to affect the electricity supply to Baghdad.”

Sadad Ibrahim Al-Husseini, former head of exploration and development at Saudi Aramco, said the new terrorist attacks would mean “higher prices for sure and delayed investments in the south.” But he added that they had also created “three fundamental new realities in Iraq” — some of which could be helpful for global markets, at least in the short term.

The Saudi oil man said heavily armed Kurdish militias would now “fill the power vacuum in northern Iraq and take over the disputed giant Kirkuk oil field and other fields around it.” Second, the central Iraqi government will be forced to redirect exports of southern Iraqi oil that once went through Turkey to leave from the gulf. And finally, he said, “the Turkish government will now have no choice but to commit itself to supporting the Iraqi Kurds” in order to maintain security on its southern border and protect Kurdish oil supplies that go through Turkey.

World oil supplies are relatively robust at the moment, which explains why oil price increases have not been significant. Global supplies are up a million barrels a day from a year ago, mostly because of North American production. And OPEC supplies moderately increased in May, as increased Saudi Arabian production compensated for declines in Libyan exports throttled by militia unrest. China has stockpiled large amounts of oil in recent weeks, making a global shortage less likely.

Still, many oil experts expressed concern about the prospects for Iraqi oil production stability and its meaning for world markets. Since oil meets 90 percent of the country’s energy needs and is the main source of the government’s funding, oil infrastructure is a tempting target for any group that wants to destabilize the country. As such, analysts worry that even the Shiite-controlled southern area could be in jeopardy.

Experts note that there have been periodic suicide bombings, albeit of mostly civilian targets, over the last year in southern Iraq, including a truck bombing in a Basra port last August. And just over a month later there was a bombing at the large Daura refinery complex in Baghdad, although the principal target was the mosque inside, and equipment did not suffer serious damage.

“This was a heavily fortified facility,” noted Helima Croft, senior geopolitical analyst at Barclays, “and he got in there.”",Oil Industry in Iraq Faces Setback to Revival,2014-06-14,"&#8220;The collapse of Iraq would bring an international oil crisis,&#8221; an expert says, but so far the oil markets are taking the growing unrest in stride.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/business/energy-environment/oil-industry-in-iraq-faces-setback-to-revival.html

538,"MegaRed is essentially a premium variation of fish oil — a nutritional supplement purchased by roughly one in six American households and swallowed in the belief that it will lead to a healthier heart. “Taking fish oil is not a pleasant experience,” Mr. Faracci said. “It’s a huge pill and a fishy aftertaste. As soon as you take it, there’s a burp back.”

MegaRed’s capsule is smaller, and the company claims its oil is more quickly absorbed by the body. It also comes from Antarctic krill, a tiny crustacean, instead of from larger fish that can accumulate toxins in their bodies.

But the pills are expensive, costing about $57 for a year’s supply, more than double the $25 price of generic fish oil. Big retailers like Walgreen and Costco have also come out with their own brands of krill oil that undercut MegaRed’s prices.

Complicating the sales pitch is conflicting science. The National Institutes of Health say there is some evidence that fish oil can reduce high triglycerides, which are one indicator of high cholesterol and may be a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. But a new analysis of past studies of fish oil by researchers from the University of Auckland in New Zealand, published online in December by JAMA Internal Medicine, found little proof of health benefits. And some research has suggested that high consumption can actually be harmful.

Indeed, R.B.’s lawyers won’t let its marketers claim that MegaRed pills actually lead to a healthier heart. They can only suggest it with scientific-sounding language like “supports three markers of heart health”: triglycerides, C-reactive proteins and the omega-3 index.

Not exactly a thumbstopper.

R.B., a British company that owns big consumer brands like Lysol cleaners and Durex condoms, bought MegaRed in December 2012 as part of its $1.4 billion acquisition of Schiff Nutrition. It was convinced it could increase sales by brightening the stodgy marketing of MegaRed and other Schiff brands like Move Free and Airborne.

Mr. Faracci discovered Facebook’s value in 2012, when he oversaw a campaign for Lysol Power & Free, a version of the cleaning solution with fewer harsh chemicals. The campaign, aimed at mothers, emphasized the health benefits of using a gentler product and generated twice as much in sales as it cost. According to measurements from Nielsen, it made the people who saw it 8 percent more likely to consider buying the product.

Mr. Faracci was convinced that MegaRed could pluck the heartstrings of Facebook users in a similar way.

The goal of the two-day “garage” last August, which Mr. Faracci allowed me to attend, was to come up with specific MegaRed ads that would be compelling enough to grab the attention of a mother or grandmother scanning her Facebook feed on her phone while in line at the supermarket — and eventually, prompt her to buy the pills.

MegaRed had 8 percent of the dollar value of the “heart health” market, which includes fish oil, according to R.B.’s analysis of IRI shopper data through Sept. 8, 2013. But the company’s research showed people didn’t know much about the brand. Once they learned about it through Facebook, Mr. Faracci believed, many of them would switch.

Facebook, which has held around 200 of these sessions with more than 100 companies over the last few years, hosted the meeting in Midtown Manhattan (it has since moved to bigger quarters near Astor Place). The garage brought together about 20 people from R.B., Facebook and the brand’s advertising agencies, Karlen Williams Graybill and MRY.

Before the session began, R.B. and its agencies had settled on a theme: “What does your heart beat for?” The idea was that taking a daily MegaRed would keep your heart going so you could do what was important to you.

MegaRed’s previous Facebook ads drew about one “like” or other interaction for every 260 people who saw them. The company wanted to do a lot better.

The people in the room began tossing around ideas. An image of a sine wave with the sound of a heart beating? Love stories? Music from the band Heart?

No, too literal.

“The things we share on Facebook are stories of the heart,” said Eric Schnabel, a creative strategist from Facebook’s Chicago office who had worked on marketing other products that made health claims, like the cereal Special K.

The team started free-associating ideas for poignant emotional moments. A son’s wedding. Playing tennis every week. Caring for a Harley. Going to a jazz festival. Soon the whiteboard was covered with sticky notes.

Next they stepped into the shoes of two model customers, both female, from two different generations, to help the marketers tailor their pitches.

Agnes was a 65-year-old baby boomer. The team started filling out her profile. She regularly went to yoga and Zumba classes and played golf. She traveled a lot, heading to Vermont for a three-day weekend. She liked to pull out pictures of her grandchildren. She was Facebook friends with her grown-up nephews but her own son had unfriended her.

Linda, a Gen X-er, was 50. She aspired to raise healthy kids, and was worried about her parents’ health. Perhaps she was divorced, trying Match.com for online dating.

Mr. Schnabel laid out a few guidelines. Visuals count. “Great words with an image attached to them are the purest form of expression,” he said.

Story lines that stretch across multiple ads, spread out over days or weeks, could also be very effective. “We try to make them more like ‘Law and Order’ than ‘Game of Thrones,’ ” Mr. Schnabel said. “You don’t need to see every episode in order for it to make sense.”

But don’t overdo it, he warned. Ads that pop up too frequently feel like spam. Facebook itself generally aims to show one ad for every 20 items in a person’s news feed, although users who like or comment frequently on ads might see more.

Discussing Agnes, the fictional grandmother, the group focused on passions she never had time to pursue. One ad could show a couple her age wearing backpacks in front of the Eiffel Tower. Another, learning to cook the perfect meatball in Italy.

A home run would be a message that people liked enough to share with their friends and family — giving a free boost to the campaign.

The most thumbstopping idea of the day came from Roger Lu, a Facebook manager who primarily works on data and ad targeting: A child’s crayon drawing of his grandfather pulling a quarter from his head, with the caption: “Thank you for finding money in my ear, Grandpa.”

“It’s much more emotional and much more unexpected,” said Mr. Schnabel approvingly.

Selecting the Targets

Figuring out the ad content was the fun part. The tension between Facebook and R.B. emerged when it came time to figure out how MegaRed should spend its money.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Modern data collection practices have made it remarkably easy to locate individuals based on what they tend to buy. Online shopping carts and store checkout scanners record purchases, and data brokers like Datalogix gather information from loyalty cards, customer email addresses and other sources to build a profile based on their past purchases.

Facebook and its competitors can match that offline data to their own dossiers on users to help marketers target their pitches and evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns. Although the matching has Big Brother overtones, Facebook says it takes pains to protect user privacy, using a complex process to make individual profiles anonymous before matching them.

At the meeting, Mr. Rodrigues argued that MegaRed’s money would be best spent going after a narrow group of consumers. Tapping into Datalogix’s database of retail purchases, MegaRed wanted to find not just current fish oil users but other people worried about their hearts. Called “lookalikes,” they are signaled by their purchases of products like canned salmon, oatmeal, Cheerios, health supplements, aspirin and blood pressure monitors, as well as by liking Facebook pages on heart-related topics.

The Facebook folks countered that such specific targeting would be very expensive. Under Facebook’s auction system, advertisers compete for limited slots in the users’ news feeds; the more targeted the pitch, the higher the cost for reaching each 1,000 people. With only a small pool of targets, R.B. would be competing with other brands that wanted to reach those same people, forcing it to pay more to be the advertiser that won the slot.

Also, Mr. Prescott argued, the emotional campaign for MegaRed might very well draw in people whose potential interest in fish oil was not readily apparent. MegaRed should show ads to every American woman 45 and older and see who was interested in each one, then place those ads in the feeds of people in the same demographic buckets, he said.

Kyle Benedetti, who at the time was director of sales for SocialCode, an ad management platform working with R.B. and Facebook, said, “We can tell you within the first 15 minutes of a post whether it’s a good post or a bad post.”

In Mr. Faracci’s experience, that ability to shift a Facebook campaign quickly based on immediate feedback was the platform’s biggest strength.

Mr. Rodrigues was more skeptical. “We don’t know whether Facebook is the right tool,” he said.

“Let us take these inputs and see how big these audiences are,” Mr. Schnabel urged. If the broad-brush approach wasn’t working, the data should show that pretty quickly.

Crunching the Numbers

Over the next few months, the creative team produced dozens of specific ads and began putting them into the news feeds of both fish oil users and the broader audience.

In mid-November, shortly after the eight-week marketing campaign had begun, nearly a dozen members of the original team reassembled for a progress report.

One of the first ads targeted at the broad group — the photo of a boy and his grandfather, “being there to push him in the right direction” for his first bike ride — had already drawn more than 18,000 likes and nearly 600 comments.

“My heart beats when my grandkids r happy my 6 year old just learned how to ride his bike n he did it on the 3rd try,” wrote Marybeth Ortiz, a housecleaner from Nevada, whose comment was highlighted in the team’s review (Turns out, though, she never bought any MegaRed.)

Another ad, a scene of ice and snow promoting MegaRed’s Antarctic roots and aimed at heavy vitamin shoppers, had fallen flat, as had some ads aimed at fish oil users.

“I have found that the MegaRed smells and taste WORSE than the generic fish oil capsules!!” Carolyn Davis, a Facebook user in Tennessee, wrote in response to an ad about krill oil’s claimed lack of aftertaste. “It turns my stomach to even open the cabinet I store it in!! As soon as this bottle is gone I will never buy it again!!”

“It’s O.K. that things don’t work,” Mr. Faracci said at the end of the review. “It’s much cheaper than using market research.”

Still, R.B.’s marketers are sticklers for measurement, and the final exam for Facebook would be how the ads did on several crucial performance indicators.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When the campaign was completed at the end of December, it was clear that it had failed on one goal: it had fallen well short of the 100,000 fans MegaRed wanted to add to its Facebook page.

But how Facebook did on the most important measurements — the number of people who saw the ads and the effect on their purchases of MegaRed — would take several more months to assess, requiring Nielsen surveys of people who saw the ads and an analysis by Datalogix of MegaRed purchases by Facebook users in the supermarket.

In April, the results finally came in.

During the eight-week campaign, 18.1 million women aged 45 and up saw at least one ad, according to Nielsen’s research. That was 56 percent of the target audience. The number who said they were now more likely to buy MegaRed rose by two percentage points.

Photo

About one out of every 84 Facebook users who saw the ads liked, commented on or shared them — triple the rate of engagement with MegaRed’s previous ads. That greatly increased the chances that their friends on Facebook would also see the messages.

On the most crucial measure — sales of krill oil — the campaign generated about twice as much revenue as R.B. spent on the ads, according to an analysis by Datalogix. That was better than R.B.’s historical return from TV ads, which the company measures once every year or two.

MegaRed also gained more than a percentage point of market share, with 9.2 percent of the dollar value of the heart-health market, based on R.B.’s analysis of IRI shopper data through Feb. 23. R.B. was also running TV ads, handing out samples and doing in-store marketing at the same time, but the company says the Facebook campaign contributed to the gains.

The campaign’s performance turned Mr. Rodrigues into a Facebook fan, and MegaRed is now running video ads on the social network.

“We need to be where the consumer is,” he said in a recent interview. “And if on top of that, I get a bigger return on my investment, that’s even better.”

Still, television will continue to get most of the marketing budget, both for MegaRed and for other R.B. brands. “We’re never going to stop TV,” Mr. Faracci said. “It has a massive role to play. It is a primary source of entertainment. It has good economics.”

But Facebook has established itself as a powerful complement, he said, sometimes extending the reach of a campaign to millions of people who never saw it on television.

R.B., which has gone through about 10 publishing garages with Facebook, is so pleased that it is escalating its global commitment to the platform. It plans to announce Monday that it will spend at least $100 million on Facebook over the next few years as part of a deeper partnership between the two companies.

“Facebook is a fantastic tool for doing personalized marketing at scale,” said Heather Allen, who oversees all of R.B.’s marketing efforts worldwide. “This will be a successful relationship with us if it really drives business results.”

Facebook has committed an entire team, headed by Mr. Prescott, to work on R.B. campaigns around the world, including Britain, Italy, Brazil, India and Australia. “We’re putting skin in the game with them,” he said.

With legions of other companies yet to win over, Facebook is expanding its publishing garage program internationally and offering other creative consulting services to big brands and ad agencies. “There’s no question that in order to work with the world’s largest marketers, you have to invest resources to do that,” said Ms. Everson of Facebook.

However, Facebook has a million and half advertisers, most of them small. Eventually, she hopes, her company can find ways to teach all of them how to turn their ads into thumbstoppers.

542,"By contrast, little has been said about the role the United States government played in developing new energy technologies. And yet for all the criticism aimed at the Obama administration’s efforts to address long-term energy challenges — and the derision over its failed investments in companies like Solyndra — the government’s most useful role might indeed be to support research and ventures that could deliver a low-carbon future.

“If there is one key lesson from the shale revolution, it is that public investments in technology innovation can bring a huge benefit for both the economy and the environment,” said Michael Shellenberger, the president of the Breakthrough Institute, an advocacy group for sustainable development, in Oakland, Calif.

The Breakthrough Institute has done the most thorough investigation I’ve seen of how three decades of government subsidies for research, demonstration and production helped bring about the revolution.

Interest in shale deposits was driven by a search for gas, not oil.

But the oil embargo gave them a big boost. Congress passed the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, creating the Energy Research and Development Administration — which would soon become the Department of Energy.

This kick-started a period of heavy government investment in research and development to recover gas from shale. The agency provided funds for “directionally deviated” drilling, a precursor to the horizontal drilling used today. It subsidized the development of polycrystalline diamond compact bits to cut through the shale. It performed the first big hydraulic fracturing. Energy Department labs created a multi-well fracking test site.

Research at the Sandia National Laboratories into underground imaging — based on microseismic monitoring once used to detect coal mine collapses — was critical to map fractures and position wells.

George Mitchell, the shale fracking pioneer, got help from the government, including in the deployment of a horizontal well and microseismic mapping.

The government did not always get it right. In fact, research into fracking initially took a back seat to efforts to produce “synthetic fuels” from things like “oil shales” — which to date have delivered little in terms of cost-effective energy.

The government could also stand in the way. Price regulation was a significant barrier to investment into “unconventional” gas deposits until it was freed during the Reagan administration.

Of course, the government assistance would have come to nothing without private entrepreneurs who took risks and followed market signals. Fracking was mostly reserved for gas until gas prices started falling a few years ago, shifting producers’ efforts to oil, which could be exploited using similar technologies.

Yet Washington played a critical part in the story that led to oil’s recent fall.

According to Jim Hamilton, an energy economist at the University of California, San Diego, the world’s real income increased by nearly 28 percent from 2005 to 2013. To keep oil prices stable, supply would have had to increase by over 19 percent. But field production of crude increased by only 3.1 percent.

Supply was kept in check, in part, by unforeseen events: wars across the Middle East, attacks on oil infrastructure in Nigeria, sanctions on Iran. But OPEC’s big producers, like Saudi Arabia, did not increase production, either. Excepting the momentary swoon after the financial crisis of 2008, flat output from the cartel kept prices on the rise for more than a decade.

What brought the arrangement crashing down was American shale oil.

By 2013, the United States was already producing 3.5 million barrels of shale oil. Given the new American supply, high prices could simply not hold. “It was not feasible for the Saudis to defend $100 a barrel,” Professor Hamilton said. “It was a losing strategy. Fracking would have taken more of the market.”

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

A price of $45 a barrel does not portend a great future for American shale oil, which is comparatively expensive to produce. As investment in new shale production dwindles, oil prices are likely to recover.

But even if a bunch of shale producers are driven out of business, the industry — which can add or cut production more quickly in response to price signals — might still change oil markets for good, putting a ceiling on oil prices closer to $50 a barrel than to OPEC’s preferred $100.

“We probably won’t see $100 a barrel for a while,” said Jeff Colgan, a political scientist at Brown University who has studied the evolution of global oil. “Fracking does put a bit of a ceiling on the price.”

An important question is what this will do to efforts to combat climate change.

Just as the surge in natural gas from shale sharply reduced carbon emissions from the nation’s power plants, the plunge in oil prices offers a sobering reminder of the power of markets over policy.

Consider, for instance, that the White House’s middle estimate of the social cost of carbon — which measures the broad damage of putting it into the air, a starting point for debates over a carbon tax — is only about $43.39 per ton of carbon dioxide. That comes to about $18.66 per barrel of crude oil, a trivial sum compared with the significant price drop in recent weeks.

Oil’s swoon could feed directly through to bigger sport utility vehicle sales and more driving. It could blunt the political impetus to tighten fuel emissions standards.

But oil’s gyrations also offer an opportunity. “Reducing our heavy dependence on oil will require us to pay forward the huge return on our 40-year shale investments through a similarly long-term effort to accelerate the transition to fuel cell, electric or some other vehicles,” Mr. Shellenberger said.

The falling price of oil offers an opportunity for the government to raise the cash to do so.

Rock-bottom oil offers a great opportunity to increase the gasoline tax without damaging Americans’ purchasing power. Many Republicans — even those most dismissive of climate change — realize that cheap oil creates an opportunity to raise gas taxes without angering voters.

If enough such Republicans could be found (a risky bet), the swoon in oil prices could be leveraged into a boon in tax revenue that the government could use to pick some of the winners that will help solve the problem.","Behind Drop in Oil Prices, Washington’s Hand",2015-01-21,The Nixon administration laid the foundation of a policy that developed the technology to produce American shale oil.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/business/economy/washingtons-role-in-oil-prices-recent-fall.html

Stocks are trading at record levels, but the market’s gains this week have been modest. On the one hand, signs that the economy is flagging suggest that the Federal Reserve will probably refrain from raising rates until later in the year. On the other hand, if the economy fails to pick up sufficiently, corporate earnings will suffer.

Delta and Intel led the way up after turning in results that beat Wall Street’s forecasts. The price of oil soared to its highest price this year, driving up energy stocks.

For investors, any good news comes as a welcome surprise this earnings season, which is widely expected to be the worst in years. Analysts predict that companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index will report a 3 percent drop in profits. Most of the blame lies with the slump in oil prices over the past year, which has squeezed oil and gas companies, and a strong dollar, which diminishes the value of profits earned abroad when they’re brought back home.

545,"Now economists predict that shortages will get even more acute and inflation, already 64 percent, will climb further. The price of Venezuelan oil dropped this month to $38 a barrel, down from $96 in September.

“Things are going to be even worse because oil keeps Venezuela going,” said Luis Castro, 42, a nurse, standing in line with hundreds of others at a grocery store. He had arrived with his wife and 6-year-old son at 6 a.m., but by 11:30 a.m., they had still not entered. “We’re getting used to standing on line,” he said, “and when you get used to something, they give you only crumbs.”

The shortages and inflation present another round of political challenges for President Nicolás Maduro, who has vowed to continue the Socialist-inspired revolution begun by his predecessor, the charismatic leftist Hugo Chávez.

“I’ve always been a Chavista,” said Ms. Noriega, using a term for a loyal Chávez supporter. But “the other day, I found a Chávez T-shirt I’d kept, and I threw it on the ground and stamped on it, and then I used it to clean the floor. I was so angry. I don’t know if this is his fault or not, but he died and left us here, and things have been going from bad to worse.”

Venezuela has the world’s largest estimated petroleum reserves, and when oil prices were high, oil exports made up more than 95 percent of its hard currency income. Mr. Chávez used the oil riches to fund social spending, like increased pensions and subsidized grocery stores. Now that income has been slashed.

“If things are so bad now, I really cannot imagine how they will be in February or March” when some of the lowest oil prices “materialize in terms of cash flow,” said Francisco J. Monaldi, a professor of energy policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

Mr. Maduro spent 14 straight days in January traveling the globe in an effort to court investment and persuade other oil-producing nations to cut production and push the price back up.

“We have serious economic difficulties regarding the country’s revenue,” Mr. Maduro said to the legislature during his annual address, which had to be pushed back because of the trip. “But God will always be with us. God will provide. And we will get, and we have gotten, the resources to maintain the country’s rhythm.”

After months of toying with the politically taboo idea of raising the price of gasoline sold at pumps here, the cheapest in the world, he said that the time had finally come to do so.

And he reiterated his position that the country’s economic ills are the fault of an economic war being waged against his government by right-wing enemies.

Many economists argue that government policies are a big part of the problem, including a highly overvalued currency, price controls that dissuade manufacturers and farmers, and government restrictions on access to dollars that have led to a steep drop in imports.

Some investors fear Venezuela will default on billions of dollars in bonds, but Mr. Maduro has said the country will pay its debts.

Typically, in an election year like this one, when voters will choose a new legislature, the government showers supporters with goods, like refrigerators and washing machines, or other benefits, like free housing. But now there may not be enough foreign currency to import appliances and construction materials.

In interviews, shoppers did not say they were going hungry. Rather, many said the economic crisis meant eating canned sardines instead of chicken, or boiled food instead of fried because vegetable oil is so hard to get. Many said they ate meat less frequently because it is out of stock or too expensive. Fresh fish can be harder to find, in part, fishermen said, because they find it more profitable to use their boats to sell subsidized Venezuelan diesel on the black market in a high-seas rendezvous instead of hauling in a catch.

But social media in Venezuela is full of urgent pleas from patients trying to find prescription medicine.

Dr. Gastón Silva, the head of cardiovascular surgery at the University Hospital of Caracas, said that because of medical shortages, only about 100 heart operations were performed there last year, down from 300 or more in previous years.

Some patients who had been hospitalized awaiting surgery for a month or more were sent home in November because there were not enough supplies, and the operating rooms remained shut for more than eight weeks, Dr. Silva said, despite a list of hundreds of people awaiting heart operations.

He said the shortages stemmed from the government’s foreign exchange controls, which have kept medical importers from getting access to the money they need to make purchases abroad. Now with the low price of oil further restricting the government’s supply of hard currency, he worried the crisis would get worse.

“We are getting to a breaking point,” Dr. Silva said. “If one thing is lacking, O.K. If there are no automobile parts, we’ll see. Food, that’s problematic. But health care, that’s more problematic. Where will it end?”

Mr. Silva said that a private clinic where he also works had sharply scaled back heart surgeries in the last four months of 2014 because of limited supplies.

Ana Guanipa, 75, a retired government office worker, said that she had searched numerous pharmacies for her hypertension medicine.

“I’ve been looking all month, and I can’t find it,” she said, adding that a neighbor who takes the same drug gave her some. “I take it one day on and one day off so that it will last longer.”

On a recent morning, hundreds of people stood in line outside a big-box store, similar to Costco. Inside, many shelves were stripped clean. The large appliance and electronics section was empty. One aisle displayed hundreds of boxes of a single brand of toothpaste. There was no fresh meat; a cooler was filled with frozen pigs feet.

Most people came to buy only three items sold at government-mandated prices: laundry detergent, vegetable oil and corn flour.

Every purchase was entered into a database, ensuring that shoppers did not try to buy the same regulated staples at the chain for at least seven days.

Soldiers patrolled the line outside, police officers were stationed inside and government officials checked identification cards, looking for fake ones that could be used to cheat the rationing system — or for immigrants with expired visas. An official from the immigration and identification service said that offenders would be arrested.

“This is pathetic,” said Yenerly Niño, 18, adding that she had waited more than five hours to buy the three subsidized products because she could not afford to buy them at the higher prices charged by street vendors.

BOULDER, Colo. — TWO years ago, I spent a month watching engineers inspect the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, one of the world’s biggest, most remote and most complicated pipelines. The endeavor entailed sending a five-ton “smart pig” — a rust-detecting robot — 800 miles across the length of Alaska, like a spitball in a giant straw, as it hunted for signs of metal loss.

Federal law mandates such inspections on all interstate pipelines every five years, but the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the operator of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, inspects its pipeline nearly twice as often. The $2 million pig was capable of scanning the pipe inch by inch, and the company wanted data on every one of the pipeline’s seven billion square inches.

Like all major pipelines, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is monitored by leak-detecting software, which compares the flow of oil going in one end with the flow coming out the other, and scans for sudden pressure drops. And like all major pipelines, it has suffered its share of such leaks and other maintenance woes. But unlike other pipelines, it has never, in nearly 40 years, suffered a leak induced by corrosion — a major threat to aging pipelines. That’s because threats like pits, dents and weld misalignments have been discovered and quickly repaired.

Last week, President Obama vetoed legislation that would have pushed forward the construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. A Senate vote to override the veto fell short on Wednesday. But even foes of the pipeline, which would run from Canada to Texas, have begun to concede that blocking it won’t actually prevent Canada from extracting its tar sands oil. Ours is an energy-thirsty world, and when demand eventually drives up the price of oil, out it will come. If the oil is going to be consumed one way or another, then the only remaining argument against the Keystone pipeline is that of preventing local environmental catastrophes that result from spills. But we’ve got it all backward.

Pipelines are the safest way to move oil. They’re an order of magnitude more reliable than trains, and trains are an order of magnitude more reliable than trucks. So the banners that say “If you build it, it will leak” should also be followed by “But if you don’t build it, you’ll have a lot more leaks.”

That said, there is much we can do to make pipelines even safer. This is especially important now that our pipelines are aging: More than half of them were built before 1980.

We started this debate, before Congress, in the 1960s, when federal oversight of pipelines was first on the table. That followed the explosion of a gas pipeline in Natchitoches, La., that left 17 people dead. The oil and gas industry adamantly opposed new regulations, and since then a sad pattern has emerged: dramatic explosion, calls for reform and powerful resistance.

Twenty years passed before federal law first mentioned the use of smart pigs. In the generation since, regulations have actually gotten laxer, while smart pigs have gotten a lot, well, smarter. They can record tons of information, and capture unprecedented levels of detail, by monitoring magnetic flux leakage, ultrasonic transduction or acoustics. They’re also more agile: They can traverse narrow pipelines and take tight turns. Coatings on pipelines have gotten a lot better, too. Furthermore, leak-detection software isn’t as hiccupy as it used to be, and because operators can now examine smart pig data digitally in one big database, they can monitor corrosion over time, much as a dentist monitors decay on your teeth.

I’m not pro-pipeline or anti-pipeline; I’m for infrastructure we can maintain.

If Mr. Obama wants to take a bold stand, he should agree to accept the construction of Keystone in exchange for demanding stricter pipeline inspection standards, like the ones Alyeska abides by. This would include more frequent inspections (at least as frequent as emissions tests for automobiles in most states), lower criteria for intervening in response to corrosion and requirements that the information be made public. He should ensure that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is properly funded, protected from industry influence and granted increased enforcement powers, including the ability to impose higher penalties. Fines need to be proportional to the oil dollars flowing out of pipelines if they’re going to serve as a deterrent.

This would be a great way to “set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,” as Mr. Obama himself said in his State of the Union address. It’s also what Senator Warren G. Magnuson of Washington, who in 1967 introduced the legislation that granted federal oversight of pipelines, would have wanted. His slogan: “Keep the Big Boys Honest.”

As we continue to debate the merits of a pipeline down the middle of the lower 48, we ought to look at the one that runs down the middle of Alaska. That one, which happens to be the most regulated pipeline in the world, owes much of its good condition to that status. Getting behind a law holding pipelines to higher standards seems an executive act far more courageous than a veto.",Don&#8217;t Kill Keystone XL. Regulate It. ,2015-03-06,"Instead of fighting for or against pipelines, fight for safe infrastructure.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/opinion/dont-kill-keystone-xl-regulate-it.html

Morris A. Adelman, an energy economist who marshaled free-market principles and hard data in arguing that the world’s oil supply was not running out, died May 8 at his home in Newton, Mass. He was 96. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught and researched for 65 years, announced the death on May 15.

Dr. Adelman emerged at the center of national energy debates when petroleum prices shot up after the Arab oil embargo of 1973. In 1974, the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised the price of a barrel of oil to $7 from $2. (Adjusted for inflation, $7 in 1974 would be more than $30 today. On Friday, crude oil was selling for $102 a barrel in the commodities market.)

To diminish OPEC’s power, Dr. Adelman advocated that the United States sow a little confusion. He proposed establishing a system of secret competitive bidding for licenses to import oil into the United States. On the basis of economic theory and experience with oligopolies, he argued that there was a good chance OPEC members would cheat on the public prices they had collaborated to set. As a result, he suggested in articles and interviews, the price of crude might drop and OPEC might unravel.

Dr. Adelman acknowledged the possibility that OPEC would retaliate against the auction system by establishing one overall selling agency. But in an interview with The New York Times in 1975, he said that in itself would be counterproductive because governments would “have the constant divisive job of haggling over market shares.”

The Mobil Corporation, now part of Exxon Mobil, ran an ad on the Op-Ed page of The Times responding to a letter he had written the newspaper. It criticized Dr. Adelman for not acknowledging the crucial role that only oil companies play in the complicated task of getting fuel to the consumer — a function it said they would no longer play in an anonymous auction system. The ad, signed by Mobil’s president, William P. Tavoulareas, called Dr. Adelman naïve for thinking that OPEC members would participate in their own destruction.

Also in response to Dr. Adelman’s secret-bidding idea, some senators and representatives suggested that the United States set up a single purchasing agency to negotiate directly with OPEC. Dr. Adelman dismissed this idea as “absurd” because it would not necessarily diminish OPEC’s power.

The United States policy of not jeopardizing the world’s large oil suppliers — particularly Saudi Arabia, the largest — worked against Dr. Adelman’s idea. “Nobody has the stomach for any resistance,” he told The Christian Science Monitor in 1983.

Dr. Adelman contributed to a debate that has raged almost since Edwin Drake discovered oil in Pennsylvania in 1859. Geologists and others have long insisted that oil is running out, but economists have countered that oil will continue to be found as long as extraction technology advances and the price is sufficient.

Dr. Adelman used the Kern River field in the San Joaquin Valley of California to prove the economists’ point. In 1942, he said, the United States Geological Survey estimated that the field had 54 million barrels of reserves. In 1986, the agency raised its estimate to 970 million barrels, based on what could be recovered by modern technology. (The oil had been there all along but had been unrecoverable at prevailing prices and technology.) Between 1942 and 1986, the field produced 736 million barrels as increasingly better technology made it possible to squeeze more oil from the ground.

His point was that reserve estimates are based on current technology and prices, not just underlying geology. The original geologists were not incompetent, he said, rather, the technology to extract oil vastly improved.

“When will the world’s supply of oil be exhausted?” Dr. Adelman asked. “The basic answer is never.” His point has been proved many times in oil industry history, most recently by widespread use of new drilling techniques that include hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to force more oil from the earth. The federal government estimated that domestic crude oil production this year will average 9.24 million barrels a day, the highest since 1972. As a result of increasing production, oil imports last year fell to 36 percent of United States’ consumption from 60 percent in 2006.

This increased production — and the knowledge gained from it — pushed estimates of domestic crude reserves recoverable at current prices and technology to more than 33.4 billion barrels for the first time since 1976. The increase in natural gas reserves has been even greater: They rose to 2.3 trillion cubic feet in 2013 from 1.3 trillion cubic feet in 2000.

Morris Albert Adelman was born in New York City on May 31, 1917, and graduated from the City College of New York in 1938 with the intention of becoming a science teacher. He served as a Navy ensign in the Pacific during World War II, commanding a landing ship. After the war, he earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard.

His early research was on industrial organization. In 1959, he examined the A.&P. supermarket chain and concluded that it had achieved lower prices because of its size, not because of anticompetitive pricing.

In 1962, he published an influential article on petroleum costs and a book on natural gas supplies, “The Supply and Price of Natural Gas.” His other books included “The World Petroleum Market” (1972) and “The Genie Out of the Bottle: World Oil Since 1970” (1995).

He is survived by a daughter, Barbara Adelman. Dr. Adelman’s wife, the former Millicent Linsen, and his son, Larry, died before him.

In the 1970s, when many Americans were angered by what they saw as OPEC’s greed, Dr. Adelman viewed the organization purely in business terms. “Those fellows are not considerate and they’re not malicious,” he said. “They’re just trying to do the best for themselves, squeezing the goose without killing it.”",Morris A.

Indexes rose from the opening of trade after encouraging quarterly results from Walmart and the media giant Viacom, then flitted up and down most of the day. After four weeks of healthy gains for stocks and several closing highs, a little sideways trading was not unexpected.

“After a move higher so far, so fast, the market needs a pause,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “We need another catalyst to move higher.”

All three major indexes closed ahead after a late-afternoon rally. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.59 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,652.79, a new high. It was the seventh closing high for the blue-chip index in eight trading days.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index just barely rose, gaining 1.08 points, less than a tenth of a percentage point, to 2,039.33. The Nasdaq composite index also closed marginally higher, rising 5.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,680.14.

A slump in the energy sector held back the overall market as oil prices continued to slide. Benchmark United States crude lost nearly 4 percent and is trading at a four-year low.

Energy stocks closed down 1.3 percent. They had fallen more 2 percent, but recovered on news, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, that Halliburton was in talks to buy Baker Hughes, a rival oil-field service company. Baker Hughes shares soared $7.77, or 15 percent, to $58.75.

In other deal news, shares in DreamWorks Animation jumped 14 percent on a report that it is in talks to be bought by the toy maker Hasbro. And Berkshire Hathaway, run by the billionaire Warren E. Buffett, said it was buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble in a deal valued at about $4.7 billion.

Jim Russell, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor, an investment firm, said the deal-making helped keep stocks positive for the day.

“It’s another source of demand for stocks, and presumably from smart buyers,” he said. “It’s lent some optimism to the market.”

Among other stocks making big moves, Walmart jumped $3.74, ending at $82.94 after reporting earnings and revenue that exceeded the forecasts of financial analysts. The 4.7 percent gain was the biggest of any stock in the Dow.

Investors plowed money back into stocks after a slump the week before, encouraged by a 4 percent jump in the price of crude oil and Pfizer’s $15.2 billion deal to buy the drugmaker Hospira.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 200 points, its third big gain this week. The Dow is now up about 700 points, or 4 percent, so far this week.

Pfizer, the giant pharmaceutical company, said it would buy Hospira, a maker of injectable drugs, for $90 a share in cash. The deal is the first by Pfizer since it walked away from a merger with AstraZeneca last year. Like many other large drug companies, Pfizer is trying to generate more sales as its blockbuster drugs go generic. Hospira soared $22.84, or 35 percent, to $87.64, and Pfizer rose 92 cents, or 3 percent, to $32.99.

Oil also had a wild day.

West Texas intermediate crude, the United States benchmark, rose $2.03 to settle at $50.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, continuing a volatile ride that has lasted several weeks. On Wednesday, oil plunged $4.60, or 8.7 percent, to settle at $48.45 a barrel the day after the government reported an increase in crude inventories last week.

Few investors believe the turbulence in oil trading will end anytime soon.

“We’re starting to see some production shifts, but it’s happening slowly,” Ms. Santos said. “Oil is going to keep making these big swings until something is done to deal with all this oversupply.”

Stocks on Wall Street shrugged off more unsettling news in Europe. Greek stocks dropped as tensions between the country’s new left-wing government and the European Central Bank intensified.

Greece’s government insisted it would stick to its anti-austerity agenda, hours after the European Central Bank tightened the screws on Athens by withdrawing a crucial borrowing option for the country’s banks.

Greek stocks dropped 3 percent on the news. European stocks closed mostly flat, after being down more sharply earlier in the trading day.

In other markets, United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.82 percent.

557,"A combination of concerns knocked the stock market lower on Tuesday, ending a two-day run.

Crude oil climbed above $60 a barrel for the first time this year, raising expectations that inflation will go up and take interest rates along with it. Greece’s government remained in a standoff with its European creditors.

“There are some jitters,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group. “Greece is definitely part of it. The other part is oil prices going up. That implies more inflation.”

Major indexes wavered at the outset of trading, drifted lower throughout the morning, then spent the afternoon slowly ceding ground.

Talks between Greece and its lenders reached an impasse, raising concerns about the country’s ability to handle a coming debt payment. Greece will have to scrounge for cash to make a payment of 750 million euros ($838 million) to the International Monetary Fund on May 12.

Among companies turning in results on Tuesday, Kellogg, the maker of Frosted Flakes and Pop-Tarts, reported that its first-quarter earnings fell 44 percent as a rising United States dollar offset sales. The company fell 95 cents, or 1 percent, to $63.18.

Walt Disney’s stock hit a record high after it delivered quarterly results that beat Wall Street’s estimates, thanks, in part, to rising revenue from its Walt Disney World Resort and other theme parks. Last weekend, the company’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron” had the second-biggest domestic opening behind the first “Avengers.” But Disney’s stock eventually gave up its early gain and ended the day slightly lower, down 22 cents at $110.81.

The earnings season has given investors little to celebrate, said Tim Dreiling, a senior portfolio manager at a division of U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Roughly seven out of every 10 companies in the S.&P. 500 have reported results that beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit, according to S&P Capital IQ. Yet more than half have fallen short of revenue targets.

“That’s what is concerning,” Mr. Dreiling said.

Major markets in Europe slumped. France’s CAC-40 sank 2.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX fell 2.5 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.8 percent. European government bond prices also fell, shooting government borrowing costs up.

561,"Stocks advanced on Friday, capping a strong week, helped by a recovery in the price of oil and earnings from the Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants and the sportswear giant Nike.

The Nasdaq edged closer to the nominal high it reached at the height of the dot-com bubble.

Once again, it was the Federal Reserve affecting much of this week’s market movement. The Fed implied at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday that its policy makers were in no hurry to raise interest rates with the economy still growing slowly and inflation extremely low. Friday’s rally was partly an extension of that, strategists said.

“The trepidation in the market before the Fed announcement has disappeared,” said Kristina Hooper, United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investments.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 168.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,127.65. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 18.83 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,108.10.

The Nasdaq added 34.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,026.42, 22 points from the high of 5,048 it hit in March 2000. It has taken the Nasdaq 15 years to recover nominally from the dot-com bubble, while the S.&P. 500 and Dow reached their previous highs, not adjusted for inflation, in 2007 and 2006.

Nike was among the biggest gainers on the Dow on Friday, rising $3.66, or 3.7 percent, to $101.98. Nike beat expectations, but investors focused more on foreign sales that remained strong despite the rising dollar and overseas market volatility.

The rapid rise in the dollar has been a particular sore spot for investors. The dollar is up more than 8 percent against the major currencies, which makes goods made in the United States more expensive abroad and has had a negative impact on sales. The dollar rose to 120.09 yen from 120.76 yen on Thursday. The euro rose to $1.0809 from $1.0668 the previous day.

The latest example was the jewelry maker Tiffany, which cut its full-year profit forecast, saying the higher dollar was making its products less attractive to foreign buyers. Shares of Tiffany fell $3.44, or 4 percent, to $82.93.

“The dollar’s appreciation has been rapid and it’s become a problem for many of these companies who have significant exposure to foreign markets,” said Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist.

Darden said its same-store sales rose 3.6 percent in the most recent quarter, and lifted its outlook for the full year. Its shares rose $1.88, or 3 percent, to $66.75.

Oil also helped the market on Friday. After dropping more than 3 percent on Thursday, the United States benchmark oil for April delivery rose $1.76, or 4 percent, to $45.72 a barrel. Energy stocks rose far more than the rest of the market. The S.&P. 500’s energy sector gained 2 percent.

Oil ended a volatile week up 2 percent even after dropping to its lowest level in six years on Tuesday. Oil inventories are at record highs, but the number of rigs drilling for oil is falling fast and a sliding dollar is making oil a more attractive investment to overseas buyers. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 89 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $55.32 a barrel.

In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 2.4 cents to close at $1.798 a gallon; heating oil rose 1.2 cents to close at $1.734 a gallon; and natural gas fell 2.7 cents to close at $2.786 per 1,000 cubic feet.

564,"I wish I knew where the economy will be heading next year. If I did, I might become rich. But, alas, I don’t — and even if we don’t always acknowledge it, no economists do.

Too much uncertainty clouds the crystal ball to be confident that any particular course of events will play out in the real world. But we do know something about the sources of that uncertainty, and in a season for sharing, I’d like to offer six questions whose eventual resolution will shape the economic year ahead:

■ How much slack really remains in the labor market?

The unemployment rate stands at 5.8 percent. If it continues on its current trajectory, it will have fallen an additional half a percentage point by mid-2015, putting it at a level that some economists see as effectively full employment.

Yet much of the reduction in unemployment reflects a decline in the share of the population in the work force. If a stronger economy were to induce these people to return to work, the recovery would still have a long way to run before we got to full employment. Moreover, millions of those who are counted as employed remain stuck in part-time jobs but want full-time work.

Further improvements in the labor market also depend on whether the long-term unemployed — those who have been out of work six months or longer — will successfully transition into new jobs. Pessimists emphasize that high levels of long-term unemployment proved to be an intractable problem through much of Europe over the last 40 years. Yet more recent evidence from the United States — particularly from the early stages of this recovery — makes me more optimistic that we can get the long-term jobless back to work.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

All of this means we really don’t know how far unemployment could fall without prompting inflation. Get ready for a debate premised on artificial precision about whether the economy can sustain unemployment of 5 or 5.5 percent. That’s the consensus range. But the best research on this question suggests that the lowest sustainable rate could easily differ from our best estimates by a full percentage point or more. Indeed, the Clinton-era boom pushed unemployment below 4 percent without setting off an inflationary surge.

■ Will the Federal Reserve treat its target for 2 percent inflation as a goal or a ceiling?

Officially, the Fed says it is as willing to tolerate the risk that inflation may rise above this level as it has been about inflation undershooting its goal over the last few years. Yet its actions suggest otherwise. Plans to normalize policy — a euphemism for raising interest rates — are already underway, even as the Fed’s own projections suggest that inflation will not breach 2 percent in the next few years.

Higher interest rates could slow the economy. That leads to my third question:

■ How fast does the economy need to grow to stay healthy?

Many commentators assume that a healthy economy grows at an annual rate of at least 3 percent. Yet economic growth in the United States has averaged only 1.9 percent since 2000, and average growth of 2.3 percent during the current expansion has been enough to yield large drops in unemployment. To an important extent, this lower rate has been caused by demographic factors: slower population growth, the end of the transition of women into the work force, and baby boomers retiring.

All told, the work force is growing nearly a full percentage point slower than it was in the 1990s, and this is why 2 percent growth is the new 3 percent. Likewise, much as the economy once needed to generate 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with new entrants to the labor force, that “break-even” number may now be as low as 50,000.

■ Can the American economy keep motoring without help from the rest of the world?

Among the world’s major economies, the United States had the strongest economic growth in 2014. The picture elsewhere is grim. Japan has lurched from optimism about Abenomics — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s program to kick-start the economy — to pessimism as the economy has shrunk over the last two quarters. And Europe hovers on the edge of a double- or triple-dip recession, depending on your definition. China has slowed, with economic growth moving below 8 percent a year from an extraordinary 10 percent. And the Russian economy is on the cusp of a full-fledged crisis. It’s not just that foreign buyers have less money to spend; their weakness has become the dollar’s strength, which also makes our exports more expensive. These global headwinds could easily knock a fragile recovery off course.

■ What will be the consequences of lower oil prices, which have fallen by about half since June?

Typically, an oil price decline is like a tax cut, leaving more money in consumers’ pockets to spend elsewhere. That should spur growth. But since the shale boom, the United States is not only a leading oil consumer but also a leading producer. So lower oil prices also spell smaller revenue for some of our energy companies. And our producers have particularly high costs, so further investment in them may become unprofitable if prices fall too far.

This leads us back to the inherent uncertainty afflicting economics:

■ What, as Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary, asked, are the unknown unknowns?

More often than not, the shocks that buffet the economy come out of the blue. Few predicted the huge swings in oil prices over recent years, and the same goes for the financial crisis and many other disruptive events. A few years ago, for example, the weakness in Greece’s fiscal situation was successfully disguised, until it catalyzed the eurozone crisis. In 2011, the tsunami that brought huge damage to Japan also caused global economic tremors. And while we have often seen political gridlock in Congress, the extreme brinkmanship over financing the federal debt in recent years has been a form of economic self-sabotage that was once unimaginable.

I wish I could offer clearer guidance about next year, but an honest account focuses on the limits of our knowledge. We’re not sure how much further the economy can improve next year, or even if it will actually do so, and we don’t know what might drive it off course.

So instead of a forecast, I’ll offer advice: Prepare for the worst, hope for the best and count on being surprised.","The Big Economic Unknowns of 2015, From Unemployment to Oil",2014-12-28,"No one can predict where the economy will land next year, but a handful of factors will help set its course.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/upshot/the-big-economic-unknowns-of-2015-from-unemployment-to-oil.html

566,"The ground floor still was being used to house livestock when they bought the site, and a chimney intended to funnel the animals’ body heat into the living quarters above was left in place. The stone troughs lining one of the walls also were retained as a decorative feature, as well as the original hardwood hooks used to hang slaughtered livestock. Mas Vida’s walls, made of local stone, are exposed throughout its interior.

A stone staircase that had been filled with rubble was cleared, and upstairs, many of the original stone floors were restored and the kitchen expanded. The couple had additional windows installed throughout the structure.

Fittings, such as doors and a bathroom basin, were bought from famous Barcelona hotels, including the Ritz Carlton and the Aricasa, which has since closed.

During the renovations, the couple cleared the area surrounding the farmhouse that had become overgrown with pine trees, a major fire risk in this Mediterranean climate — and “discovered that the land had originally been planted with vineyards and olive trees,” Mrs. Riera said.

These days the Empordà region is not one of the country’s better-known wine-producing areas. But in 250 B.C. the Greeks first bought wine into Spain in nearby Empuriabrava. And for centuries — until disease wiped out the area’s vineyards — it was one of the country’s viticulture centers, according to Charlotte Rodríguez, who specializes in large estates for Lucas Fox.

Over the years the couple bought an additional 148 acres, 25 of which are now dedicated to vines and 50 to olive groves. The rest is forest, though planning permission has been granted for additional vines and olive trees.

From 1992, when the first vines were planted, it took five years to produce quality wine. Mrs. Riera says the process was surprisingly easy, as the couple had no initial plans for commercial production. “Commercialization and distribution are the hardest part. We started out as pure hobbyists,” she said.

A fierce wind called the tramuntana frequently sweeps down from the Pyrenees, clearing the air and ensuring that the crops are generally disease-free, Mrs. Riera added.

Over the years the couple also built a winery and an underground cellar, both of which were modernized in 2000, as well as a barn for storing agricultural equipment.

Mas Vida now produces four wines under the Protected Designation of Origin, or P.D.O., of Empordà: two chardonnays called “Mas Vida 17” and “117”; a merlot, “Mas Vida 32”; and a blend of merlot, cabernet sauvignon and tempranillo called “Mas Vida 23.” A total of about 14,000 bottles are produced each year.

The estate’s crop of manzanilla, picual, argudell and arbequina olives is turned into 3,800 liters of oil annually by a local cooperative.

Ms. Rodríguez said in Spain it was relatively unusual to find a vineyard with a home of such quality. “In France, you often get the lovely old house with the vineyards — that’s quite rare in Spain. Here you’re more likely to get a cortijo with the olive groves,” she said, using the local word for a luxury villa.

Over all, estates typically are valued according to land quality, which varies enormously depending on factors such as location, sunlight and drainage, rather than the quality of accommodation, she said, adding, “You might top up the price by half a million euros or a million for a really special house.”

There is no central database in Spain with details on wine estate sales, but according to Mrs. Rodríguez, the country is proving increasingly popular with prospective buyers who formerly would have looked in France — especially the sherry-producing areas around Jerez and Arcos de la Frontera. The country’s taxation, which favors landowners, is part of the reason, she said.

“Buyers are much cannier now and better informed than five years ago,” she said. “But they’re not always realistic when it comes to pricing.”

Rafael del Rey, general director of the Observatorio Español del Mercado del Vino, or Observatory of the Spanish Wine Market, said his organization had also noticed increased interest in Spanish vineyards. He attributed it to the commercial potential of wines from major regions such as Rioja, Ribera del Duero and Penedès.

Across the country, buyers have been split between hobbyists and serious producers, with interest among Chinese buyers particularly strong in the latter category. “The Chinese are looking for high volume for their domestic market, as even very average wines are expensive there,” Mrs. Rodríguez said.

But Mr. Del Rey noted that the Chinese interest had not translated into sales.

Among American buyers, the Priorat area in southern Catalonia is particularly popular since the well-known critic Robert M. Parker gave its wine favorable reviews.

Within the Spanish vineyard market as a whole, Mrs. Rodríguez said there was a trend toward buyers’ favoring small, boutique vineyards of less than 50 acres that produce high-quality wine that can sell at a premium.

599,"Forty-one years ago this month, the Arab oil embargo began. The countries that were part of it belonged, of course, to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries — OPEC — which had banded together 13 years earlier to strengthen their ability to negotiate with international oil companies. The embargo led to widespread shortages in the United States, higher prices at the gas pump and long lines at gas stations. By the time it ended, the price of oil had risen to $12 a barrel from $3.

Perhaps more important than the price increases themselves was the new world order the embargo signaled. The embargo “set in motion geopolitical circumstances that eventually allowed [OPEC] to wrest control over global oil production and pricing from the giant international oil companies — ushering in an era of significantly higher oil prices,” as Amy Myers Jaffe and Ed Morse noted in an article in Foreign Policy magazine that was published last year at the 40th anniversary. Twice a year, OPEC’s oil ministers would meet in Vienna, where they would set oil policy — deciding to either hold back or increase oil production. There was always cheating among members, but there was usually enough discipline in the ranks to keep prices more or less where OPEC wanted them.

As it happens, the title of that Foreign Policy article was “The End of OPEC.” Jaffe and Morse are both global energy experts — she is the executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, and he is the global head of commodities research at Citigroup — who say that if America plays its cards right, OPEC’s dominance over the oil market could be over. I think that day may have already arrived.

“OPEC is not going to survive another 50 years,” Morse told me. “It probably won’t even survive another 10. It has become extremely difficult for them to forge an agreement.”

When Morse and Jaffe wrote their article last year, the price of oil was more than $100 a barrel. Today, the per-barrel price is in the low- to mid-$80s. It has dropped more than 25 percent since June. There was a time when $80 a barrel would have been more than satisfactory for OPEC members, but those days are long gone. Venezuela’s budgetary needs requires that it sell its oil at well above $100 a barrel. The Arab Spring prompted a number of important OPEC members — including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — to increase budgetary spending to keep their own populations quiescent. According to the International Monetary Fund, the United Arab Emirates needs a price of more than $80 to meet its budgetary obligations. That’s up from less than $25 a barrel in 2008.

Not long ago, Venezuela asked for an emergency OPEC meeting to discuss decreasing production. Iran has said that such a meeting is unnecessary. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has made it clear that it is primarily concerned with not losing market share, so it will continue to pump out oil regardless of the needs of other OPEC members. This is not exactly cartel-like behavior. The next OPEC meeting is scheduled for late November, but there is little likelihood of an agreement.

And why does OPEC suddenly find itself in such disarray? Simply put, the supply of oil is greater than the demand, and OPEC has lost its ability to control the supply. Part of the reason is a slowdown in global demand. China’s economy has slowed, and so has its voracious appetite for oil. Japan, meanwhile, is increasingly turning to natural gas and nuclear power.

But an even bigger part of the reason is that the shale revolution in North America is utterly changing the supply-demand dynamic. Since 2008, says Bernard Weinstein, an energy expert at Southern Methodist University, oil production in the United States is up 60 percent. That’s an additional three million barrels a day. Within a few years, predicts Morse, America will overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia and become the world’s largest oil producer.

What’s more, according to another article Morse wrote, this one for Foreign Affairs magazine, “the costs of finding and producing oil and gas in shale and tight rock formations are steadily going down and will drop even more in the years to come.” In other words, the American energy industry might well be able to withstand further price drops easier than OPEC members.

When I got Jaffe on the phone, I asked her if she thought OPEC was a spent force. “You can never say never,” she replied, and then laid out a few dire scenarios — mostly revolving around oil fields being bombed or attacked — that might make supply scarce again. But barring that, this is a moment we’ve long been waiting for.

A new report from the International Monetary Fund makes a compelling case for why countries should end subsidies for fossil fuels: It would save millions of lives.

Governments subsidize energy in many ways. Some countries sell gasoline and diesel at prices lower than the cost of producing or importing those fuels. But by far the biggest way countries reduce the price of energy is by not taxing it enough to account for the damage that burning fossil fuels causes to human health and to the climate.

The I.M.F. estimates that calculated properly, energy subsidies will amount to $5.3 trillion this year, or 6.5 percent of the global gross domestic product. China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will be responsible for nearly half of that amount, or $2.3 trillion, and the United States will be the second biggest at $699 billion.

The arguments for cutting subsidies are not new. But the I.M.F.’s exhaustive research makes the case even stronger and more timely. The fund calculates that by raising taxes on fossil fuels, basically eliminating the subsidies, nations would reduce premature deaths caused by air pollution by 55 percent. That would make a big dent in the 3.7 million premature deaths that the World Health Organization links to all outdoor air pollution for just 2012.

The climate would also benefit by reducing greenhouse gases. Eliminating subsidies, the I.M.F. estimates, would cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, by more than 20 percent a year. Another benefit would be to increase government revenue, which could be used to invest in health care, renewable energy, mass transit and other public services.

It would be naïve to expect most governments to completely eliminate energy subsidies. But there are reasons to be hopeful that public officials are becoming more willing to discourage the use of fossil fuels. Last year, for example, the Indian government stopped subsidizing the retail price of diesel to reduce its budget deficit.

Meanwhile, China is trying to reduce coal use for electricity generation in an effort to improve the abysmal air quality in Beijing, Shanghai and other big cities. In the first four months of this year, that country lowered its coal use by 8 percent compared to the same period last year, according to calculations by Greenpeace.

The recent sharp drop in the price of crude oil, coal and other fossil fuels provides an opening for governments to raise energy taxes, because any increase would have a much smaller impact on consumers than it would have had a year ago. In the United States, states like Iowa and Utah have raised gasoline taxes to help pay for road repairs. Congress should also raise the federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon on gas and 24.4 cents on diesel, which has not been increased since 1993, and use the money for road, bridge and transit projects.

There is no good reason for governments to sustain outdated and unnecessary subsidies that cause millions of deaths every year, not to mention the havoc that they are wreaking on the environment.",The High Cost of Dirty Fuels,2015-05-21,"Ending subsidies for fossil fuels would save many lives, a report from the International Monetary Fund makes clear.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/opinion/the-high-cost-of-dirty-fuels.html

HOUSTON — After five tumultuous years at the helm, Steven L. Newman, the chief executive of Transocean, a leading offshore drilling service company, has abruptly stepped down.

The company said late Sunday that the decision was agreed to by Mr. Newman and the company board. Ian C. Strachan, the company chairman, is taking over as interim chief executive while the board searches for a permanent successor.

Transocean’s business and stock price are suffering because of the 50 percent drop in the price of oil since June, which is slowing expensive deepwater drilling. The company is still recovering from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion that left 11 workers dead.

Transocean operated the rig for BP, the operator of the ill-fated well exploration in the Gulf of Mexico that spilled millions of gallons of oil into the sea and soiled hundreds of miles of beaches. A federal judge last year found Transocean to have been negligent, sharing the blame for the accident with BP and Halliburton, another oil services company.

“As chief executive, Steven has capably guided Transocean over the last five years, demonstrating outstanding leadership through what was unquestionably the most challenging period in its history,” Mr. Strachan said in a statement that appeared on the company website.

“Transocean is well positioned to weather the current industry downturn and emerge even stronger,” he said.

Transocean is evaluating the competitiveness of its fleet. It is scrapping seven older rig vessels, and has suggested that more of its fleet may be sold once oil prices revive.

After leaving for a few months, she returned to Kandahar in May 2005 with a project that, on the surface, could never smell of corruption and intrigue.

Armed with an oil press and $25,000 from Oprah Winfrey, she set up a cooperative producing scented soap and beauty products, taking advantage of Afghanistan’s horticultural riches. But she soon found that even this innocuous activity put her on the sharp end of corruption, as she tried to do simple things like deposit money in a bank without paying a bribe for the privilege of doing so. So she began, in an amateurish way, to develop ideas for limiting corruption in places like Afghanistan.

Very quickly, the amateur became professional. Chayes was soon called upon by NATO and ISAF to give expert briefings with a focus on anti-corruption measures. “ ‘Sally the Soap-Maker Gives an Ops Brief’ was how I jokingly came to refer to my main presentation,” she writes. This led to a job with ISAF, and then another as special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, flitting between Washington and Kabul as the United States laboriously and somewhat unwillingly developed an anti-corruption strategy for Afghanistan.

Any such strategy was bound to conflict with political and military exigencies, which presumably explains Kerry’s response to the report in The Times. But Chayes’s Afghan interlocutors told her again and again that poor governance was actually what was perpetuating the conflict, with graft generating disenchantment and driving people toward the Taliban. “Western officials,” she writes, “habitually flipped the sequence: First let’s establish security, then we can worry about governance.”

Ordinary Afghans, meanwhile, took Western inaction on corruption as approval. Aid just added to the problem, in Chayes’s view: “Development resources passed through a corrupt system not only reinforced that system by helping to fund it but also inflamed the feelings of injustice that were driving people toward the insurgency.”

Chayes refers to the body of medieval and Renaissance advice literature known as “Mirrors for Princes” to contextualize current abuses of government. She begins with the most famous mirror of all, Machiavelli’s “The Prince,” but it is lesser-known figures like William of Pagula and John of Salisbury who give her the most ammunition. She also uses the “Siyasat Nameh” — the “Book of Politics” — of the 11th-century Persian administrator Nizam al-Mulk.

Among the counsels that Nizam al-Mulk gave his sultan was: Listen to the griev­ances of your subjects directly, without intermediaries. Chayes argues that the ­voices of a majority of Afghans are drowned out by the Taliban on one side and by the Karzai government on the other. ISAF, she says, listened only to the government.

Many of the other countries Chayes brings into this chatty study (“John of Salisbury, as usual, nailed it”) show similar patterns. In each case, there are slightly different “variations on a theme,” as she has it, ranging from the military-­kleptocratic complex (Egypt) to the bureaucratic kleptocracy (Tunisia), the post-Soviet kleptocratic autocracy (Uzbekistan) and the resource kleptocracy (Nigeria). In her epilogue, titled “Self-­Reflection,” Chayes also discusses Western countries and the global financial crisis of 2008.

This is an important book that should be required reading for officials in foreign service, and for those working in commerce or the military. The story will interest the nonspecialist reader too, though the balance of exciting narrative, academic discourse and policy-wonk-speak will unsettle some. Indeed, Chayes touches on how language itself becomes corrupt. The standard terminology of military and diplomatic engagement (and much corporate rhetoric) is often evasive, with usage reflecting differences in value systems — as when assassination by drone is described as “targeted killing.”

While I am in full agreement with what Chayes says, I found her own prose style raising my hackles on occasion, with its effortful interpolations of color (“the legendary but painfully dilapidated blue and white Mediterranean port city of Algiers”), verbs on steroids (“I wheeled and strode over to our battered red pickup truck, clambered aboard, and roared off to the bank”), and its chapters that begin with such sentences as “Wait a second.” I did, but I wish she had.","‘Thieves of State,’ by Sarah Chayes",2015-02-22,A former journalist and adviser in Afghanistan says corruption is undermining American foreign policy and breeding insurgency.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/books/review/thieves-of-state-by-sarah-chayes.html

DAVOS, Switzerland – The sudden plunge in oil prices has been a boon for consumers, and could be a boon for Goldman Sachs, too, according to Gary D. Cohn, the investment bank’s president and chief operating officer.

As the price of oil has fallen by more than half over the last six months, American consumers have saved billions on lower gas and heating prices.

That extra money in consumers’ wallets was not going into savings accounts, Mr. Cohn said in an interview at the World Economic Forum, but rather toward the purchase of other goods and services.

“The American consumer has gotten the largest tax break in the last few years by falling oil prices,” he said. “That’s been a huge windfall.”

Mr. Cohn acknowledged that thousands of jobs were being lost in the oil industry, as fracking projects shut down and companies lay off employees in anticipation of sharply lower revenue.

But over all, Goldman Sachs has calculated that falling oil prices will push well over a trillion dollars into other industries around the world.

“Net net, the world is projected to save $1.6 trillion this year on lower oil prices,” Mr. Cohn said. “That’s more than $1 trillion going into the global economy.”

Mr. Cohn also said that Goldman stood to gain from the sudden fluctuations in oil prices.

Goldman, already a top adviser on mergers and acquisitions, is positioned to advise on deals this year if the oil industry consolidates. Companies facing sharply lower revenues as a result of the drop in oil prices might need to raise additional debt, which Goldman could also facilitate.

And Mr. Cohn predicted that some of the governments that strongly depend on oil exports would need to issue more sovereign debt.

Mexico, which exports millions of barrels of oil each year, is facing such a situation, and last week issued billions more in new bonds.

“Their budgets may be impacted by this,” Mr. Cohn said of oil exporters. “They may be looking for alternative sources of financing and ways to make their budget work. There’s opportunities in that for us.”",Goldman Executive Says Falling Oil Prices Will Help Firm's Business  ,2015-01-23,"Goldman Sachs has calculated that falling oil prices will push well over a trillion dollars into other industries around the world, said Gary Cohn, the investment bank’s president and chief operating officer.",http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/falling-oil-prices-will-help-consumers-and-goldman-sachs-gary-cohn-says/

675,"Worries about the outlook for growth in China and a slide in the price of oil pushed the stock market to its biggest loss in almost seven weeks on Monday.

Investors are nervous about China after a run of soft economic data that suggested growth there, the No. 2 economy after the United States, was slowing. The worries about China helped push down the price of oil, and that in turn weighed on energy stocks.

The stock market has struggled to gain traction this month as investors have considered signs of an improving economy in the United States against evidence of slowing growth in Europe and Asia.

“We’ve got China weighing down on stocks,” said Kristina Hooper, United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. “The lack of transparency there always creates greater uncertainty.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 16.11 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,994.29. The loss was the biggest one-day decline for the index since Aug. 5. The index is down 0.5 percent this month.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 107.06 points, or 0.6 percent, to 17,172.68. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 52.1 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,527.69.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals yesterday. 17,280 Previous close 17,279.74 17,240 17,200 17,160 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

The losses were broad, and all 10 industry sectors that make up the S.&P. 500 declined. Energy stocks were among the biggest decliners, slumping 1.4 percent as the price of oil fell. Companies that rely the most on consumer spending, like entertainment and media conglomerates and retailers, fell the most.

The price of oil dropped in the face of concerns that Libya’s production was picking up at a time when global economic indicators pointed to weaker demand from countries including China. Crude oil for November delivery fell 78 cents to $90.87 a barrel.

Smaller companies were also among the biggest decliners as investors shunned the riskier parts of the market.

The Russell 2000, an index that tracks small-company stocks, fell 1.5 percent, more than other indexes. The Russell has dropped 3 percent so far this year, compared with gains of 7.9 percent for the S.&P.

Still, analysts noted that the economy appeared to be strengthening, creating a favorable environment for stocks.

“The fundamentals in the U.S. have been coming in strong, beyond expectations,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management. “It’s a modest pullback. If anything I would take it as an opportunity to build positions.”

Stocks were also hurt on Monday by a report that fewer Americans bought homes in August as investors retreated from real estate and first-time buyers remained scarce. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million. That followed four months of gains. August sales fell from a July rate of 5.14 million, a figure that was revised slightly downward.

690,"LONDON — The British government on Saturday hardened its resistance to the Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s attempt to buy the energy subsidiary of the German utility RWE.

Mr. Fridman’s company, L1 Energy, agreed to a 5 billion euro deal with RWE last year, but its completion has been slowed by regulators’ concerns, especially in Britain, that Mr. Fridman or his company might become the target of expanded sanctions on the Russian energy industry stemming from the Ukraine conflict.

Among the prime holdings of the energy subsidiary, DEA, is a British natural gas field in the North Sea called Breagh. The British government is worried that if Mr. Fridman or his company were sanctioned, the field and other North Sea assets belonging to DEA might need to be shut down, creating serious safety and environmental risks.

Mr. Fridman and RWE made concessions to try to push the deal through, but the British Department of Energy and Climate Change said in a statement on Saturday that these steps did not “adequately and surely alleviate” the concerns of the energy minister, Edward Davey, about the effect that possible future sanctions might have on the operations of the British fields. It said that if the deal went through, Mr. Davey was “minded to require the companies to arrange” for the British fields to be sold to a more suitable operator.

The government announcement came just after it emerged that Mr. Fridman was about to hire as the head of L1 Energy John Browne, a former chief of the British oil giant BP who orchestrated a flurry of groundbreaking mergers while there.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Browne, 67, is expected to be named executive chairman of L1 Energy on Monday, according to a person close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the appointment had not yet been formally announced.

The appointment, which The Financial Times first reported, could signal an effort by Mr. Fridman to take advantage of the current low price of petroleum to acquire stakes in oil and gas businesses around the globe.

But Britain’s resistance to the sale could suggest that Mr. Browne will face difficulties in working for Russian investors at a tense time between Moscow and the West. L1 planned to use DEA, which has a global range of assets in places like Germany, Norway and Egypt, and a staff of geologists and other experts, as the platform on which to build a bigger company.

In an effort to overcome British concerns, the companies said in January that the British assets of DEA would be kept separate for a number of years. They also said that for a year after the completion of the deal, RWE would be obliged to buy back the British assets if sanctions were imposed on LetterOne, Mr. Fridman’s holding company, or its owners.

Now, a new price may need to be negotiated, and the sale itself may be at risk. Neither Mr. Browne nor a representative for LetterOne could be reached for comment.

Mr. Browne and Mr. Fridman have had business dealings, at times contentious, dating to the early 2000s, when BP acquired a 50 percent stake in the oil operations of Mr. Fridman and his partners, forming a company called TNK-BP. Mr. Fridman set up L1 Energy in 2013 with the aim of investing the proceeds he and his partners made from selling their share of TNK-BP to the Russian state-controlled energy company Rosneft. L1 Energy is a unit of LetterOne.

At that time, they hired Mr. Browne as a paid adviser, along with Andrew Gould, a former chief of the oil services company Schlumberger, and James Hackett, a former chief of Anadarko Petroleum, an American independent energy company.

Mr. Browne, who left BP in 2007, is known for the deals he led as its chief, beginning with its takeover of Amoco in 1998. Despite building BP into one of the oil industry’s biggest companies, he was among the first oil executives to acknowledge that burning fossil fuels was probably linked to global climate change.

L1 Energy might offer Mr. Browne ample financial firepower at a time when a sharp drop in energy prices has put a wide range of oil and gas assets up for sale. According to LetterOne’s website, it has $29.5 billion under management, with $13.5 billion in telecommunications assets and $15.6 billion in financial instruments that could be used for acquisitions.","Britain, Wary of Sanctions, Adds Pressure to Keep Russian From Buying Energy Unit ",2015-03-01,The completion of the deal has been slowed by regulators&#8217; concerns that Mikhail Fridman or his company might be targeted by expanded sanctions on the Russian energy industry stemming from the Ukraine conflict.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/business/energy-environment/britain-wary-of-sanctions-adds-pressure-to-keep-russian-from-buying-energy-unit.html

Silver Lake, the private equity firm that invests in technology companies, announced on Monday that it had made its first deal related to the oil and natural gas industry as it seeks to capitalize on the North American shale boom.

Silver Lake agreed to buy Quorum Business Solutions, which sells software to oil and gas companies, for $310 million. The sellers are two other private equity firms, the Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings, which bought the business in 2010.

Silver Lake is making the investment through two of its funds: Silver Lake Partners, its flagship buyout arm, and Silver Lake Kraftwerk, its division focused on renewable energy. Together, the two funds are investing $180 million of equity, with two-thirds of that check coming from Silver Lake Partners.

Members of Quorum’s management are also rolling over their stakes into the deal, accounting for about $20 million of equity. The balance of the price will be financed through debt.

While the deal is in some ways a novel one for Silver Lake, it also fits with the firm’s technology-focused strategy. Last year, after a drawn-out fight, Silver Lake bought the computer maker Dell. It is now preparing an initial public offering of GoDaddy, the domain name registration giant that it bought with another firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.

Quorum, which was founded in 1998 and is based in Houston, has built a profitable business in the niche market of energy software, catering to companies across the spectrum of oil and natural gas production. Among other tasks, the software helps companies with financial accounting, transactions and risk management.

In recent years, Quorum has experienced an uptick in demand for its exploration and production software as new drilling operations have set up shop in the Bakken field of North Dakota and elsewhere in the United States and Canada. The company estimates that half of its business comes from new entrants in the industry, while the other half comes from older companies replacing existing technology.

Silver Lake’s strategy involves expanding Quorum’s product offerings through acquisitions. The private equity firm is not planning a significant overhaul of the business but is instead hoping to make smaller additions.

“They have a machine that works pretty well,” said Bryce Lee, a managing director of Silver Lake Kraftwerk. “It doesn’t need fixing.”

Carlyle and Riverstone provided Quorum with its first outside capital. Under those firms, Quorum shifted the payment scheme for its software from an upfront licensing fee and regular maintenance charges to an annual subscription model. In general, investors prize subscription-based software for its predictable stream of payments.

The sale to Silver Lake is subject to regulatory approval.

“The return exceeded our expectations,” Christopher W. Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said in a statement by email. “This is an excellent outcome for our investors.”","Silver Lake Buys Quorum, an Energy Software Company, for $310 Million",2014-07-14,"The private equity firm Silver Lake, which has long had a focus on technology, is seeking to capitalize on the North American shale boom.",http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/silver-lake-said-to-buy-quorum-an-energy-software-company-for-310-million/

698,"More than any of its rivals, Shell has staked its future on natural gas, L.N.G. in particular. Over the last decade, Shell has invested $56 billion in the cooling plants, terminals and other facilities required to produce L.N.G. and other gas-derived fuels.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When Repsol ran into trouble in Argentina, Shell swooped in to purchase the company’s well-regarded L.N.G. business for $5.4 billion. Shell is also developing a large floating L.N.G. installation, called Prelude, to process the output of a gas field off Australia.

With the purchase of BG, Shell is building on that base, adding to existing projects in places like Trinidad and Australia. The deal will enhance the portfolio as well, with BG’s gas discoveries off Tanzania in East Africa, a future growth area where Shell has been unable to establish a foothold.

Both companies are positioned to benefit from the shale gas boom in the United States. BG has a contract to buy L.N.G. from a facility called Sabine Pass on the Gulf of Mexico, owned by Cheniere Energy. Shell has an interest in a facility planned for an island off Georgia.

The greater scale and additional sources of supply should provide an advantage for Shell. The company, already considered a sophisticated L.N.G. trader, would be able to further define its shipping routes and send cargoes to destinations offering the highest price, wherever they are.

So far, the big push into L.N.G. has proved a blessing for Shell, particularly at a tough time for its oil business as well as its refining units. Last year, the company reported $11.3 billion in earnings from L.N.G. and related businesses, about 75 percent of its overall income. By adding BG, Shell expects to increase its L.N.G. capacity by 73 percent in the next three years.

BG, by comparison, has been going through a rocky period since the sudden departure of its chief executive, Chris Finlayson, last year. The company has been particularly hurt in recent months by its operations in Egypt.

To satisfy growing demand stoked by cheap subsidized energy prices, the country’s government, also facing social unrest, diverted the company’s production for domestic purposes. As a result, BG couldn’t get sufficient gas supplies to meet its L.N.G. export commitments.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Since the departure of Mr. Finlayson, Andrew Gould, BG’s chairman, has largely been steering the company. Helge Lund, a former chief executive of Norway’s Statoil, took the helm of BG about two months ago.

Mr. Gould, a former chief executive of the energy technology company Schlumberger, took the lead, negotiating the deal directly with Shell’s chief, Mr. van Beurden.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Mr. van Beurden said at a news conference on Wednesday that after Shell decided to move ahead with the deal, he called Mr. Gould and the two met on March 15 in London, where “we had a very good discussion.”

Mr. Gould told reporters that he and Mr. Lund had looked forward to turning around BG. But when the board and Mr. Lund looked at the Shell offer, they found it too compelling to pass up.

Investors, though, have viewed the deal skeptically, at least initially. Shell’s stock price was off more than 5 percent on Wednesday. The main knock is the 50 percent premium that Shell is paying over BG’s Tuesday closing price, although the stock is well off its high.

A more fundamental concern may be that L.N.G. prices are under pressure from a variety of factors, including oversupply in the market and weaker-than-expected growth in demand from countries like China. Asian spot prices, for instance, have fallen by nearly 50 percent from their 2014 highs.

Most L.N.G. is sold under long-term contracts, whose terms are usually not disclosed. But because they are linked to oil, usually with a several-month time lag, they are also coming down.

That will put pressure on Shell’s profits, particularly on L.N.G. from the high-cost Australian projects to which both Shell and BG have substantial exposure.

“We believe that Shell will have to work very hard to convince shareholders that the strategic benefits outweigh the premium offered,” Iain Reid, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, a Canadian bank, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.",Royal Dutch Shell to Buy BG Group for Nearly $70 Billion,2015-04-09,"The BG Group is a major player in liquefied natural gas, and if the deal is completed, the sale would be a rare bright spot for energy deal makers.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/business/dealbook/royal-dutch-shell-bg-group.html
699,"Financial experts say Russia’s most pressing problem is not the sinking ruble, despite its potential to prompt a run on the banks, nor the falling price of oil, though the annual budget was based on a price of $96 per barrel, which is now hovering around $70.

“This is all peanuts compared to the financing crisis,” said Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister turned opposition politician.

Nearly $700 billion is owed to Western banks, economists said, much of it by the giant state-run companies that constitute the heart of the Russian economy. But sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and adventurism in southeastern Ukraine have blocked access to Western financing.

Despite Moscow’s plans to turn East as an alternative, China’s banks just do not have the capacity. Instead, the debt threatens to drain the Kremlin of its $400 billion in foreign currency reserves.

Among the companies with their hands out are Rosneft, Novatek, VTB Bank, Rusnano and Russian Railways, asking for sums well beyond the $90 billion held by the National Welfare Fund, a sovereign wealth fund for rainy days.

Mr. Putin has yet to express publicly how he expects Russia to emerge from its financial problems. At a news conference last month, he addressed concerns about oil by saying that prices had been high enough in the first part of 2014 to finance much of the Russian budget, and that the country would just have to “wait and see” about next year.

He also tried to portray the large drop in value of the ruble as useful. “We used to sell by the dollar and get 32 or 35 rubles in return, but if you look at today’s exchange rate, we get 45, 47 or 48 rubles for every dollar’s worth of what we sell,” he said, and the ruble has reached 54 to the dollar since Mr. Putin spoke. “In that sense, budget revenue has even increased.”

Vedomosti, the main business daily, published an excoriating editorial on Tuesday comparing Mr. Putin to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who the editorial said did basically nothing as the exchange rate there fell to four trillion Zimbabwe dollars for one American dollar.

While noting that Russia was in far better shape, the editorial said that “the biggest problem of Russian leadership is inability to admit mistakes.”

“The economy is seriously ill, and the ruble rate is one of the indicators crying about the illness,” the editorial said. “Russia’s leadership refuses to admit there is an illness and pushes it into the depths.”

Anton Siluanov, the Russian finance minister, called the report predicting a recession a “preliminary assessment” and said it had not been approved by the entire cabinet. Mr. Siluanov also argued that the ruble was now undervalued after its long slide.

Mr. Putin is due to deliver his annual State of the Nation speech on Thursday, and there has been much speculation that he will announce more liberal or more centralized economic policies. Some economists think that the policy is essentially to wait out the sanctions, with the Kremlin anticipating that they will expire in a year and that then all the financial problems will diminish.

The crisis is still likely to force significant cuts in public spending. The Ministry of Economic Development, which publishes the government’s economic outlook, on Tuesday revised its 2015 forecast to show a contraction of 0.8 percent, compared with a previous projection of 1.2 percent growth. Private assessments said there could be a drop of 2 percent.

The setbacks have slowed or eliminated goals to achieve higher wages, better health care and cheaper housing, ambitions laid out in a series of populist decrees Mr. Putin signed on his first day in office for a third term, in 2012.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The 11 decrees described a “transformation strategy for society” for his new six-year term, including creating 25 million “highly productive” jobs, raising life expectancy to 74 years and raising the birthrate.

“Russia is in an economic crisis,” said Kirill Rogov, an independent economic analyst. “Of course, all those grand plans are irrelevant now.”

It is impossible to predict whether the economic woes might inspire antigovernment demonstrations. There have been minor protests in Moscow by medical professionals denouncing the closure of about 28 clinics in the capital and the dismissal of 10,000 medical staff members.

But the effects of the economic crisis are just starting. Once constituents like pensioners realize the ruble is losing its purchasing power, they can be expected to demand raises so they can buy as much as before. But state companies will be first in line.

“The problem is that he cannot deliver on his economic promises, so he has to deliver on post-imperial nostalgia,” Mr. Guriev said of Mr. Putin. “He will say that we are not rich anymore, but we are at least feared.”

The annexation of Crimea lifted Mr. Putin’s ratings into the stratosphere, raising concerns that he might try similar moves elsewhere, like Moldova, to distract people if the economic crisis deepens.

The crisis and three rounds of Western sanctions seem to have produced a distinct shift in the propaganda on state television and elsewhere, from triumphalism to a determination that Russians are ready to make any kind of sacrifice to win a showdown with the United States.

A billboard on the main Sadova ring road around Moscow recently proclaimed, “There are more important things in life than the financial market,” and made references to Russian history.

“They are moving from greatness to suffering hardship, because we are fighting American domination,” Mr. Milov said. “It is a totally different definition of the mission.”","With Russia on Brink of Recession, Putin Faces &#8216;New Reality&#8217; ",2014-12-03,"Plunging oil prices, capital flight and a devalued ruble present a challenge to a president who an economist says &#8220;has always been lucky.&#8221;",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/business/russia-forecasts-a-recession-in-2015-signaling-a-toll-from-sanctions-and-oil-prices.html

In an attempt to shrink a persistent stock market discount, Mr. Li is merging his main holding company, Cheung Kong, with its 50 percent owned subsidiary Hutchison Whampoa into a new company called CKH Holdings. The combined company will leverage up and spin off its property assets.

A straightforward swap would have reduced the Li family’s stake in the enlarged holding company to around 29 percent, from 43 percent today, according to Breakingviews calculations. Dropping below 30 percent would limit the family’s ability to control the business and prevent it from adding to its stake without making an offer to independent shareholders.

That’s where the Husky deal comes in. Mr. Li is exchanging a $1.3 billion equity stake in Husky, a Canadian energy group, directly owned by his family for shares in the enlarged holding company. The extra equity lifts the family’s stake in CKH Holdings – and in the subsequent property spinoff – above the 30 percent threshold.

A few months ago, shareholders in Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa might have balked at accepting shares in Husky, which were then trading at a five-year high. But the collapse in the oil price since has knocked about a quarter off the value of Husky shares. The result is that Mr. Li has to part with a bigger stake in the Canadian group. However, it makes the trade look more attractive for independent investors who must approve the broader restructuring.

Investors added $5.4 billion to the value of Cheung Kong by midday on Jan. 12, shrinking the discount to the holding company’s book value to 13 percent, from 24 percent before the deal. It confirms that there is value in restructuring Mr. Li’s empire. If the Husky swap helps him keep control, it will rank as one of the tycoon’s slickest trades.

DealBook readers: The Breakingviews predictions book for 2015, “Animal Spirits and Crisis Ghosts,” is a collection of pithy commentary that reflects two conflicting sentiments coexisting in finance and economics. Stocks and other assets keep recording solid, but not yet outlandish, price gains, which have encouraged mergers, initial public offerings and shareholder activism. At the same time, policies inspired by the global financial crisis in 2008 are restraining certain industries, in particular banking, where regulators want bigger, and therefore more expensive, capital cushions.

A fight for control of a major oil field services company appeared to be brewing on Friday, as Baker Hughes disclosed that its larger rival Halliburton had threatened to replace its entire board.

The move by Halliburton came after an impasse in merger talks between the two, which if completed would be one of the biggest energy deals in years. As of Friday, Baker Hughes had a market value of more than $25 billion.

But Baker Hughes said in a statement that it felt increasing pressure from its competitor to accept a takeover bid in a short time frame, and it was not satisfied with the proposed price or other terms of the offer.

“Baker Hughes is disappointed that Halliburton has chosen to seek to replace the entire Baker Hughes board rather than continue the private discussions between the parties,” Martin Craighead, Baker Hughes’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “Baker Hughes believes that Halliburton’s various attempts at coercive tactics, instead of being willing to negotiate a reasonable value for the company’s stock and despite having stated twice that they have room to increase the value of their offer, are attempts to control both sides of a negotiation and are entirely inappropriate.”

A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Emily Mir, declined to comment.

Discussions between the two companies have been taking place during a steep drop in crude oil prices this year, driven by the surge in domestic energy production that has generated a glut of oil and natural gas.

Shareholders have worried that oil field services providers would face pressure from oil and gas producers to lower prices, clamping down on profit margins. Those concerns drove the jumps in both Halliburton’s and Baker Hughes’s stock prices after The Wall Street Journal and others reported on the talks.

Shares in the smaller company have risen nearly 18 percent over the last two days, closing on Friday at $59.89. Shares in Halliburton were up almost 4 percent during that same time, ending Friday at $55.08 and giving the company a market value of $45.4 billion.

Baker Hughes said in a statement that Halliburton made an unsolicited takeover proposal on Oct. 13, one that the bigger oil field company said would ultimately yield some $2 billion in cost savings. Talks continued, but Halliburton refused to raise its bid, the value of which Baker Hughes did not disclose.

Another issue at the heart of the discussions was figuring out how many assets the combined company would need to sell to appease antitrust regulators. The two oil field service providers are among the biggest in their industry, surpassed only by Schlumberger.

Three messages between the two companies, publicly released by Baker Hughes, suggest that Halliburton was well aware of a Friday deadline to nominate directors for its takeover target’s board. Mr. Craighead repeatedly suggested in messages to his counterpart at Halliburton that he believed the offer was too low.

Moreover, Mr. Craighead added that his company wanted a so-called termination fee payable by Halliburton if any deal between the two fell apart.

Matters appeared to have culminated by Thursday. In an email sent that day, Mr. Craighead wrote that he would not accept a demand to accept the takeover offer within four hours.

SÃO PAULO, Brazil – The fallen Brazilian businessman Eike Batista will face criminal charges in court on Nov. 18, a Rio de Janeiro judge has decided.

The federal prosecutor in Rio de Janeiro, where Mr. Batista’s oil company OGX has its headquarters, charged Mr. Batista last month with profiting from insider information when he sold shares in OGX. Mr. Batista is also accused of manipulating OGX’s stock price by promising to buy $1 billion in stock and then refusing to fulfill that commitment.

Mr. Batista’s lawyers had tried to dismiss the charges, arguing that there was no evidence of crime and that the federal court had no jurisdiction. The judge, however, denied their arguments on Monday and set the trial date.

Mr. Batista is also facing a separate criminal investigation in São Paulo, where OGX shares were listed. Brazil’s securities regulator, the CVM, is conducting a civil investigation.

While OGX was issuing optimistic reports about its petroleum exploration, its shares on the São Paulo exchange reached a high of 23.39 reais in October 2010. By the time the company acknowledged in July 2013 that several of its largest oil fields had proved economically unviable, its shares were worth 0.56 real.

OGX subsequently defaulted on $5.8 billion in debt, much of it owned by overseas investors, including the bond giant Pimco.

Mr. Batista contends that he had no insider knowledge about the petroleum fields and that he sold shares only to meet creditors’ demands. He says the collapse of his various companies ruined him, and that he is now working to make his creditors whole.

His net worth was once estimated at over $30 billion, and unlike most Brazilian billionaires, he flaunted his wealth. He raced speedboats, socialized with celebrities and parked both a Mercedes McLaren SLR and a Lamborghini in his living room.

The country is now watching his downfall with a mix of disbelief and gloating.

Mr. Batista told the Brazilian press in September that his net worth was now negative $1 billion and that “returning to the middle class is a gigantic shock.”

That comment led to a wave of jokes on Twitter under the hashtag #EikeClasseMedia, or EikeMiddleClass. One post said: “It’s a good morning when you wake up and find out you’re in the same class as Eike Batista.” Another said: “If Eike is middle class, what am I? I don’t want to know the answer.”

If Mr. Batista is found guilty, he could go to prison for 10 years or more. While no one in Brazil has ever gone to jail for insider trading, Gilberto Braga, a finance professor at the IBMEC-Rio business school, said it was possible Mr. Batista would face heavy penalties.

Mr. Braga said the involvement of a shareholder association and several prosecutors’ offices was a novelty in financial crimes investigations in Brazil and might indicate that the country’s traditional leniency on white collar crime was ending.

He added that the case’s notoriety, which he likened to the Enron case in the United States, set it apart in Brazil.

WASHINGTON — The United States trade deficit fell in November to the lowest level in 11 months as crude oil imports dropped to a two-decade low.

The trade deficit narrowed to $39 billion in November, down 7.7 percent from a revised October deficit of $42.2 billion, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. United States exports slipped 1 percent to $196.4 billion as sales of commercial airliners fell.

Imports dropped even faster, falling 2.2 percent to $235.4 billion, which was primarily a reflection of foreign oil declines. The volume of crude oil imported in November hit its lowest level since 1994, while the average price dropped to a two-year low.

The United States trade deficit is being helped by falling global oil prices and a boom in American energy production, which has decreased the country’s reliance on imports.

The November deficit was the lowest since a trade gap of $37.4 billion in December 2013. Through the first 11 months of 2014, the deficit is 5.1 percent above the same period in 2013.

The payroll processor ADP also reported on Wednesday that American businesses increased hiring last month, in the latest sign that the nation’s economy is expanding despite worries about global growth.

Balance of Trade The deficit is the excess of imports over exports for goods and services. Amounts are rounded, in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted. November 2014 Imports Exports Balance $235.35 billion 196.35 –$ 39.00 billion $260 billion Imports 220 180 Exports 140 ’13 ’14 $ 0 – 20 Trade deficit – 40 – 60 12-month moving average

Private companies added 241,000 jobs in December, ADP said, compared with 227,000 in November. That suggests that the government report on December job gains, to be released Friday, will also be healthy.

The ADP numbers cover only private businesses and can differ from the government’s more complete report, which includes government agencies.

As for the deficit, economists say they believe that it will keep rising in 2015, reflecting an expanding American economy that will import more foreign products than United States producers will sell overseas. American manufacturers are grappling with weakness in major export markets like Europe and Japan, as well as a strengthening dollar, which makes American goods more expensive for foreign consumers.

A rising trade deficit acts as a drag on economic growth, but economists are still forecasting that overall growth next year will be stronger than in 2014.

In November, the politically delicate trade deficit with China dropped 8 percent to $29.9 billion but remained on track to set a high for the year. America’s deficit with China is the largest for any country. It has added to pressure on Congress and the Obama administration to take tougher actions against what critics see as unfair Chinese trade practices.

The widening trade gap with China comes at a time when the administration hopes to finally get Congress to approve the fast-track authority it needs to wrap up a major 12-nation trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

754,"LONDON — In a sign that Egypt’s strained relations with the international oil industry may be improving, BP said on Friday that it had reached an agreement to invest with a partner about $12 billion to develop natural gas resources in the country.

The oil company, based in London, said it would develop a large quantity of offshore gas, equivalent to about one-quarter of Egypt’s output, and bring it onshore to be consumed by customers. Gas from the project, called West Nile Delta, is expected to begin flowing in 2017. BP said that additional exploration might lead to a doubling of the amount of gas available.

“The project underlines BP’s commitment to the Egyptian market and is a vote of confidence in Egypt’s investment climate and economic potential,” the company said in the announcement.

The deal is a potential boon for the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the former military chief who has been in power since 2013. BP is also taking a very different approach to the Egyptian market than rivals like BG, another British company.

BG and Eni, the Italian oil and gas company, together with Gas Natural Fenosa of Spain, built major liquefied natural gas facilities in Egypt for the export market, but the plants have been largely idled as domestic gas consumption has soared.

BP figures that serving the domestic market for gas, a fuel used by industry and residential customers, makes more sense in a populous, developing country like Egypt than investing in export facilities.

“A transaction of this scale shows that Egypt’s energy policy has turned a corner,” said Catherine Hunter, a London-based gas analyst at IHS, a market research firm.

Since the ouster of Egypt’s longtime president, Hosni Mubarak, in 2011, international oil and gas companies have been increasingly at odds with the government.

The oil companies have been major investors in Egypt, helping it double gas production from 2003 to 2009 and making the country one of the leading producers in Africa, along with Algeria. But output has been declining in recent years, as companies worried about political turmoil said there were insufficient incentives for investment. Domestic consumption of natural gas has quickly caught up with output, almost eliminating exports.

Shortages of natural gas, partly a result of high consumption stoked by low, subsidized prices, have forced Egypt to seek fuel supplies abroad, including from the Israeli offshore developments led by Noble Energy, a company based in Houston. Tight supplies have also led the government to curtail exports of liquefied natural gas, eating into the profit of the likes of BG.

In addition, the government, not known for promptly paying its bills, has fallen into substantial arrears on payments it owes the companies for the oil and gas they produce.

Mr. Sisi, who has the confidence of some parts of the Egyptian business community, has made some strides in energy overhaul, including raising prices. The government, which controls oil and gas sales, has reduced its i.o.u.s to the companies but not eliminated them.

BP estimates that Egypt owes about $3 billion to the industry, with a third of the total owed to BP. The companies said that Egypt was making payments, but Andrew Gould, the chairman of BG, which was owed about $700 million at year’s end, recently told reporters, “We need the balance to go down further.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Industry executives also said that Mr. Sisi’s increase in prices was needed to encourage investment in exploration and production.

In agreeing to invest a substantial amount of money in Egypt, BP is betting that Mr. Sisi will continue to keep prices at levels where they at least encourage companies to invest in gas production.

BP says it will receive $3 to $4.10 per million B.T.U.s for the gas from its new projects, which it expects to produce five trillion cubic feet of gas. That amount is more than the price of gas in much of the United States, but it is substantially less than Egypt would most likely need to pay for imports of liquefied natural gas.

The economics of the BP project will be helped by using BG’s existing gas pipelines and infrastructure in Egypt to help cut costs.

779,"But a majority of the major companies are managing to survive by increasingly using techniques traditionally more common to manufacturing plants than to oil fields to achieve economies of scale.

In some shale fields where companies typically drill up to eight wells on each production pad, companies are no longer drilling one well at a time. Using rigs that can move on tracks or legs, they are drilling and completing several wells at a time, slashing the time it takes to drill each well.

The result has already been a slower decline in domestic shale oil production than many experts had expected, and the promise of a spike in output if the global market price continues to rise as it has in recent weeks.

The Energy Department still expects the average daily production for the year to be moderately higher than in 2014, rising from 8.7 million barrels a day to 9.2 million.

“We can’t control the commodity prices, but we can control the efficiency of our wells,” said Ben Mathis, Statoil’s Eagle Ford operations manager. “The industry has taken this as a wake-up call to get more efficient or get out.”

Using new fiber-optic sensors thousands of feet below the ground, operators are receiving streams of data allowing them to analyze rocks in real time to make quick decisions.

The sensors can determine how far a fracturing job is penetrating hard rocks to plan the spacing of wells more accurately. That way, producers are assured that one well is not draining oil from another and that no significant section of the shale is left untapped.

And by keeping track of temperatures, pressure and vibration on equipment that is out of sight, sensors and advanced software can predict when equipment needs servicing before it breaks down.

“You are more efficient because you are forced to be more innovative,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant. Mr. Pouyanné estimated that the break-even price for operating in 75 percent of the shale oil fields a year ago was $75 a barrel, but that is now down to roughly $60 because of innovation and lower service company costs. He predicted that the break-even cost could go as low as $50 before long.

Companies like BP, Chevron and Devon Energy have turned to GE Oil & Gas to help improve exploration and production controls to save power and keep equipment running longer and more efficiently.

The company is deploying meters that can determine how much water is mixed with gas and oil before production even begins. A harder pump rate brings up more water and oil, but water is expensive to treat at the surface and reinject in disposal wells. When oil prices are low, the operator can decide not to produce wells with high water content but save them for completion when prices recover.

Related Coverage of Oil and Its Economic Impact

Developing new variable-speed controls and algorithms that determine the flow of wells, GE Oil & Gas has figured out ways to turn on and off pumps that formerly operated 24 hours a day, cutting fuel consumption by up to 20 percent. With lower pump use, repair and maintenance costs have fallen enough to bring down the cost of production by two or three dollars a barrel.

In the case of Whiting Petroleum’s Bakken shale holdings in North Dakota, new speed controls on its well pumps reduced equipment repair downtime by 48 percent and helped increase the productivity of its wells by 28 percent in recent months.

“Our industry is very slow to adapt to change, so these shake-ups can be good for challenging operators to find better ways to do things,” said Ron Holsey, general manager for automatization and optimization for GE Oil & Gas.

One of GE Oil & Gas’s most active partners in cutting costs is Statoil. Using a concept the company calls “the perfect well,” Statoil collects data from its own wells and those of partners and competitors and then holds seminars for its employees to determine which drilling and fracking techniques work best.

Statoil is testing new ways to drill and complete wells more efficiently, including replacing diesel for power with natural gas coming from the same field. It is also testing ways to reduce shipments of sand and water in hydraulic fracturing that break and keep open fissures in shale rocks so oil can ooze out. One way is to use bubbly liquefied carbon dioxide to replace some of the water in hydraulic fracturing, a technique Statoil will test this summer in North Dakota.

“These things we are working on are everlasting,” said Bill Maloney, the Statoil executive vice president in charge of development and production in North America, “because the perfect well doesn’t go away when the price of oil goes back up.”",Drillers Answer Low Oil Prices With Cost-Saving Innovations,2015-05-12,"Even as boom towns go quiet, oil production chugs along thanks to rapid gains in technology to extract more with less.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/business/energy-environment/drillers-answer-low-oil-prices-with-cost-saving-innovations.html

784,"Among the most consistent and vocal opponents here have been Native Americans, by far the largest minority group in the state with about 9 percent of the population. They plan to challenge the route’s recertification this summer when it goes before the State Public Utilities Commission in a hearing that begins July 27. They contend that the project has changed since 2010, and that the company should have to start the permitting process from scratch, rather than seek a renewal.

TransCanada says the 313-mile route through South Dakota would steer clear of reservations and tribally owned lands. But on the expansive Rosebud Indian Reservation, the path would be much closer than many are comfortable with. Even if the pipeline would not cross their property, tribal leaders say, it would pose a threat to drinking water and to ancestral homelands on the rolling plains and hilly riverbeds where they still hold treaty claims.

“We’re so frustrated to the point of breaking,” said Wayne Frederick, a Rosebud Sioux tribal council member.

So strong is their opposition that members have maintained a spirit camp on tribal property near the planned route. Despite the camp’s rustic accommodations — a tent, a trailer and no running water — members have kept a vigil there for more than a year, and have vowed to use the site as a base camp for protesters if construction ever begins. Several activists, including Mr. Frederick, have said they would risk arrest through civil disobedience.

At one point, Keystone XL’s path through South Dakota seemed a foregone conclusion. Unlike in Nebraska, the company quickly received a state permit and eventually secured rights to build. But as opposition spread elsewhere and delays mounted, an unlikely group of South Dakotans coalesced in opposition to the project.

Like other landowners along the proposed path, Paul Seamans signed an easement allowing TransCanada to build the pipeline on his land outside Draper, near the central part of the state. Mr. Seamans said he had qualms when he signed, but figured that the pipeline was going to be built anyway and that he should take the best price available.

After signing, Mr. Seamans soured further on the project, and began attending anti-pipeline meetings with Indian tribes. A grass-roots group he heads, Dakota Rural Action, has emerged as one of the state’s most vocal organizations opposing the pipeline. Mr. Seamans said he hoped the new alliance could stall the project.

To some in the state, the opposition has proved baffling. Several South Dakota politicians have signaled their support for Keystone XL, and some landowners along and near the route say they look forward to the tax revenue a pipeline would bring. Many also say they trust TransCanada’s repeated assurances that the project would be safe.

“I didn’t think it would drag out this doggone long,” said Tyrone Moos, a South Dakota farmer whose land is not along the route but who has leased some of his property to TransCanada for use during construction. “I have some concerns, too. But they swore up and down that if there’s any leaks or damage to the land, ‘We will take care of that.’ ”

Jim Doolittle, a rancher who raises cattle in the state’s northwestern corner, signed an easement with TransCanada early on. He said he has remained enthusiastic about the project. Though he has doubts that Mr. Obama will approve the project, Mr. Doolittle said he believes the permit will be recertified.

“I really don’t think that whenever this happens in South Dakota,” he said, “that it’s going to all of a sudden turn around.”

But Native American opponents portray the fight against Keystone XL as a necessary battle that transcends the pipeline issue.

Ms. Spotted Eagle, the Yankton Sioux official, said the pipeline violates her tribe’s treaty rights to land across wide swaths of South Dakota. To allow Keystone XL to go in the ground, she said, would not only imperil the water, but also serve as another affront to the state’s Native American population.

Ms. Spotted Eagle signaled that the outcome of the hearing this summer might not be the final word. If TransCanada’s South Dakota permit is recertified, she and other Native American leaders have said a lawsuit will probably follow.

“I think it’s going to be a spiritual victory,” Ms. Spotted Eagle said, “and we’re not going to back down.”",Grass-Roots Push in the Plains to Block the Keystone Pipeline’s Path,2015-05-06,A new round of hearings on a state construction permit for the Keystone XL project is expected to pit South Dakota activists against pipeline supporters eager for construction to begin.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/us/grass-roots-push-in-the-plains-to-block-the-keystone-pipelines-path.html
785,"Its quantitative model accurately assessed that risk remained low. “There was some turbulence in October, but our model suggested it was only middling, and it wasn’t time to do anything,” said Peter Lee, senior research scientist and co-portfolio manager of the Tactical Market Fund. “This very disciplined approach has stood us in good stead. It takes the emotion out of investing.”

Whether the fund can repeat last year’s success remains to be seen, since it’s little more than a year old. (AlphaSimplex has two other liquid alternative mutual funds with longer track records and just started a global macrofund.) The firm’s model currently shows that risks in the United States market are rising. “We’re still at 130 percent but we’re close to ratcheting that down,” Mr. Wilkinson said. “We’re watching very carefully for the contagion risk of developed non-U.S. markets.”

Whither Bonds?

If 2014 was a tough year for active stock managers, it was even worse for fixed-income managers. A year ago, almost everyone expected higher rates, including a bearish Bill Gross, a founder of the investment firm Pimco, who told me then that investors should expect “slim pickings"" and stick to cash or low-yielding money market funds. (It was an especially turbulent year for Mr. Gross, who abruptly left Pimco and joined Janus Capital Group.) His advice for this year is much the same, “Be cautious and content with low positive returns in 2015,” he recently wrote in his monthly newsletter.

In what has to be considered the biggest market surprise of 2014, interest rates dropped sharply and bonds rallied. The Barclays United States Aggregate Bond Index returned just under 6 percent. United States Treasuries with longer maturities fared even better.

Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management (and a widely followed market analyst), was one of the few to forecast lower rates last year in his annual list of “surprises” for 2015.

This year, in what he called “the polar opposite of what I saw last year,” he’s predicting no less than the “end of the three-decade bull market in bonds,” he told me this week.

“Rates will go lower at first,” he said. “That will shock people, and everyone will throw in the towel on higher rates.” (So far, he seems to be right about that.) But, he said, once people realize that the European Central Bank’s stimulus policies are too little, too late, he expects European rates to rise, followed by those in the United States. “You could see a spike in European rates without any improvement to their economies,” he said. “Italian sovereign debt interest rates are lower than in the United States. That’s insane.”

A fund that capitalized on lower rates last year was Delaware Investments’ Extended Duration Bond Fund, which returned over 17 percent.

This year, Delaware’s fixed-income specialists are predicting a modest rise in rates, to just over 2 percent for 10-year United States Treasuries. “We feel the fundamentals suggest rates can stay in the low 2 percent area, and could end up lower because of dislocation in other markets,” said Roger A. Early, Delaware’s co-head of fixed-income investments.

He said he was “open-minded” about whether the Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds rate this year, as nearly everyone expects.

“With some of the stress we’ve seen, relative to energy and commodity prices, and with deflationary trends in places like Europe, if those continue, I don’t think it’s a given the Fed will move interest rates in the second or third quarter.” (The Fed hinted as much in the minutes of its December meeting that were released this week.)

“The market may be surprised that the Fed takes a step back and doesn’t move forward so quickly,” Mr. Early continued. “We believe United States economic growth is still quite fragile. So current low yields can be sustained for some time.”

Whither Oil Prices?

In nearly every forecast for the year, the wild card is oil. The steep fall in 2014, from more than $100 a barrel to less than $50, surprised and rattled many investors, stoked fears of deflation and battered emerging market economies, even as it put more cash in consumers’ pockets. Almost no one saw it coming, but one who did is Michael Levi, senior fellow for energy at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of “The Power Surge: Energy, Opportunity and the Battle for America’s Future.”

“Early in 2014, oil prices had been high and steady for a long time, and people extrapolated that this would be indefinite,” Dr. Levi told me this week as prices fell below $50 a barrel. “That didn’t make any sense.”

Looking ahead, “Anything is possible,” he cautioned, “but all the conditions for high volatility remain in place. That’s the natural state of the oil market unless a cartel is in control. Part of the lesson from last year is that a small mismatch in supply and demand can result in a large and rapid change in prices. That works in both directions. If there’s an increase in global growth, geopolitical disruptions or a faster shutdown in North American production, then oil prices could definitely go up.”

798,"The cover story of The New York Times Magazine on Sunday, “The Wreck of the Kulluk,” by McKenzie Funk, is one of those articles that you can’t put down even though you know how it turns out. The Kulluk was an offshore exploratory drilling rig, owned by Royal Dutch Shell, which, in December 2012, ran aground in some of the most inhospitable waters in the world.

Those waters were the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in the Arctic Circle, more than 1,000 miles from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, the nearest deep-water port. The rig, which had been towed — with great difficulty — to the Beaufort Sea, was in the process of being towed out again, barely two months after the drill bit touched the sea floor, before ice formations would make the route impassable. The Kulluk and its tow soon ran into a series of dangerous storms. Although no one died, Funk keeps you on the edge of your seat by describing in detail the hair-raising ordeal, which led to the tow captain of a rescue tugboat cutting the Kulluk adrift to ensure his own men’s safety. The Kulluk’s crew, meanwhile, was airlifted via helicopter, in a dramatic, and dangerous, rescue.

Funk also does a nice job laying out all the mistakes Shell made. Despite spending $6 billion preparing to explore for oil in this remote part of the world, it didn’t plan adequately, and it cut too many corners. According to the Coast Guard, which investigated the Kulluk disaster, not only had Shell’s risk management been “inadequate,” but there also had been a significant number of “potential violations of law and regulations.”

I came away from Funk’s article, however, with another thought: Even if Shell had done everything right, what were the chances of something bad happening to the Kulluk, or, more broadly, to any drilling program in that part of the Arctic? They were high. Although this area is considered to hold one of the last great oil fields — with an estimated 23 billion barrels — is drilling for it really worth the risks?

The first issue is the weather. One of the reasons this remote location is at least theoretically accessible to oil companies is because of climate change. “There is less ice, and it is receding from the shore,” said Michael LeVine, the Pacific senior counsel of Oceana, an environmental group dedicated to preserving the world’s oceans. But, he adds, climate change is also affecting the wind, the water and the currents. An area that was already remote, cold and dark is something else as well: unpredictable. Companies trying to explore for oil in the region are essentially flying blind.

Then there is the question of whether the government is up to the task of regulating such high-risk ventures. The answer is: probably not. Even after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico — and despite some improvements in safety regulations — government regulation is still way behind the oil industry. “The technological capabilities and the need for oil companies to drill in more remote places has outstripped the government’s ability to keep up with it,” LeVine told me.

There are a host of important environmental issues: the industry hasn’t gotten better at dealing with oil spills since the Exxon Valdez spill 25 years ago, for instance. Yet because the climate is so difficult, the chances of an environmental calamity are increased.

As regular readers know, I am hardly opposed to drilling for oil or gas. Yet this particular high-risk venture seems both foolish and unnecessary. For one thing, the world is awash in oil, thanks to a slowdown in demand and increase in supply because of the fracking revolution. For another, the price of oil is so low as to make new, expensive exploration in the Arctic unprofitable.

Most of all, though, we’re just not ready to drill for this oil. As LeVine put it, “I don’t believe we have the technological capability to extract these resources safely.” To me, that is the real moral of the story of the Kulluk.

Oil companies, of course, are fundamentally built to find oil. Shell had once embraced climate change and the need for renewable energy. But it eventually realized that it lacked the proper expertise, and it got rid of its investments in wind and solar to refocus on oil and gas. Now, like every other big oil company, it must explore for oil in evermore hostile environments, because those are the only fields left untapped. Despite its travails with the Kulluk, Shell has submitted a plan that would have it going back to the Chukchi later this year.

The oil in the Arctic Circle isn’t going anywhere. If, two decades from now, we need it, maybe by then the industry and the government will be in a position to drill for it — and regulate it — safely. But maybe we’ll get lucky. Or smart.

807,"For all that, though, Mr. Roiss says he does not see how either Austria, which still holds a stake of roughly 32 percent in OMV, or the broader European Union can physically replace the gas from Russia in the short term. At present, about 60 percent of Austria’s gas supplies come from Russia, and OMV’s pipeline network serves as an important transit hub for about a third of the Russian gas exported to Europe.

Most analysts agree that Gazprom cannot be easily replaced. European gas production is declining while other possible sources, like significant exports from the United States, are still some years off.

“I doubt it will be possible to reduce Russian gas imports significantly below the import levels of the early 2010s up to 2020,” said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

Still, a wedge may be forming between Gazprom and customers like OMV that might eventually change the equation. Even if there were no tensions over Ukraine and the downed jetliner, distributing Russian gas is no longer an attractive business. In recent years, companies like OMV have been stuck buying Russian gas under long-term contracts and then selling it at sometimes lower market prices.

Last year, OMV’s gas and power unit barely eked out a profit of 1 million euros, or $1.35 million, in its gas and power unit, despite revenue of about €12 billion.

“The gas market is a difficult business,” Mr. Roiss said. “We see our strategy as concentrating on equity gas,” he said, referring to gas that OMV finds and markets itself. “We will get more gas out of the North Sea. We will get more gas out of the Black Sea.”

OMV’s growing portfolio also includes Rosebank, a roughly $10 billion deepwater oil project being developed at the edge of the North Atlantic west of the Shetland Islands, a project the company entered through the Statoil deal. OMV now owns 50 percent of Rosebank. Chevron, the American company that discovered the oil, is the project’s manager with a 40 percent stake.

Rosebank almost went off the rails last year when the soaring costs of equipment and personnel in the region led the developers to question whether it made economic sense. There was “a bit of a rough patch” between the two companies, said David Latin, the OMV executive in charge.

OMV says that costs have been pruned and the project is now looking more feasible. But the episode shows that Mr. Roiss now has OMV playing in the high-risk petroleum major leagues, which are dominated by bigger companies like BP and Royal Dutch Shell.

The company plans to spend €3.9 billion annually — more than double the €1.7 billion it earned on €42 billion in revenue last year — as it increases production by nearly a third to about 400,000 barrels per day by 2016. That aggressive spending plan has led to investor worries about whether there will be sufficient cash left over to continue paying OMV’s dividend, which was €1.25 a share last year.

Those concerns may have weighed on OMV’s stock price, which is down nearly 10 percent this year, closing Tuesday at €31.41.

The North Sea and North Atlantic forays may help OMV learn how to handle other exploration projects, especially in Romania, analysts say. “I see one benefit if they learn to prepare a deep offshore project,” said Tamas Pletser, an oil analyst at Erste Bank in Budapest, referring to skills that could translate to the Black Sea.

OMV is particularly eager to finally make a return on the controlling stake in Romania’s Petrom that it acquired for €1.4 billion in 2004. OMV has spent a decade making over the lumbering, corruption-ridden relic of the Communist era. Petrom now furnishes about 60 percent of OMV’s oil and gas production and offers some promising future prospects.

In 2012, a joint Exxon Mobil/OMV Petrom well in the Black Sea off Romania found a substantial amount of gas — an estimated 1.5 trillion to 3 trillion cubic feet — in a deepwater block called Neptun. The companies plan to drill a second well this year.

Romania’s prime minister, Victor Ponta, is intent on building up the country’s domestic oil and gas industry, which — unlike those of most other Eastern European countries — already produces the bulk of the fuel it consumes. That is one reason Romania has not had much interest in being part of Gazprom’s South Stream pipeline project.

“I think being independent and having our own resources is always better than being part of a project like South Stream,” Mr. Ponta said in an interview.

For OMV, if the Black Sea waters off Romania and Bulgaria hold large amounts of gas and perhaps even oil from alluvial deposits of the prehistoric predecessors of the Danube River, then completing South Stream through Austria could turn out to be a strategic move.

That is because South Stream would cross the Black Sea. If the European Union eventually does let the South Stream project proceed, analysts expect European officials to allow it only under the condition that the pipeline also be able to carry non-Russian gas.

In that turn of events, OMV gas from the Black Sea might flow through South Stream to Austria. And Gazprom would have invested tens of billions of dollars in a pipeline that helped loosen the Russian company’s own grip on the European market — and on OMV.

“I think OMV has been quite wise in terms of their corporate interests,” said Ilya Zaslavskiy, an analyst at Chatham House, a research group in London. “They may wind up having Gazprom pay for infrastructure that can actually lessen dependence on Russian gas.”",An Austrian Company in Gazprom’s Grip,2014-07-23,"As the European Union weighs sanctions against Russia, the Austrian energy firm OMV is caught in a bind.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/business/energy-environment/an-austrian-company-in-gazproms-grip.html

814,"The argument for aggressive deployment of bioenergy assumes that it is carbon-neutral because plants pull CO 2 back from the air when they grow, offsetting the carbon emitted from burning them as fuel. But diverting a cornfield or a forest to produce energy requires not using it to make food or, just as important, to store carbon.

“Burning biomass instead of fossil fuels does not reduce the carbon emitted by power plants,” a group of 78 scientists wrote on Monday to Gina McCarthy, the E.P.A.’s director, warning against the new power plant policy. “Burning biomass, such as trees, that would otherwise continue to absorb and store carbon comes at the expense of reduced carbon storage.”

If the critics are right, the hunt for biomass on a large scale could vastly change the world’s land use, food supply and ecosystems while helping little to prevent climate change.

The argument for caution has so far mostly fallen on deaf ears. The reason is that policy makers see little choice.

Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change rendered its latest assessment of scientists’ collective understanding of how to slow the pace of global warming. Riddled with the usual uncertainties of science, it seemed pretty certain of one thing: Doing it without biofuels would be much harder.

Absent a big increase in bioenergy supplies, the climate change panel’s analysis reported, it would cost about two-thirds more, on average, to prevent the earth’s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, generally considered the tipping point for climatic upheaval.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The availability of biofuels makes more difference to the ultimate price tag, the panel concluded, than whether electricity generation can be harnessed successfully to the sun and wind. Only carbon capture and storage technology is more important.

In most of the climate change panel’s models that bring temperatures back under the 2-degree ceiling by the end of the century, biofuels are assumed to produce about 250 to 350 exajoules of energy a year.

To put that in context, 300 exajoules is over half the world’s current energy consumption. Today, the energy content of all the biomass harvested for food, fodder and everything else amounts to about 220 exajoules.

The question is, Where will the land to produce all this additional vegetation come from?

As a committee of the European Environmental Agency noted, to reduce the amount of CO 2 in the air, bioenergy production “must increase the total amount of plant growth, making more plants available for energy use while preserving other benefits.”

André Faaij, an expert on energy systems at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and author of many important assessments used by the panel on the potential for bioenergy, argues that it is definitely feasible.

The world could feed 35 billion people (the earth’s current population is seven billion) if only the productivity of agriculture and livestock in the developing world were brought to developed country standards, he said. “Mozambique could feed all of Africa if it just increased its productivity to that of the Netherlands.”

Photo

That could free up a lot of land. Deploying just 10 percent of the world’s five billion hectares currently used for crops and pastures to grow biofuels could generate 100 to 150 exajoules by the end of the century. An additional 60 to 70 could be had from planting biofuels on currently degraded land. The rest could come from better harvesting of forests and the use of organic waste.

In a recent research article, Professor Faaij and colleagues calculated that it would be technically possible to get about 100 exajoules by 2050 from what they call “surplus forest growth,” meaning the bits of forest that are neither protected nor already exploited for wood, and wood waste.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This sort of calculation drives Mr. Searchinger up the wall. “Surplus forest growth” he said, is already pulling CO 2 from the air. Harvesting it for energy will provide no further benefit for climate change. The same could be said of idled agricultural land, where forest usually starts regrowing soon, capturing carbon from the air.

“In many contexts, allowing a forest to grow will do more to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for decades than producing bioenergy,” he told me.

And he finds the estimates of future agricultural productivity unbelievable when applied to any reasonable understanding of the real world. Indeed, it will be hard to maintain the productivity growth of the last several decades, he says, let alone substantially increase it.

“Because the world needs to produce 70 percent more of virtually all the products of land — crops, grasses and wood — by 2050, there is no additional room for bioenergy, and any capacity to increase crop yields and to make better use of any underutilized land is already needed for these other purposes,” Mr. Searchinger said.

Professor Faaij says the skeptics are wrong, arguing that the alternatives to a huge increase in biofuel production would be even more difficult to achieve.

But it could be possible to produce the zero-carbon energy the world will need without incurring such steep opportunity costs. Much of the transport fleet could be electrified, reducing demand for liquid fuels. Solar power could be used to produce hydrogen to burn in fuel cells.

There is probably a limited role for biofuels from waste products. But the biofuels juggernaut — which has helped garner the support of agribusiness in the battle against climate change — could end up doing more harm than good.

The United States used to rely heavily on bioenergy for transport: 100 years ago, tens of millions of acres were devoted to growing feed for pack animals. Since then, much of this land has reverted to forest. Razing it again for fuel is not the best idea.",A Biofuel Debate: Will Cutting Trees Cut Carbon? ,2015-02-11,"Governments across the world are incorporating bioenergy into transportation fuels, hoping to limit dependence on gasoline.

815,"In the hopes of jump-starting stagnant production through increased investment, the company has signed or is negotiating financing agreements with numerous foreign oil companies operating here. These agreements give the companies greater say over how drilling operations are run and how they buy supplies and equipment, as well as greater control over spending and profits, according to those familiar with them, some of whom asked not to be identified to preserve relations with Pdvsa.

“If the previous Pdvsa had signed something like that, Chavistas would have accused them of treason,” said Francisco J. Monaldi, a professor of energy policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, referring to the followers of Mr. Chávez, who died last year.

One of the first agreements was signed with the American company Chevron in May 2013. The deal included a $2 billion loan by Chevron to Pdvsa to cover the state oil company’s portion of investment in an oil field across Lake Maracaibo from Mene Grande.

But it also included provisions sought by Chevron to guarantee that the new loan, as well as millions of dollars in unpaid dividends from past operations, would be paid promptly from oil revenues, according to an oil industry consultant in Venezuela briefed on the agreement and Mr. Monaldi, who was shown a summary of the contract.

The deal also provided for tighter controls over how the loan would be spent and allowed for greater flexibility in running the joint project, they said.

Several other oil companies have renegotiated their agreements with Pdvsa along similar lines, several people familiar with the deals said. And while the oil companies remain minority partners with Pdvsa, under terms dictated by Mr. Chávez, the new agreements give the companies a greater say in running Venezuela’s oil fields than they have had in years, according to people in the industry. That includes allowing for greater leeway in buying supplies and hiring subcontractors, without going through Pdvsa-controlled subsidiaries, a frequent source of delays and corruption.

The recent loan agreements also generally include provisions that would allow disputes to be resolved through international arbitration or in New York courts under New York law, according to the people familiar with them. That is a departure from the operations contracts that govern the joint ventures, which are subject only to Venezuelan law, they said.

“These are contracts signed out of necessity,” said Carlos Bellorin, a senior analyst at IHS Energy, a London consulting firm. “They don’t have enough cash flow to invest in exploration and production or enhancing production in existing projects.”

Repeated requests to interview officials at Pdvsa were denied.

Mr. Maduro recently removed the longtime head of Pdvsa, Rafael Ramírez, a favorite of Mr. Chávez, who ran the company for nearly a decade. But Mr. Ramírez remained in the government, becoming the foreign minister, and a close lieutenant of his was named to lead the company, suggesting that at least for now there may be no major changes in how it is run.

In response to questions about the financing agreement, Chevron said in a statement that it “will assure cash for on-going operations and new development, as well as distributions to shareholders, including current outstanding obligations.”

If oil is the lifeblood of modern Venezuela, then Mene Grande, with a population of about 21,000, is the place where the heart started pumping.

There were earlier attempts to drill for oil in Venezuela, but in 1914 Zumaque 1 (said to be named for the sumac trees that grew nearby) became the first successful well. Drilled by a company that was quickly bought by Royal Dutch Shell, it was also the start of the long reign of foreign oil companies in Venezuela.

“A new era in the country starts here,” said Manuel Pérez Gil, the official historian of the municipality that includes Mene Grande. “With Zumaque there is a before and an after, from a country that produced cocoa and coffee, we became an oil-producing country.”

Soon the country was gushing oil. By 1925, oil made up 41 percent of exports, up from 2 percent in 1920, according to “The Paradox of Plenty,” a study of oil-producing countries by Terry L. Karl. By 1928, Venezuela was the largest oil exporter in the world. By 1935, oil made up 91 percent of the country’s export income.

The country’s economic dependence on oil has only grown in recent times. Today Venezuela has the world’s largest estimated oil reserves and oil makes up more than 95 percent of export income. It is the fourth largest foreign oil supplier to the United States.

But oil has been a roller coaster ride for Venezuela. With prices soaring in the 1970s, the country was swimming in oil money, President Carlos Andrés Pérez nationalized the oil industry and politicians predicted a golden future. Then prices plummeted in the 1980s, and by the end of that decade riots broke out in Caracas, the capital, incited by hunger and failed expectations.

When Mr. Chávez was elected in 1998 the price of oil was less than $10 a barrel. But it would rise to more than $100 and Mr. Chávez used the oil bonanza to finance his socialist-inspired revolution.

The Zumaque well was spiffed up for its 100th anniversary on July 31, with a new coat of paint and a mini-shrine to Mr. Chávez’s revolution. Information panels, like those in a museum, criticize earlier governments for giving too much control to foreign oil companies and credit Mr. Chávez with “laying the foundation for true Oil Sovereignty.”

“Everything that we have in Venezuela comes from oil,” said Nilson Durán, 49, a cattle rancher who brought a friend to see the well. Taking control of oil fields from foreign companies was Mr. Chávez’s most important achievement, he said.

Another visitor, Roberto Morón, 40, a partner in a building supply store, said that Mene Grande should have received more from the oil taken from its soil.

“Things around here should be a lot better,” he said. “There are so many wells here. Mene Grande gives and gives, and it gets nothing.”","Venezuela, in a Quiet Shift, Gives Foreign Partners More Control in Oil Ventures ",2014-10-10,"The country&#8217;s economy is struggling, as is its once-booming government-run oil monopoly, Petroleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/venezuela-in-a-quiet-shift-gives-foreign-partners-more-control-in-oil-ventures.html
816,"Any changes to Gazprom’s practices would also challenge a key pillar of President Vladimir V. Putin’s economic and geopolitical strategy by limiting Russia’s ability to set prices that favor some customers and penalize others. This, in turn, would hamper Moscow’s efforts to use the promise of cheap gas to divide Europe and break its already shaky unity on Ukraine.

“This is a huge step for European energy security,” said David Goldwyn, a senior energy official in the State Department during the first Obama administration. “The days of Russia controlling the ultimate destination of its gas is coming to an end.”

A case against Gazprom would represent the second major move of late by Europe’s powerful antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager. Last Wednesday, she filed formal charges accusing Google of abusing its dominance in the market for online search in Europe.

Ms. Vestager warned in a speech last week that she was prepared to conduct “competition enforcement” in European energy markets. Although she did not name Gazprom specifically, she said there was a need to act “decisively against energy companies that harm rivals, block energy flows from one E.U. country to another, or threaten to close the tap.”

The European antitrust investigation began with surprise raids in 2011 on Gazprom offices and those of several of its customers, as investigators sought information on pricing and contracts. A year later, in September 2012, Joaquín Almunia, Ms. Vestager’s predecessor, opened a formal antitrust case.

One plank of the case focuses on pricing, including whether Gazprom is imposing unfairly high charges by linking gas prices to those of oil, rather than to global natural gas market rates. The authorities also want to determine whether the company is blocking gas flows to some parts of Europe and thwarting customers’ efforts to diversify their supply.

Gazprom’s willingness to wield its power was on display during midwinter “gas wars” in 2006 and 2009. When the company stopped providing fuel to Ukraine, it created shortages in Europe.

Lithuania is among six European Union member states that have long been dependent on Russia for all their gas — although Lithuania has established a gas-import terminal to break that monopoly. The others are Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia and Bulgaria, according to the European Commission. Over all, the European Union depends on Russia for about one-third of its natural gas.

While Brussels and Gazprom have been in negotiations over the case, they failed to produce a settlement. And the European Commission had been wary of bringing formal charges.

One European concern was that an antitrust action could prompt Moscow to harden its line on Ukraine, as the West sought to resolve the fighting between Russian-backed separatists and the government in Kiev. The sanctions against Russia have only made penalizing Gazprom an even more diplomatically fragile issue.

Although there are no Western sanctions on Gazprom’s natural gas exports to Europe, both the European Union and the United States have limited some financing to Russian finance entities like Gazprombank. They have also limited the export of some energy exploration technologies to Russia.

The formal charges against Gazprom could result in a fine. Theoretically, it could run higher than 10 billion euros, or $10.7 billion, although European Union antitrust penalties have never gone that high.

The larger worry for Gazprom would be the prospect of being forced to allow more competition in markets it has long controlled. The company, for example, could eventually have to drop conditions in its contracts that restrict those utilities’ power to share the gas with other countries. That would give individual countries more control over whether they consume all the gas themselves or sell some of it on to other countries, including Ukraine, something Gazprom has opposed.

The charges would just be a first step. Gazprom would then have the chance to lay out its defense, and it could even still settle the case.

The company has proffered commercial arguments for securing long-term contracts with national utility companies and controlling pipelines to deliver the gas. Gazprom has argued that such deals are necessary to obtain bank loans to finance its long-term and sizable capital outlays for developing gas fields in Siberia and shipping fuel to Europe.

Any effort to unravel this model, the company has warned, will inevitably result in diminished investments in the gas-rich regions of Russia, and ultimately to a smaller supply of energy to Europe. “The unified export channel is a backbone of Gazprom’s export strategy,” a company has said on its website of its business.

Still, Russia’s leverage in European gas markets has been dwindling for years, whittled away by lower global gas prices from new shale fields in the United States and big liquefied-gas export projects in Qatar. The European Union has also been trying to encourage diversification of energy supplies, in part to ensure that giant gas producers like Gazprom do not control transport and sales.

Consider the development of the South Stream pipeline.

In recent years, Gazprom’s plan to build the pipeline from Russia — under the Black Sea to Western Europe, bypassing Ukraine — became a focus of dispute. Gazprom insisted that the pipeline would enhance Europe’s energy security. The European Commission, seeing it as an effort to further tighten Russia’s market hold, would not give its blessing to the project without major concessions from Moscow.

Bulgaria was to be the point of entry to Europe from the South Stream pipeline. But the European Commission and the United States heavily pressured Bulgaria to back away from the plan.

With little chance of a resolution in sight, Mr. Putin said in December that he would bring gas through Turkey instead. While negotiations between Ankara and Moscow are proceeding behind closed doors, it is still unclear how a Turkish pipeline would overcome European objections.",Europe Is Expected to Bring Antitrust Charges Against Gazprom,2015-04-21,"Gazprom is expected to be accused of abusing its dominance in natural gas markets, and countries like Lithuania and the United States have been pushing for a crackdown.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/business/international/europe-is-expected-to-charge-gazprom-in-antitrust-case.html
817,"“I feel for the olive growers in Italy, especially small producers who put so much passion in their oil,” Mr. Di Palo said. “This year was like a punch in the stomach. It’s not a monetary question; it’s their life’s work.”

The looming scarcity of olive oil will affect the entire chain of production, from olive mills down the line to exporters, and has fueled concerns about fraud and adulteration that could blight the reputation of a business worth about $2.5 billion for Italy.

Then there are the nagging worries for farmers and others about how to plan for what they fear are permanent changes to the climate that threaten to undercut a pillar of Italian identity over the long term.

Gerardo Gondi, another Tuscan olive oil producer, whose family estate, the Fattoria di Volmiano, has a pedigree that dates to the 15th century, said that more than 18,000 olive trees had not yielded a single usable olive this year.

The estate’s olive press, a traditional stone mill also used by local farmers, fared little better. In 2013, the mill processed 20,000 kilos of olives a day for two months, he said. “This year, we’ve reached maybe 20,000 kilos for the entire season.”

“It wasn’t meant to be an olive oil year,” he mused. “Everything that could possibly go wrong did.”

His pain was widely shared. Here in Calenzano, about 12 miles north of Florence, production was down about 80 percent. Some farmers did not even bother trying to harvest; it was not worth the cost.

Many local farms are organic and did not use pesticides to stave off the fly. Biological methods were ineffective because the persistent rains made mass trapping more difficult and required nearly constant reapplications of various sprays, like fruit fly bait and kaolin clay.

Many olive oil presses here, as well as elsewhere in Tuscany, did not even open.

While some Tuscan towns opted to call off their annual olive celebrations, Calenzano’s administrators felt it was important for its festival — now in its 19th year — to go on.

“It’s a tradition, and we didn’t want to lose our link with local farms,” said Damiano Felli, the council member responsible for agriculture and economic development.

But an olive oil festival without olive oil left little to celebrate.

Mr. Gondi joined other local producers at a large community hall over two November weekends. But all he could offer at this stand was the last remaining bottle of the 2013 harvest and pamphlets showcasing his estate, which over the years has diversified to offer agritourism lodgings and walking tours.

“It was an ethical choice to not produce” what would have been substandard oil, he said. “It’s what our grandfather would have done.”

Truth be told, few of the local producers at the festival had any of their own olive oil to sell. Some were peddling secondary products — wines, biological spelt, legumes, honey — that might tide them over to next year and, the hope is, a better crop.

Others were hawking Sicilian or Greek olive oil, even as they murmured sotto voce that, though the oil was good, it just was not the same as their homegrown products.

Olive oil labels must specify the origin of the olives, indicating whether they are from Italy, the European Union or abroad. But the drop in production has been spurring suspicion of substitutions and scams.

“Concerns about fraud are higher when economic circumstances are negative, so the temptation is greater,” said Fedele Verzola, commander of the Florence branch of the military police unit that investigates major food and health fraud.

Speaking on a recent weekend in Calenzano at a seminar on olive oil fraud, he called on local farmers to be “sentinels of this patrimony — not spies” and to report any suspicions about possible adulterations.

But the real fear in these parts is that the weather has become permanently unpredictable, and that the debacle of 2014 is but a taste of years of bad harvests to come.

“This is global warming; people continue to say that it will take many years for the weather to change, but the rain, the flooding and everything else suggests otherwise,” said Mr. Dufour, who is a marquis and whose full title is Dufour Berte Landucci.

From Liguria to Sicily it was a bad year, compared by many to the harsh winter of 1985, which froze many thousands of trees and took years to recover from.

This year, again, the weather was to blame, with a hot spring, followed by a tempestuous rainy summer — which encouraged the proliferation of the fruit fly — and a hot, humid fall.

“I don’t think this is going away, because those miserable bugs are out there,” said Nancy Harmon Jenkins, whose book on olive oil, “Virgin Territory,” will be published in February.

“Maybe that’s what we’re facing in the future,” she added. “More warm winters and wet summers, which is the opposite of Mediterranean and not what olive trees are used to withstand.”

Farmers throughout Italy are crossing their fingers that the temperatures will drop below freezing this winter, killing the flies, but until now warm temperatures have prevailed. If that continues, more aggressive steps must be taken to combat the blight.

“It shouldn’t even cost much,” said Niccolò Taiti, the head of Calenzano’s tourist bureau. “But it has to be done, otherwise trouble is assured.”","Amid Bugs, Hail, Floods and Bacteria, Italian Olives Take a Beating",2014-12-04,The olive fruit fly and various weather problems helped make 2014 Italian olive oil&#8217;s annus horribilis.,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/world/europe/amid-bugs-hail-floods-and-bacteria-italian-olives-take-a-beating.html

822,"“Economically, socially and politically, the country will have to go through severe economic tests in the years to come,” said Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “Not having a working, realistic, credible model for economic development, not just muddling through, will become critical.”

Mr. Putin acknowledged that many Russians blamed Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the central bank, for the crisis, but he defended the record of the bank.

“I believe that the central bank and the government are taking adequate measures,” he said. He did not present any new policies or a specific plan to address the problems, but rejected predictions that currency controls were in the offing.

He also said Russia should try not to waste its $419 billion in currency reserves. The central bank has spent about $75 billion this year defending the ruble.

Mr. Putin described the problems as rooted in external factors, including the drop of about 50 percent in oil prices this year and Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s incursion into Ukraine. He said that global demand for oil would recover next year or in two years, and that this would solve the problem.

The president, sitting on a small stage in an amphitheater in a Moscow hotel, seemed to be relying on his high popularity to carry the day, noting that Russia had emerged from the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed under his leadership. But it remained an open question whether that would be enough to persuade Russians, who are facing a sharp recession next year.

“Above all, the goal was to calm people down about the crisis,” Mikhail Vinogradov, head of the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation, said by telephone shortly after the speech. “The question is whether Putin’s calming words will turn into any kind of action.”

Ordinary Russians are worried about the ruble’s collapse and rising inflation, which is expected to climb 10 percent by the end of the year and even higher early next year. They have flooded car dealerships, appliance stores and malls to spend savings before their rubles lose any more value.

The popular discount Swedish furniture chain Ikea has been mobbed for the last week. On Thursday, the company announced that it was suspending all sales of kitchen furniture and appliances for two days to catch up with the orders. It also announced that it would raise prices — a common step by importers trying to keep up with the lower value of the ruble. Russia depends on imports for about 30 percent of its consumer goods.

Mr. Putin accused the West of trying to build a virtual wall around Russia by moving NATO forces closer to its border, and noted that the $50 billion that Russia plans to spend on its military next year is much less than the Pentagon’s budget.

He also conceded that Russia had contributed to a recent rise in global tensions by resuming long-range military surveillance flights across Europe and along the edges of North America. “The only thing we have done is to protect our interests in a tougher way,” he said.

That theme plays well at home, where political analysts estimate as much as 40 percent of the population wants Russia to regain its superpower status.

Mr. Putin slipped in some criticism of the C.I.A. torture report in response to a question about the legality of burning the homes of suspected terrorists in Chechnya. “After 9/11, torture was legalized. How could you explain that?” he asked, a reference to the waterboarding of terror suspects by the C.I.A. during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Mr. Putin estimated that 25 to 30 percent of the economic distress was rooted in the sanctions over Ukraine, but conceded that Russia had not done enough to diversify an economy in which energy resources constitute 60 percent of the country’s exports.

Even while Mr. Putin was speaking, the European Union imposed an array of new sanctions involving investment, services and trade linked to Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Russian corporations owe approximately $650 billion to Western banks, but sanctions have eliminated any chance of refinancing that debt. The foreign reserves should cover that for the time being, Mr. Putin suggested, though some analysts say as much as half of that — around $200 billion — is tied up in other obligations, like pensions.

Mr. Putin stressed that Russia wanted to solve the crisis in Ukraine, and said he thought that President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine did, too, but that some nationalists there did not.

In response to a question from a Ukrainian reporter about how many Russian soldiers had been dispatched into eastern Ukraine and how many had died there, Mr. Putin again called Russian fighters volunteers. He did not say how many had died. Still, Russia has toned down its rhetoric on Ukraine in the last month.

The news conference is an annual ritual, with Mr. Putin picking questions at random from 1,200 or so reporters ranging from the mainstream Russian press to the BBC.

In one awkward moment, a Russian reporter suggested in slurred speech that Mr. Putin support the sale of kvass, a mildly alcoholic beverage, in international chain stores. Mr. Putin suggested that the man might have been sipping a little. The Russian media soon reported that the reporter was not drunk, but that his speech had been slurred by two strokes.

Several journalists asked why the state media had been unleashed to attack government critics as fifth columnists, to which Mr. Putin said it was sometimes hard to tell where “the opposition ends and the fifth column starts.” A fifth column is a group that tries to undermine a larger group.

One reporter asked about Mr. Putin’s personal life. The president answered by saying that recently a European dignitary had asked him whether he had any love in his life.

Mr. Putin said he had assured the unidentified visitor that he did, that he saw his former wife periodically as well as his two grown daughters. “Everything is fine,” he said.","Putin, Acknowledging Financial Turmoil, Assures the Nation It&#8217;s Temporary ",2014-12-19,"Russia&#8217;s president acknowledged that country is &#8220;going through a trying period, difficult times at the moment,&#8221; but said it was not a crisis.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/world/europe/vladimir-putin-annual-press-conference.html

855,"Ms. Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate, had been mostly quiet about the ballot measure, but she came out late last week with a blazing attack in favor of repealing the Parnell plan. In an online column and a video at her new subscription-based website, she railed against the “outside influence” that she said had infiltrated state politics.

“For years outside Big Oil tried to tell us, ‘Hush now, little Alaskans, just trust us to do right by you,’ ” Ms. Palin wrote on her Facebook page, which has 4.3 million “likes,” about six times the population of Alaska. “We won’t be suckered again by multimillion-dollar P.R. campaigns and crony capitalists wanting us to fall for scaremongering.”

Ms. Palin’s broadside accentuated and compounded what had already been a collection of strange bedfellows, aligning her with some of the most liberal Democrats in the Legislature and a smaller group of Republicans who support Ballot Measure 1, an effort to reverse the legislation championed by Mr. Parnell, who was Ms. Palin’s lieutenant governor and succeeded her when she resigned in 2009.

Supporters of the Parnell plan, led by the oil companies — who have outspent the supporters of the old Palin plan by about 10 to 1 — said the ACES law had been aimed at punishing the industry after a bribery scandal. They also said that it made for bad economics, with a progressive tax structure that increased and decreased revenue collection based on the price of oil and the producer’s level of investment. They credit the new system for a turnaround, with declines in oil production flattening out since the law took effect on Jan. 1.

“I don’t want to back to the good old days; they weren’t that good,” said State Senator Cathy Giessel, a Republican and leader of the “Vote No on 1” movement. She said that a “philosophy of hatred” toward oil companies would backfire among Alaskans who understand that the industry had changed the state for the better.

Mr. Parnell said he had not responded directly to Ms. Palin’s comments and planned to argue “facts rather than slogans,” in defending his system. But he said the history was clear that the ACES system — which he once supported and helped push into law — had been a failure.

“We just cannot ignore the guaranteed decline that Alaska experienced under ACES,” he said. “I believe Alaskans deserve a more secure future.”

Supporters of the Palin plan (though few call it that, because Ms. Palin remains as polarizing a figure here in her home state as she is in the lower 48) said its regulations had teeth and pointed to the oil industry’s distaste for it as proof. Three of the biggest oil companies in business here — BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil — have together contributed more than $7.8 million this year to the “Vote No on 1” campaign.

“What’s at stake is whether Alaska is going back down the old path of being exploited by absentee owners, which is the history of Alaska since the Russians first came,” said Victor Fischer, a leader of the drive to restore ACES. Mr. Fischer is a 90-year-old former urban planner and World War II veteran who helped draft the State Constitution, which took effect when Alaska gained statehood in 1959. He said that he was not sure what Ms. Palin’s re-emergence could mean, but that even if it swung only a few votes among her Tea Party followers, it could be significant in a tight election.

Voters in Tuesday’s primary will also be selecting a Republican nominee to face United States Senator Mark Begich in November for the hotly contested Senate seat that could swing control of the chamber. All three contenders have expressed opposition to a return to the Palin law, while Mr. Begich has said he will stay out of the fight and let the voters decide. There have been no reliable and independent opinion polls on the tax issue, but both sides acknowledge that the results will probably be close and that turnout could be much higher than the 25 percent to 30 percent that is typical for an August primary.

The odd new wrinkles of the tax debate were evident on Thursday night in a heavily Democratic neighborhood in downtown Anchorage, where “Vote Yes” signs supporting repeal dotted many lawns, and where the idea of Ms. Palin as an ally was met with head-scratching by people like Brian Risinger, 35, a burly, bearded longshoreman.

“I don’t listen to anything she has to say,” said Mr. Risinger, who planned to vote in favor of reinstating the Palin-era system. “No one really cares what she does.”

Economists agree that the stakes in Tuesday’s vote are high, but that both sides are probably overselling their product.

“This is the big issue of our day,” said Gunnar Knapp, an economist and the director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska. “But it’s not like either choice can bring you nirvana.”",Oil Industry’s Taxes Create Odd Wedge for Alaskan Voters,2014-08-18,"Former Gov.

865,"UNITED NATIONS — In a show of unity by the world powers against the Islamic State, the United Nations Security Council is preparing to adopt a legally binding resolution intended to choke the terrorist group’s ability to trade in oil, antiquities and hostages.

The draft resolution, which was scheduled to be discussed by Council members in a closed meeting Friday afternoon, requires all 193 member states of the United Nations to prevent the sale of antiquities from Syria, similar to a measure the Council passed 10 years ago regarding antiquities from Iraq.

It also calls for sanctions against those who help the banned terrorist organization produce and smuggle oil out of Syria, and reminds all countries around the world that it is already illegal to pay the group ransom in exchange for hostages. The draft resolution was obtained by The New York Times on Friday.

In a measure of rare consensus among world powers about the need to confront the Islamic State, the draft resolution was proposed by Russia and backed by the United States and other Western powers. The Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, said Friday afternoon that he expected it to be adopted next week.

Despite stubborn differences on what to do about the war in Syria, an American official said earlier in the day that American diplomats had “worked relatively constructively” with their Russian counterparts.

The draft resolution is under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, though it does not authorize the use of military force. Council resolutions already prohibit providing financial support of any kind to the Islamic State, as well as to a Qaeda affiliate operating in Syria known as the Nusra Front.

The draft measure cites the trade in oil, making it specifically illegal to buy oil produced or sold by those groups, or to supply equipment to help them run oil refineries, though the plummeting price of oil is believed to have reduced how much the group earns from doing so.

The draft also refers to a previous resolution that prohibits the payment of ransom to banned terrorist organizations, though it does not specifically address the issue of prisoner exchanges. A United Nations panel late last year estimated that the Islamic State received more than $35 million in ransom payments over the past year, though it could not quantify how much it made from the sale of antiquities, directly or from taxing dealers who operated in its territory.

The draft resolution does not add any new names to the list of individuals who face sanctions already, though it asks a United Nations sanctions committee to “immediately consider designations of individuals and entities engaged in oil trade-related activities.”",U.N.

870,"On Sept. 8 in the Chukchi Sea, Shell achieved a milestone. The Discoverer attached a web of anchors to the seabed. The drill began to spin. Barely 24 hours later, the Arctic wind pushed an ice floe 30 miles long and 10 miles wide right at the ship, and it was forced to retreat. It didn’t matter. A grainy video appeared that same day on Shell’s official YouTube page. “Shell readies the drill bit for first spud!” the caption read. (To spud is to begin drilling.) “This marks the culmination of more than six years of effort by Shell. . . . This is the first time a drill bit has touched the sea floor in the U.S. Chukchi Sea in more than two decades.” On Oct. 3 in the Beaufort Sea, which had been off limits for weeks during the local bowhead-whale hunt, the Kulluk performed much the same operation. Shell made the most of having only partly drilled just two of its five planned wells.

Then it was time to leave. By late October on the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, it was dark more than 16 hours a day. The Arctic produced its standard mix of clouds, fog, wind and snow. Sea ice was already creeping back after its annual low point the previous month. Patches of it blotting out stretches of open water. This is when ships must either leave the Arctic or risk getting stuck fast in the ice.

The Discoverer departed the Chukchi for Dutch Harbor on Oct. 28. The voyage was uneventful, but two weeks later, in port, its revamped exhaust system emitted a loud blast that port officials felt hundreds of yards away. They called 911. The ship’s crew extinguished a small blaze minutes before the police and fire departments arrived. In an email to the local radio station, a Shell spokesman denied that the explosion had been anything other than “a common backfire.”

Ten days after that, near Seward, Alaska, the Discoverer’s propeller shaft began vibrating so badly that the crew shut down its engines and had it towed to port. Coast Guard safety inspectors boarded for a routine visit and found 16 violations, many of them serious. “As a result of backfires,” they wrote, “main propulsion machinery and all auxiliary machinery essential to the propulsion and safety of the unit may be compromised.” They temporarily impounded the ship so that it couldn’t leave port and called in a Coast Guard criminal unit from outside Alaska. Noble Drilling, Shell’s subcontractor, rushed to provide lawyers for the crew. When the criminal team arrived, the crew refused to talk. The case was passed on to the Justice Department. Eventually, with the help of a confidential informant, investigators would learn of the ship’s multiple unreported engine failures and makeshift hose-and-barrel system for bilge water that discharged oily waste into the ocean. (Two years later, on Dec. 19, 2014, Noble Drilling pleaded guilty to eight felony charges and agreed to $12.2 million in fines and in community-service payments.)

While the Discoverer was making its way south from the Chukchi, the Kulluk was still sitting in the Beaufort Sea. It couldn’t leave until it discharged most of its 83-person drilling crew. To shuttle workers to and from the Beaufort shore, Shell had hired PHI, a helicopter company that it had long used in the Gulf of Mexico. As the weather worsened, the helicopters were often unable to make the trip. They had no de-icing equipment, and their pilots were unfamiliar with the Arctic. Adding to the delays, rough seas made it difficult to refuel the Kulluk’s tugboat, the Aiviq. The rig remained at 70 degrees north well into November. Snowdrifts piled up on its deck, and ice the consistency of a Slurpee formed in the water around it.

As Shell prepared the rig for the return voyage to Dutch Harbor and potentially on to Seattle, it again tried to hire MatthewsDaniel, the marine warranty-survey company that it had asked to independently examine and approve its June 2012 tow north. This time the company was unavailable, Shell told investigators. But according to a 152-page report on the grounding of the Kulluk that the Coast Guard released in April 2014, MatthewsDaniel was concerned that the second leg of the voyage might prove too dangerous. In an email, MatthewsDaniel told Shell that it “would not approve a tow of the Kulluk from Dutch Harbor to Seattle during the month of November as weather data shows that seas can reach as much as 10 meters in the Gulf of Alaska.”

Shell hired a different warranty surveyor, GL Noble Denton (not affiliated with Noble Drilling), that agreed to approve both legs of the trip. When the Kulluk arrived back at Dutch Harbor, it was almost Thanksgiving.

By December, the Gulf of Alaska is one of the stormiest places anywhere. According to the National Weather Service, gale-force winds are present 15 percent of the time during December and January; 20 percent of the time, the sea swells top 17 feet; and in an average year, hurricane-force winds hit two or three times. The sensible approach would have been to wait out the winter in Dutch Harbor, safe in the Aleutians, on the edge of the gulf. The Kulluk had a customized berth in Dutch Harbor — rounded to match its hull — and would be better positioned to go back up to the Arctic the following summer and complete the new wells. But the company wanted to make off-season upgrades to the Kulluk that would be either impossible or too expensive in Dutch Harbor. And there was another consideration: If the Kulluk was in an Alaskan port on New Year’s Day, executives believed, it would be subject to a state oil-facilities tax of as much as $6 million. In late December, a spokesman confirmed Shell’s fears in an email to a longtime reporter at a local newspaper, The Dutch Harbor Fisherman, writing, “It’s fair to say the current tax structure related to vessels of this type influenced the timing of our departure.” (“That was an unfortunate article,” Pete Slaiby, the Alaska vice president for Shell, told a crowd in Kodiak in early January, reiterating the need for “very specific things” it needed done on the mainland.)

The Aiviq also had problems. Towing the Kulluk over the summer, the tug had run into a storm that sent saltwater flooding over its back deck and into the fuel vents and interior spaces, damaging cranes, electronics and heating systems. In a separate incident on the November return from the Beaufort Sea, the tug had an electrical blackout, and one of its main diesel engines overheated, rendering it unusable until it was repaired in Dutch Harbor. By law, according to the Coast Guard report, such system failures should have been reported to the Coast Guard. They were not. The Aiviq’s captain sent an email to Chouest headquarters titled “Storm Damage Lessons Learned” and recommended that they raise the height of its fuel vents to avoid future submersion during the next big tow through heavy Alaskan seas, but this was never done.

On the morning of Dec. 21, as the Aiviq and Kulluk crews prepared to depart on the three-week journey back to Seattle, Shell’s new warranty surveyor took careful note of the certificates for the steel shackles that would connect the two vessels and bear the dead weight of the giant Kulluk — without noticing that they had been replaced with theoretically sturdier shackles of unknown origin. He examined the shackles but had little means by which to test their strength. He did not ask the crew to rotate the shackles, as one might rotate tires on a car. He did not consider it part of his job, he would tell Coast Guard investigators, to examine whether Shell’s overall plan to cross the Gulf of Alaska made any sense.

The Aiviq pulled the Kulluk away just after lunchtime. The Aiviq’s usual captain was on vacation for the holidays, as were Slaiby and other members of Shell’s senior Alaska staff. The rest of the tug’s crew had limited experience in the operation of the new, complex vessel. Onboard the Kulluk was a skeleton crew of 18 men, along for the ride in large part because of an inconvenience of the rig’s flag of convenience. The Kulluk was registered in the Marshall Islands, the same country where BP’s contractors had registered the Deepwater Horizon, and the Marshall Islands required that the rig be manned, even when under tow. The new captain of the Aiviq, Jon Skoglund, proposed aiming straight for the Seattle area, a direct and faster “great circle” route that would leave the two ships alone in the middle of the North Pacific but would avoid the shoals, rocks and waves of the Alaskan coast. There would be no shore to crash into. They could lengthen the towline for better shock absorption and would have room to move if problems arose. The idea was dropped because the Kulluk’s 18 crew members would then be out of range of Coast Guard search-and-rescue helicopters. Perversely, a flag of convenience, seen as a way to avoid government regulation, had Shell seeking a government safety net — and a longer, more dangerous, near-shore route.

Skoglund was so concerned as he began his first Gulf of Alaska tow that he sent an email to the chief Kulluk mariner on the other side of the towline. “To be blunt,” he wrote, “I believe that this length of tow, at this time of year, in this location, with our current routing guarantees an ass kicking.”

The Kulluk’s crew celebrated Christmas Day three days later with a lonely barbecue on the deck of the rig. As forecast, the weather was turning. By midnight there were gale-force winds and swells the size of houses. Rather than crash forward through the building swells, as other ships might, the Kulluk marked their passage like a giant metronome, pitching and rolling a stomach-churning five, then seven, then 10 degrees off vertical. Six hundred yards ahead, the same waves were bucking the Aiviq, but the two ships were out of sync. The towline between them was slack one moment, then crackling with tension, then slack again.

The Coast Guard report describes the harrowing series of events that followed. At daybreak on Dec. 27, still two weeks out of Seattle, the Edison Chouest employee managing the towline on the Aiviq side, Third Mate Bobby Newill, shot a cellphone video for his wife as he gradually let out a hundred yards more line, trying to find a sweet spot. The ship’s tow system was built by Rolls-Royce: a winch on the back deck and computerized controls up in the wheelhouse. Newill’s video shows the view through the wheelhouse window as the stern of the Aiviq bobs in the Gulf of Alaska, the Kulluk in the distance, then it pans to a computer monitor that displays towline tension. From 35 tons, the tension shoots rapidly into the triple digits — “Here we go,” Newill says — and peaks at 228 tons. “That is a good quality piece of wire,” he says as the numbers drop again.

Between 5:34 a.m. and 11:29 a.m., according to a later computer analysis by Rolls-Royce, the Aiviq’s “wire tensile strength overload” alarm went off 38 times. It was set to trigger at 300 tons. The alarm, a piercing ring, would not stop until Newill acknowledged it on the computer screen. New to Alaska and new to a ship that was new to the world, Newill later claimed that the alarm never went off. Coast Guard investigators concluded that he mistook the tension alarm for another alarm that was known to be acting up.

At 11:35 a.m. the towline snapped. Video shot from the Aiviq’s closed-circuit cameras shows the moment. It is unremarkable: The taut line stretches into the sea. The tail of the tug rises once again, and the line suddenly whips back and goes limp. The Aiviq keeps bobbing. Aboard the Kulluk, the crew prepared an emergency towline. Retrieving and reconnecting with the original line was impossible, investigators would learn, because “the Kulluk cranes could only be used in ideal sea and wind conditions seldom found in the winter Gulf of Alaska conditions.” Instead, the Kulluk would now be towed from what was considered its stern, from a bracket beneath the helicopter deck, where an emergency line was already in place. Because the Kulluk was perfectly round, it was hard to imagine that the new orientation would make any difference.

To pick up the emergency towline from the Kulluk, the Aiviq made a U-turn, just as a water-ski boat might go back for a fallen skier. But it did so in swells that exceeded 25 feet. Briefly perpendicular to them, it took a heavy roll. A steel hook the size of a grand piano, secured to a wall when not in use, came crashing down, damaging handrails and vents. The engineer welded it to the floor to keep it from sliding; sailors chased down inflatable “anchor balls” now rolling loose around the ship. Seawater poured onto the deck and, once again — because no one had acted on the captain’s recommendation to move them higher before the Aiviq left Dutch Harbor — into the fuel vents.

Three hours after the Aiviq lost the Kulluk, the ships were connected again. To reduce stress on the emergency towline and shackles, the crew of the Aiviq reduced engine power, keeping tension to no more than 60 tons. They tried to put distance between the ships and a nearby area of shoals, where giant swells could crest or the Kulluk, with its 35-foot draft, could drag on the seabed. This, at the time, seemed the primary danger. The nearest land, Kodiak Island, was still 65 miles away. The wind backed off, but the seas remained heavy. By 4:30 p.m. it was dark.

In the early-morning hours of Dec. 28, the Aiviq’s four main diesel engines began to fail: No. 2, then No. 3 and No. 4 and, finally, No. 1. The apparent cause was saltwater intrusion. What remained were small, electric thrusters — not powerful enough to keep both vessels moving forward, but they could at least keep the Aiviq facing into swells and away from the Kulluk. The Aiviq’s course was now determined by the westerly current and southwesterly winds. In calls to the Coast Guard that day and the next, Skoglund, the Aiviq’s captain, would make reference to “some water in our fuel” and “some signs of water intrusion.” But in the aftermath of the Kulluk incident, the Aiviq’s engineer, Carl Broekhuis, theorized that saltwater intrusion wasn’t to blame after all. He suggested that an unknown fuel additive had ruined the Aiviq’s injectors, shutting down its main engines. Perhaps what happened was outside his or Edison Chouest’s or Shell’s control. But when the engine manufacturer later analyzed the spent injectors, it found rust and high levels of sodium, chlorine, calcium and potassium. “These elements,” notes the Coast Guard report, “are major components of seawater.”

Skoglund and his counterpart on the Kulluk, a Shell subcontractor known as the “tow master” — in the official tow plan for the journey to Seattle, Shell never made clear who between them was in charge — notified Shell and Chouest almost immediately after the troubles began. Shell notified the Coast Guard. Early on Dec. 28, just as the Aiviq’s four diesel engines failed, a Coast Guard cutter appeared. The cutter tried to connect to the Aiviq by an emergency towline — it would tow the tug, which would tow the Kulluk — but in heavy seas, the line somehow became wrapped around the cutter’s own propeller. The rescue ship limped back to base on Kodiak. The Aiviq and Kulluk remained adrift. The second of what would be four successive low-pressure systems approached.

In Anchorage, 350 miles to the north, Shell, Chouest and the Coast Guard established a formal structure to deal with the growing crisis. The unified command, as it was called, reporting ultimately to a Coast Guard captain. It took over a downtown Marriott and quickly grew to hundreds of people wearing vests and lanyards and huddling in conference rooms. They updated Lisa Murkowski, a United States senator from Alaska. They called in more tugboats, including the Alert, one of the most powerful in Alaska, which began chugging toward the scene from Prince William Sound, a day away.

By the early, dark hours of Dec. 29, the unified command was convinced that lives were at risk, and it dispatched two Coast Guard Jayhawk helicopters to evacuate the 18 increasingly anxious men stuck aboard the Kulluk.

The rescuers had thought it would be a relatively easy job. The Coast Guard air base on Kodiak Island, the northernmost such facility in the country, is an outpost at the edge of a wilderness of water and mountains. Its search-and-rescue area spans four million square miles. To have a case “so close to home plate,” as one of them put it — 45 flight minutes and roughly a hundred miles away — seemed a stroke of incredible luck. Further, the Kulluk’s size suggested stability, a straightforward rescue.

When it appeared out of the night, “the Kulluk was wicked lit up,” said Jason Bunch, the Coast Guard rescue swimmer on the first of two helicopters. “It was like a city.” The pilots illuminated the rig further with hover lights and spotlights. They wore night-vision goggles, just in case the lights weren’t enough. They had no problems seeing the rig and the crippled Aiviq and the taut line between them, but the surrounding darkness still eroded the pilots’ depth perception. With no horizon to reference, it was harder to hover, and the goggles took away their peripheral vision.

There are two primary ways Jayhawk crews save people at sea: They lower a basket to the deck of the stricken vessel and hoist them up, or they pluck them out of the water by lowering a basket and a swimmer like Bunch, a 12-year Kodiak veteran, who in 50-foot swells and 35-degree water will drag them to the basket himself.

But now that the Kulluk was being towed from its “stern,” the point of attachment for the emergency towline, it and the Aiviq were oriented exactly the wrong way for an approach. In order to maintain control, the helicopters would ideally face the heavy winds head-on, but the derrick blocked their path. If they tried to hover above the flight deck, the only obvious place for a hoist, there was a perfect tail wind, which made steering unpredictable and dangerous.

The wind blew the tops off some of the massive swells, but otherwise they weren’t breaking. The swells came in close sets, one right after another, interrupted by long sets of “monster waves” more than twice as high. The Kulluk tipped severely but somewhat rhythmically until the monsters arrived. “As the bigger and bigger ones came, they made it go around in a circle,” Bunch told me in Kodiak. His eyes went buggy. His right hand gyrated wildly. The deck, normally 70 feet above the water, “was dipping so deep that the water was surging on it.”

“You know when you have a bobber on a fishing pole,” he asked, “and then you throw it out there and reel in really fast, and it makes a wake over the bobber? That’s what it looked like.” If the Kulluk’s deck was pitching that badly, he said, you could imagine what the derrick was doing. It looked as if it were trying to bat the helicopters out of the sky.

The two helicopters took turns circling the drill rig, looking for a way in, for any place to lower the basket. They radioed back and forth with the Kulluk’s crew — “Very, very professional, very squared away,” Bunch said, “considering the environment” — and briefly wondered if there was a way to get them in the water to be picked up by the swimmers. It was impossible. The jump from the deck to the sea could kill a man if he timed it wrong. If it didn’t, the Kulluk could kill him on the next swing of the bat. They flew back to Kodiak, refueled, brainstormed some more at the base, then went back out.

Six hours had passed from the moment Bunch and his crew first flew over the Kulluk. It was still night. Bunch took out his watch and began timing the gaps between big sets of swells. “We started coming up with some harebrained schemes,” he said. They looked for “maybe doable” spots for the hoist. “We’d have 90 seconds to be in and out, which is just impossible, but we were actually talking about it.” Reality — what their commander called “the courage not to do it” — slowly set in. The two helicopters returned to base. “We were experienced,” Bunch said, “so eventually we were like, ‘This is stupid.' ”

It was just before dawn when a helicopter crew led by Lt. Cmdr. Jim Cooley replaced Bunch and the other fatigued rescuers from the night before. The Kulluk was still about 16 miles from Kodiak Island but also 16 miles from another island, Sitkinak, and being blown toward it.

The sun was coming up as Cooley, a blond distance runner with a broad smile, reached the rig. The seas had slightly calmed. The wind angle had slightly changed. “Hoisting was still in the dicey category,” he said. But it now seemed possible. They did a test run first, hovering without the basket. The deck of the Kulluk still rose and fell significantly with every swell. The derrick was still pitching, and one of its cables had come loose and was whipping around in the air. But if they hovered in just the right spot and paid attention to the swell, it seemed possible.

There was another problem: The smallest of the 18 men aboard the Kulluk weighed 235 pounds. The largest ones were well over 300. Cooley seems to feel guilty even remembering how big they were. But when you’re flying a rescue mission, you notice. “They were huge,” said his flight mechanic, James Smith. “They were all huge — huge guys. There’s no other way to describe it.” Weight is everything to a helicopter pilot. You want just the right amount of fuel. Too much fuel, and you’re too heavy to fly. Too little fuel, and you don’t make it back to base. The same goes for the people you save: You want to be able to pack as many into the aircraft as possible, so you don’t have to do multiple sorties. But you don’t want to pack in so many big people that you can’t maneuver.

If they added an extra flight to Kodiak and back, if they were fast, they might just be able to do it before darkness returned. Cooley and his rescue swimmer watched the coming waves and called out “large . . . medium . . . small.” Smith, in charge of lowering the basket, directed the other pilot, who was at the controls that morning: “Easy left. Easy back and right. Back and left 30 feet. 30. 20. 10. Hold.” Lowering the basket and more than a hundred feet of line from the helicopter to the pitching deck below was like a mad version of going after a stuffed toy in an arcade claw-machine game. “Then a flat sea came in, and we could crank out a hoist,” Cooley said.

One by one, the Kulluk’s crew were hauled up. Most were calm. But the rig rose up and gave the basket a bump just as one man was being lifted off the deck. “This guy’s a little nervous,” Smith said. “He’s got a death grip.” Cooley looked down and saw his face. “I’m seeing the reality,” he told me. “This guy is scared.” They pulled him into the helicopter and sat him on the floor. Four hours after the rescue crews arrived, they plucked the final man off the Kulluk and flew back to base.

The crew was safe, and now the Aiviq was coming back to life: Before and during the rescue, the helicopters had also hoisted 2,000 pounds of replacement parts to the crippled tug: injectors that had been flown to Alaska in a private jet, then transferred to the Jayhawks. All four main diesel engines on the Aiviq would eventually be restarted. With another low-pressure system on the way as the first engines fired up, the tug began trying to tow the Kulluk south into the open ocean.

The tugboat Alert arrived on the scene on Dec. 30, and one of the first communications that Craig Matthews, the Alert’s chief engineer, recalls hearing was more bad news. “Be advised,” a Southern drawl said over the radio. “We just parted our cable.” Communications — carried out over multiple radio channels and satellite phones between multiple ships and multiple federal and state agencies and Shell officials in Kodiak and Anchorage — had become so complex that they were now filtered through a Coast Guard C-130 flying somewhere in the clouds above. But the voice had come from the Aiviq. The emergency towline had snapped. The Kulluk was once again adrift, this time 30 miles from land.

Compared to the Aiviq, the Alert was small — half the Aiviq’s horsepower, a third of its length — but next to every other tug in Alaska, it was big. It usually worked in Prince William Sound, escorting oil tankers from the terminus of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in Valdez past Bligh Reef, the site of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, the worst in Alaska history. The escorts were mandated after the spill. The Alert’s job was to prevent another disaster, and its crew took that to heart when sent to keep the Kulluk off the rocks.

“I really wanted to do this thing,” said Matthews, who is 57 but looks at least a decade younger. “I really did.” He settled on a plan: His captain would back the Alert carefully up to the Kulluk, which was still lurching wildly in 30-foot swells. Matthews would go out on the deck with a grappling hook. When they got close enough to the rig’s snapped emergency towline, he would throw the hook. He would reel it in by hand. Then he would get the Alert’s own tow cable and tie the two together with the knot he suggested: a bowline.

The crew of the Alert stared at the Kulluk from a distance, through binoculars, in low light and tossing seas. It was drifting near Albatross Bank, “a wonderful halibut spot,” Matthews said. He used to fish it. It was wonderful but shallow, and now the waves were so big that the Alert was looking down on the giant rig one moment and looking up the next. They worried that if they got too close, the Kulluk, half the weight of the Titanic, would crash on top of them.

The captain backed in until they were barely 200 feet from the heaving Kulluk. Matthews spotted the orange emergency line. He threw the grappling hook. He missed. The captain backed in closer. Now the Kulluk filled the sky, and Matthews threw again and hooked the towline. It was thicker than a man’s arm, a soggy dead weight. “By the time I pulled it out of the water,” he said, “I was so winded I didn’t know whether I could tie a knot.”

He and the tug’s chief mate laid the orange line on the deck next to the yellow one from their tug. A third man stood on it so it wouldn’t slip back into the water. Now Matthews tried to orient himself. A knot he could normally tie with one hand without looking would have to be tackled by two people, chunk by chunk. The chief mate helped him lift the line again, and together they hurriedly bent it and forced the rabbit through the hole. As the tugboat bucked in the passing swells, they dragged and pulled the rope tight. Matthews had planned to do a second bend, just in case, but he was exhausted. “Is that it?” Matthews recalls the chief mate asking. His answer was to let the towline slide over the edge. They let out more line from their winch, slowly putting tension on it as the tug pulled away from the Kulluk. “Please hold, please hold,” he whispered. The line went tight. Everyone onboard started hooting.

For the next four hours, the Alert made halting progress against heavy winds and strong currents. Just before dawn, the Aiviq appeared on the horizon: Its crew wanted a last shot at the Kulluk.

“We’re gonna come around the Kulluk’s stern and grapple that other wire,” Matthews recalls the drawl announcing over the radio. “Don’t worry. We do this all the time. You won’t feel a thing.” The Aiviq snagged the 2,000-foot wire still trailing the rig. Soon a violent shudder was felt across the Alert — but Matthews’s knot still held. Now the Aiviq and Alert were towing the Kulluk side by side, one to starboard and one to port, a few hundred yards of churning Pacific Ocean between them. Despite the building storm, everything seemed to be under control. Matthews had been awake all night. He descended to his stateroom.

He doesn’t remember how long he slept, just what woke him up. Matthews keeps his space organized, his stateroom tied down. But suddenly pens and water bottles were loose and sliding across the floor. His corkboard dislodged from a wall and crashed to the ground. An alarm sounded. He rushed up to the wheelhouse.

They were stuck “in irons”: The stronger, younger Aiviq had moved away from the Alert in the storm. No longer were they towing in parallel — and the Alert couldn’t do anything about it. It was now at 9 o’clock to the Aiviq’s 12 o’clock, almost perpendicular to the wind and unable to turn upwind and catch up to the larger tug because the Alert’s towline to the Kulluk was too taut. The Alert was locked in place, slamming sideways into the troughs of the waves. “The waves were just beating us,” Matthews said. “Our entire deck was exposed.”

The line was riding so tight over the edge of the stern that there was a danger the Alert would flip if the right swell came along. Its captain made an urgent call to the Aiviq. The larger tug maneuvered closer to the Alert, which increased its speed. The two ships were just coming back together, straining against the storm, when the Aiviq’s cable snapped for the third and final time.

The Alert slid right into place ahead of the Kulluk, suddenly out of irons and facing the waves and winds head on. “It was immediately so much better,” Matthews said. “The only problem was that we were now the sole tow.” Sitkalidak, a barrier island off Kodiak Island, was little more than 10 miles downwind. From that moment on, the wind would push the Kulluk inevitably toward the island, dragging the Alert along behind it.

Now more was at stake than the Kulluk or the prospects of the company that owned it. The men on the Alert had to save themselves. “Winds to 50 knots,” Matthews recalled. “Seas 35 feet. We were going backward” — pulled by the Kulluk — “at 2 knots.” They pondered the endgame. With their spotlight, they watched the tow wire pull out of the water and vibrate under the tension. They worried that it would break and snap back. At first, Matthews wanted to remain tethered to the Kulluk and take it into the beach at Sitkalidak Island. The tug could stay just offshore, he reasoned, away from any breakers; when the storm went down and the tide went up, it could pull the rig back off the beach.

The captain called the Coast Guard, but no one wanted to go scout the landing conditions, Matthews said. It was too risky. The call came from Shell at 8 p.m. on New Year’s Eve: Cut it loose.

Matthews didn’t want to do it. “I felt this attachment to succeeding,” he said. He wondered about the emotion. “We’re trying keep this chunk of metal off a beach, where a chunk of metal shouldn’t be. But otherwise it’s just a chunk of metal that belongs to a rich oil company. It’s bottom line to them. Why does it matter to me? Is this important?” But somehow it was. “I felt tears welling up in my eyes when I had to let go of the Kulluk.”

The shore was only a few miles away, and now Matthews had to figure out how to untie his knot. His bosses called and suggested that he cut the thick cable with an acetylene torch tied to a broomstick. When he peered out the back window at the tow winch, three feet of water was surging over the tug’s weather deck. He put on foul-weather gear and tried to time the waves. The first one came over his chest and filled his boots and pants. But he got an idea: If he let the winch unspool all the way, all that would connect the Alert and the Kulluk would be a metal plate and two bolts. They wouldn’t hold.

The control room filled with smoke and bits of rust as Matthews let the winch spin.

“Is it gone yet?” the captain asked. Matthews had three wraps left. He was trying not to rats-nest the cable.

“Is it gone yet?” the captain asked again. “Is it gone? Let it go!”

There was a loud boom and a shower of sparks. It was gone. Matthews turned to see why the captain was so anxious. He found himself staring at a wall of water — a 50-foot wave, the biggest they had seen. The Alert went straight up its face. “There was this feeling of up and up and up and up and up and up,” he said. He put his hands against the back window to stabilize himself. White water was running over the front window. They couldn’t see anything. “When is this going to stop?” the captain asked.

At the top of the monster wave, they could suddenly see for miles. “This incredible moon was out,” Matthews said. “There was this oceanscape. These mountains of water. Storm clouds. It was a thing of awesome beauty.” It lasted for only a second or two. Then the Alert tipped down the other side, and the whole tug shuddered as it dived into the trough. The window filled with the view below the waterline, a Pacific green. It looked like an aquarium.

He watched the Kulluk on the radar. It started out slow, but let loose from its tether, it accelerated. It hit the gravelly shore 45 minutes later. Waves crashed over its hull, the wind kicked up a spray and the shoreline was soon littered with the Kulluk’s lifeboats and life jackets and hundreds of little silver packets of drinking water meant for men lost at sea. There was no spill. In the early hours of New Year’s Day, the Coast Guard flew over the wreck. In aerial photos published around the world, the rig was dwarfed by the auburn, grass-covered hills of the uninhabited island where it had finally come to a rest.

Eight weeks later, Shell announced a “pause” in its Arctic exploration. It wanted to “prepare equipment and plans for a resumption of activity at a later stage.” The company declared the rig a total loss and hauled it atop a larger ship by way of Singapore to China, where it was dismantled in a shipyard south of Shanghai.

Shell accepted the resignation of the executive in Houston overseeing exploration in Alaska and the rest of North America, a 29-year veteran of the company. It became the subject of multiple reviews and investigations by the Coast Guard, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. One investigation resulted in felony charges for Noble, one of the subcontractors. And instead of adding to its reserves, it was burning through them. In early 2014, Shell issued a surprise profit warning, the first since the reserves scandal a decade earlier.

Little about the increasingly extreme hunt for energy had changed. Shell still needed oil. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas had oil. Shell still had its leases, and in August, and as oil hovered around $100 a barrel, the company announced its intention to return to the Arctic. Its new exploration plan called for placing two rigs in the Chukchi, to maximize the exploration time between the ice’s retreat and its return. One rig was a replacement for the Kulluk: equally massive and also lacking propulsion, but not round. It would have to be towed. The other was the Noble Discoverer, which had been refurbished yet again — deemed unable to leave Alaska on its own power in 2013, it had been hauled to South Korea on a larger ship — and was now 49 years old. The company also announced that it would improve safety measures and more closely manage its contractors. “All to say we’ve taken a critical look at the experiences we’ve had in Alaska over the last several years,” Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, told The Times in August, “and this exploration plan takes those learnings into account.”

Pete Slaiby, still on the job in Alaska even after his boss in Houston was replaced, set out to fix a new problem: If oil production doesn’t soon begin on Shell’s Arctic leases, they will expire, the first ones in 2017. Slaiby petitioned for an unprecedented five-year extension in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, laying out the logic in a 10-page letter to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. “Despite Shell’s best efforts and demonstrated diligence,” he wrote, “circumstances beyond Shell’s control have prevented, and are continuing to prevent, Shell from completing even the first exploration well in either area.”

The oil giant lurched forward, seeming to regain power with every step: a joint venture in July with Inupiat villages, a September meeting about the Arctic at the White House, progress in November in a legal fight over drilling the Chukchi. The future looked promising but for one thing. In September, almost as soon as Shell had submitted its exploration plan, oil began a free fall. The price dropped from $90 a barrel that month to $80 in October and to $70 in November — the point at which unconventional oil tends to become uneconomical. Last month, the price went as low as $55 a barrel, the lowest in five years.

880,"While even Ms. Rousseff’s political opponents say that the possibility of her being impeached or resigning remains distant, she is grappling with political and economic crises that are feeding off one another and eroding her authority.

In addition to the street protests this month, prominent figures in her own Workers Party have begun criticizing her reluctant embrace of austerity measures sought by her critics in the business establishment.

At the same time, centrist leaders in her coalition in Congress are in open revolt against Ms. Rousseff, blaming her for not shielding them from inquiries over their involvement in the Petrobras scandal, raising doubts about whether she can push through unpopular spending cuts.

As Ms. Rousseff, 67, grows isolated from her own base of support, Brazil’s currency, the real, has undergone a sharp devaluation, falling more than 30 percent against the dollar since she won the first round of presidential elections in October. Meanwhile, concerns are growing over the problems at Petrobras, which ranks among the world’s most indebted companies.

The scandal dwarfs previous corruption cases in Brazil, with the Supreme Court authorizing the investigations of dozens of prominent political figures, including the heads of both houses of Congress. Former Petrobras executives who reached plea deals have described a scheme in which construction companies vying for business with the oil company paid bribes equivalent to about 3 percent of the value of contracts.

Recipients of the bribes pocketed vast sums; one manager, Pedro Barusco, has agreed to return nearly $100 million he hid in offshore accounts. The executives also said they channeled portions of the bribes to the Workers Party, some of which were used in Ms. Rousseff’s 2010 campaign, and to other parties and leaders in her coalition.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The scheme was put into motion during a period roughly corresponding to the time when Ms. Rousseff was chairwoman of Petrobras, from 2003 to 2010. At the time, she also served as energy minister and chief of staff to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, her predecessor.

No testimony has surfaced indicating that Ms. Rousseff personally profited from the bribery scheme, and she has insisted that she knew nothing about it until investigators revealed it last year.

Ms. Rousseff was a forceful presence at Petrobras, a sprawling enterprise founded in 1953, using her influence to expand the role of state-controlled companies and banks in Brazil’s economy.

With new legislation, she put Petrobras firmly in control of new deep-sea fields and gave it a nationalist mandate to buy ships, oil platforms and other equipment from struggling Brazilian companies, causing project delays and cost overruns.

These strategies were a shift from the 1990s, when Brazil’s government ended Petrobras’s monopoly, exposing the company to market forces while keeping it under state control.

The push to build entire domestic industries supplying Petrobras, as well as huge refineries in states controlled by allies of the Workers Party, created thousands of jobs — until now. The scandal and the worldwide slump in oil prices have caused Petrobras to suspend work on projects like a huge refinery complex in Itaboraí, a city near Rio de Janeiro.

The work force at the refinery has dwindled to less than 5,000 from a peak of 35,500 in 2013, according to union officials. Many laborers have returned to their home states in Brazil’s relatively poor northeast, but as many as 200 unemployed workers now live on the streets of Itaboraí, according to Fábio Krespane, coordinator of the city’s agency for the homeless.

Others are squatting in apartment complexes built during the boom years. One of the squatters, Leirson Fabiano Santos, 34, an unemployed heavy machinery supervisor, estimated that 90 percent of the workers had voted for Ms. Rousseff, but added, “I no longer have any good things to say about her.”

“Now she wants to raise taxes and energy prices so that we, the masses, pay the price for the corruption at Petrobras,” Mr. Santos said.

Ms. Rousseff had kept electricity prices low in recent years to keep inflation from accelerating, before allowing them to rise after she narrowly won re-election in October. Subsidized gasoline prices also wreaked havoc on Brazil’s once-envied ethanol industry by making biofuels costlier, with more than 60,000 jobs lost from 2013 to 2014 from sugar mill closings, according to Unica, a sugar and ethanol trade group.

“There was this sense that oil would allow Brazil to solve all sorts of problems,” said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “Instead, the biofuels industry was gutted, undermining a source of pride for Brazil around the world.”

Eyeing the achievements of Norway and Canada, oil-rich countries with enviable living standards, Brazil took steps to prepare for lean times, like putting a portion of oil revenues in a sovereign wealth fund created in 2008. But the idea was short-lived: Ms. Rousseff’s government raided the fund in 2012 to meet budget targets, leaving it with just a fraction of its holdings.

Still, energy experts point out that Brazil has strengths lacking in many other oil-rich countries such as Venezuela, including trusted institutions such as the Federal Police, which revealed the scandal to the nation, and the Supreme Court, which authorized investigations of an array of influential legislators. And a diverse economy, including a cutting-edge agricultural sector and a broad industrial base, reduces the reliance on oil. Petrobras also has technical expertise when it comes to finding and producing oil in complex offshore fields.

“Despite all the government meddling and the culture of corruption at the top of the company, Petrobras is still doing quite well on an operating level,” said Cleveland Jones, a geologist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.

Even so, the oil scandal contributing to Brazil’s economic quagmire is fueling a broader re-evaluation of the policies that strengthened the role of state-controlled enterprises under Ms. Rousseff. Even her finance minister, Joaquim Levy, is questioning the wisdom of giving so much power to corruption-plagued companies like Petrobras.

“State capitalism doesn’t work very well in a democracy,” Mr. Levy said in a speech to business leaders in São Paulo this week.",Brazil’s Slumping Economy and Bribery Scandal Eat Away at Dilma Rousseff’s Popularity,2015-03-21,"President Rousseff is fighting for her political survival, as her approval rating falls and the national oil company she once oversaw reels from a corruption scandal.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/21/world/americas/brazils-slumping-economy-and-bribery-scandal-eat-away-at-dilma-rousseffs-popularity.html

• Hasbro Earnings

The toy industry will be paying keen attention to Hasbro’s earnings on Monday morning, after a recent management shake-up at Mattel drew more scrutiny to two giants that have struggled to keep up with changes in technology and consumer appetites. Unlike Mattel, whose earnings have been gloomy, Hasbro’s earnings per share have been roughly flat in recent years. Analysts will pay special attention to how much items like Hasbro’s Get Up and GoGo My Walkin’ Pup Pet and Transformers action figures lifted holiday sales. —Rachel Abrams

• Swiss Bank Results

The Swiss bank UBS will report its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday and Credit Suisse will report its results on Thursday. The big question on the minds of investors this week will be the potential impact on the banks’ bottom lines of the rise of the Swiss franc to the euro. Last month, Switzerland abandoned measures to hold down the value of the franc to the euro as concerns about Europe’s economy pushed the euro downward.

UBS and Credit Suisse have both said that they did not sustain trading losses as a result of the jump in the franc after the Swiss National Bank’s move in January, but the rise in the franc could potentially lower their profits. Both banks hold capital in a variety of currencies, like the dollar, but report results in francs.

In a research report last month, Barclays estimated that the move in the franc could reduce UBS’s results by as much as 14 percent and Credit Suisse’s results by as much as 15 percent. —Chad Bray

• Clash Over Music Royalties

Trial begins in federal court in New York on Tuesday in a case pitting Pandora Media, the Internet radio giant, against the music licensing agency BMI, the latest clash over the value of music online.

Pandora wants its royalty rate lowered to what terrestrial radio broadcasters pay, while BMI — a clearinghouse for millions of songs — wants Pandora’s rate raised, arguing that it makes more intensive use of music than any traditional radio station.

The case comes as Pandora has been pummeled by Wall Street over lower-than-expected revenues, and also as legal and regulatory issues in the music industry are under scrutiny. Last week the United States Copyright Office recommended a series of changes in music copyright, and the Justice Department is currently considering changes in the decades-old regulatory agreements that govern BMI and its rival, Ascap. —Ben Sisario

• Chinese Inflation

China releases its consumer price index and producer price index for January on Tuesday morning in Beijing. Falling prices for oil and other commodities are expected to result in very low inflation at the consumer level, around 1 percent, and continued deflation at the producer level, with prices falling more than 3 percent from a year earlier.

But other monthly statistics normally issued in the second week of each month will not be coming out at all, including industrial production, retail sales, overall fixed asset investment and real estate investment.

The Lunar New Year holiday falls each year between late January and the middle of February — it is in the third week of February this year — and has a big effect on the economy because factories close for at least a week and often longer. So year-on-year comparisons of output in January or February are almost meaningless, and China waits until early March to release aggregate figures for January and February for numerous economic indicators. —Keith Bradsher

• Elis I.P.O

Elis, the French provider of rental uniforms, table and bed linens and carpets to businesses, is expected to begin trading on Euronext in Paris on Wednesday after pricing its initial public offering. The offering comes as European I.P.O.s are on pace for their best start since the financial crisis. Elis intends to sell 670 million euros, or about $763 million, in new shares in the I.P.O., while an entity controlled by the French buyout company Eurazeo and a group of Elis employees and managers plans to sell about €50 million of their holdings in the company.

Eurazeo acquired Elis from the French private equity firm PAI Partners in October 2007 in a deal that valued the company at about €2.28 billion. Eurazeo currently holds an 83 percent stake in Elis. Elis expects to price its I.P.O. at €13 to €16.50 a share. —ChadBray

• Tesla’s Numbers

The electric carmaker Tesla Motors will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday evening, and investors will be watching to see whether the company was able to achieve its goal of delivering 33,000 cars last year. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report monthly sales figures, only quarterly deliveries, and it needs around 11,000 more vehicles to make its target.

• Fashion Week Begins

The fall New York Fashion Week kicks off Wednesday, a perfume-infused nine days of designer shows from upstarts like Karolina Zmarlak and industry stalwarts like Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren. Among the events generating the most buzz is the expected introduction of a new line from Adidas and the hip-hop artist Kanye West, reflecting the strength of the “athleisure” fitness apparel boom in the United States. The twice-yearly fashion week, sponsored by Mercedes and run by the WME-IMG agency, is in the midst of an overhaul, and is set to move from Lincoln Center to downtown Manhattan later this year. —Hiroko Tabuchi

• January Retail Sales

On Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on retail sales in January. In December, retail sales fell as gas stations took in less money because of plunging energy prices, and because some holiday shopping had shifted to November. Economists expect the headline number to decline again for January, with gas prices continuing to drop and auto sales softer. Excluding those two often-volatile categories, economists expect retail sales to have increased by 0.4 percent in January, as consumers put the money they were saving on fuel to work elsewhere. In addition, frantic preparation for the blizzard that largely failed to materialize on the East Coast may have given retail activity a tiny boost last month. —Nelson D.

895,"Since Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula 10 months ago, more than $1 billion in real estate and other assets have been stripped from their former owners, according to estimates from the owners and lawyers. The assets include banks, hotels, shipyards, farms, gas stations, the major bakery, a vital dairy and even the storied lots of Yalta Film Studio, which 50 years ago made this now shabby seaside resort the Hollywood of the Soviet Union.

Property seizures on such a sweeping scale have not occurred since the Russian Revolution, owners said. Many have argued in court that the confiscations violate a clause in the Russian Constitution mandating compensation when the government takes property. But given the triumphant mood in Moscow about the annexation, the owners expressed little hope for redress.

“If you act like the Communists in 1917, and take everything away, you should just say it,” said Mr. Kuzmenko, speaking by telephone from Kiev. “If there is no compensation, it looks like robbery.”

Lawyers say the statutes governing property seizures are hazy and applied haphazardly, according to what suits the authorities.

“If they truly believe that Crimea is Russian territory, they should apply Russian law there and not some lower Crimean law that contradicts Russian law,” said Roman V. Marchenko, a lawyer based in Kiev whose firm, Ilyashev & Partners, is pursuing several cases.

But even if Russian law were applied, he said, that might not help. “We strongly believe that for political reasons we will not get justice in Russian courts.”

Lawyers say the government is selectively seizing property to cover its bills. “The Crimean authorities received a carte blanche to fund the budget of Crimea and they are looking for owners and stakeholders who are not in their party and not State Council deputies,” said Zhan Zapruta, the lawyer for Krymavtotrans, the peninsula’s main vendor of bus tickets, seized by the militia in September.

Crimea’s State Council, its parliament, opened the door for wholesale confiscations in August when it granted the government the right to take property to maintain “vital activity,” a concept so vague that lawyers suing the government say it is invoked to cover virtually anything. The law also states that the government will pay compensation.

Crimea’s government refuses to characterize its actions as confiscations, with top officials, including the prime minister, declaring them nationalizations.

“Nothing was confiscated,” said Vladimir A. Konstantinov, chairman of the State Council, when asked about the issue. “There is a procedure of forced redemption.”

By that, Mr. Konstantinov and other leaders mean that they are reclaiming property that they say was stolen from the government through illegal sweetheart deals made by Ukrainian officials and their oligarch cronies. The Crimean authorities have also seized assets from oligarchs they accused of financing the war against pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine. Business people living in Crimea and even Russians have lost property as well.

The main target to date is Igor Kolomoisky, a principal owner of PrivatBank, Ukraine’s largest bank, and currently the antiseparatist governor of Dnipropetrovsk. In late December, Crimea’s Ministry of Property and Land announced an auction of the 83 properties in which Mr. Kolomoisky owned shares. An earlier government list of his properties included hotels, office and apartment buildings, resorts and a chain of 16 gas stations.

The December announcement said money from the property sales would go to the Crimean budget and to depositors who lost their bank accounts when PrivatBank stopped operating in Crimea after the annexation. But a senior executive at the bank, Timur Novikov, said it was impossible to ascertain how the list of properties had been compiled, saying, “I think it is a total mess.”

In Kiev, the Ministry of Justice said that nearly 4,000 Ukrainian businesses or organizations had lost property. Mr. Konstantinov refused to discuss the precise number, and the Crimean Ministry of Property and Land declined to comment. But Mr. Konstantinov did say property owners would be reimbursed.

Russia’s Ministry of Crimean Affairs declined to comment. Several lawyers said their cases were referred to Russia’s Supreme Court, which is expected to issue the definitive ruling on whether the Crimean law is constitutional.

Various companies are turning to courts outside Russia. Many find their cases hobbled by the fact that the militia seized computers and legal documents along with the property, leaving the owners to fight back without records.

One of the most high-profile properties, Yalta Film Studio, sits high above the town, with sweeping views of the Black Sea.

In October, 12 armed men stormed the administration building and forced everyone there to lie face down, said Sergei M. Arshinov, the Moscow businessman who owns the property. He was perplexed because he had been negotiating with the government to sell the property back. He and his brother invested heavily in the 32-acre property and ran it for more than a decade as a back lot for movies and television shows.

The Crimean government cites the studio as an example of what it calls “criminal” land sales, saying publicly that it will pay only about $100,000 in compensation, reflecting what it says was the sale price under Ukrainian stewardship. Mr. Arshinov said he and his brother originally paid about $3 million for the property and then over $11,000 monthly in property taxes for the main parcel, which was valued at $13 million on the Ukrainian tax rolls. Mr. Arshinov said he and his brother had invested because a friend running Russia’s state movie committee asked them about 15 years ago to rescue the bankrupt studio.

Some longtime studio workers were ecstatic about the property seizure.

Valerie P. Pavlotos, 74, a former movie set builder, limped around an old seafront film lot, reliving the golden age of Soviet filmmaking.

“This entire area was always full of people in different costumes. You could see all the famous Soviet actors,” he said, adding repeatedly, “It was a cathedral of art.”

Two deserted sound stages and several small office buildings, with crumbling plaster, now sit abandoned behind an unmarked gate, just yards from a hectic boardwalk. Mr. Arshinov’s company sold off this smaller property in 2004.

Development plans were interrupted by gangland killings, Mr. Pavlotos said, adding scornfully, “For 23 years, Ukraine did nothing for this studio.”

In the fight over the spoils, ordinary Crimeans sometimes get caught in the middle.

The 41 Ukrainian banks operating in Crimea, for example, were forced to close. Some 30 Russian banks moved in, most of them small, provincial institutions.

All property belonging to PrivatBank was seized including branches, cash reserves and automated teller machines, said Mr. Novikov, the executive responsible for pursuing legal remedies. He estimated the bank’s overall losses at $1.1 billion.

Initially, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seemed to encourage Crimeans to stop repaying their loans. During a national presidential call-in show last spring, someone asked about a two-year car loan, saying, “PrivatBank no longer operates in Crimea. What am I supposed to do?”

Mr. Putin responded, “Please use the car and don’t worry.” Later, the Russian government urged loan repayments, but Mr. Novikov said that “as a result of public statements by Russian and Crimean officials, PrivatBank’s borrowers stopped paying their loans.”

The Crimean government maintains that all the assets seized equal the deposits retained by the bank when it ceased operations. The bank disputes the math.

“The amount of loans granted in the Crimea far exceeds the amount of funds accumulated through deposits,” Mr. Novikov said via email.

Crimean residents who lost deposits trek to the offices of Russia’s Deposit Insurance Agency. Many despair of retrieving any money.

In Simferopol, the capital, Kirill Attestatov, 28, a computer specialist, said his application always seemed to be missing something. “I don’t know when I will see the money,” he said. “Maybe next century.”

Yevgeniya Bavykina, Crimea’s deputy prime minister, wrote in response to an email query, that the fund had received 328,000 claims from depositors. Of the 34.6 billion rubles ($560 million) in claims, 29.8 billion ($482 million) had been verified, she wrote.

Crimea’s leaders repeatedly counsel patience while claiming that the transition is going well over all. But those finding themselves squeezed by the government are souring on Russian rule.

“If the state does not respect the right to private property, if that is dead, then I do not want to live in such a state,” said Mr. Zapruta, the lawyer for Krymavtotrans.","Seizing Assets in Crimea, From Shipyard to Film Studio",2015-01-11,"Since Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula 10 months ago, more than $1 billion in assets and real estate have been stripped from their owners and claimed by the Crimean government.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/world/seizing-assets-in-crimea-from-shipyard-to-film-studio.html

900,"“Our pricing is very transparent,” Sophie Kleinert, an Instacart spokeswoman, said in a statement. In many participating locations, she said, Instacart’s app offers the same price on items as the stores do.

In the case of Costco, she said, Instacart customers don’t have to pay a membership fee to order from the store chain — as Costco’s regular customers do — and the higher item prices can reflect the additional membership cost. She added that Instacart’s partnership with Costco also was not as “embedded” as it was with other partners.

My Costco purchase came to $181.59, including $4.60 for the cost of a month’s Costco membership. In the Instacart app, the total came to $231.80, including the marked-up items, delivery fee and tip. So the extra cost of using Instacart was $50.21, adding 27.7 percent to my tab.

Postmates, a service that summons a courier to buy and deliver different items from local merchants — from a birthday cake to a can of paint — can also be unpredictable with pricing. The company is more transparent than Instacart when breaking out costs up front. But its delivery fees vary depending on the distance between pickup and drop-off or availability of marketing promotions, among other factors. If consumer demand is high, fees rise accordingly, to entice more Postmates couriers to deliver during busier hours.

The fees can also change depending on the merchant. There is a lower delivery fee for merchants that are “in network,” or in formal partnerships with Postmates, which include Escape From New York Pizza and Green Chile Kitchen. The delivery fee is higher for “out of network” merchants, the company says

All of that explains why charges for my Postmates orders were all over the map. Ordering a $15 rock-climbing carabiner from a nearby sporting goods store resulted in a total cost of $33.45, including a $10.75 delivery fee, a 5 percent service fee, tax and a 20 percent tip — a markup over 120 percent.

A separate Postmates order of two pizzas was $54.79, including $36.34 for the pizzas, a $7.50 delivery fee, a 5 percent service fee and my addition of a 20 percent tip; that’s 50 percent more than a pickup order. A $48.77 prime rib (when I had a really bad day) amounted to $74.05 after fees and tip, another 50 percent markup.

Postmates is clearly a premium service, and the app doesn’t try to hide that. My nitpick of its system is that Postmates’ tipping tool also automatically calculates a percentage from the total cost, including the item subtotal, service fee (which covers Postmates’ operational costs and research and development) and delivery fee.

Who Delivers Where

That’s higher than if you ordered food the traditional way and tipped 20 percent based on the cost of the food. Why tip your Postmates courier for the company’s operational costs? Lesson learned: Take the time to calculate the tip manually when using Postmates instead of using its percentage calculator.

Another recent fast-delivery app is UberEats, an addition to the ride-hailing Uber app. I was shocked that within a minute of ordering a burrito from the app, the driver arrived outside my office building before I could ride down the elevator.

There’s an explanation for this kind of magic: UberEats offers a small selection of food items prepared by certain restaurants each day. In other words, my Uber driver was driving around town with a huge crate of the same burrito (which turned out to be unappetizing).

The pricing was straightforward. My total bill for the burrito was $10.88 — $10 for the burrito, and 88 cents for tax. The $10 price matched what the merchant charges for the burrito in its restaurant, meaning the cost for having it delivered was virtually nothing.

Sarah Maxwell, an Uber spokeswoman, said UberEats charged no delivery fee in San Francisco. But I would be wary of these low prices being temporary and food prices increasing to cover costs eventually.

For a fourth experiment, I ordered a bag of cat food and dog treats with Amazon’s new instant delivery service, Prime Now. For this service, the costs were clear: You have to be a Prime member, which costs $99 a year. If you want an order delivered within an hour, you pay an $8 fee; Amazon generally recommends a $5 tip. My $34.53 order of pet food added up to $51.24 after tax, tip and service were included; Prime Now fees added 48 percent to my cost.

One other factor to keep in mind with instant delivery apps: The couriers are humans prone to error. Brooke Hammerling, a tech start-up publicist based in New York, recently paid $113 to Postmates for three orders of cheeseburgers and fries on a rainy day.

It turned out, after Postmates investigated the order, that the courier had punched in the incorrect price for the food, which should have been $39.78. The company issued a refund for the difference.

HOUSTON — Such is the state of the oil industry these days that there is sometimes nowhere to put the oil. Off the coast of Texas, a line of roughly 40 tankers has formed, waiting to unload their crude or, in some cases, for a willing buyer to come along. Similar scenes are playing out off the coasts of Singapore and China and in the Persian Gulf.

There is little sign that the logjam will ease, as the price of oil continued its yearlong plunge this week, declining by nearly $10 a barrel.

The renewed collapse in crude prices is helping to again drive down gasoline prices for American drivers, to a national average of $2.19 a gallon for regular gasoline on Friday, according to the AAA motor club. That is 9 cents below the price a month ago and 73 cents below the price a year ago.

The slide in oil companies’ fortunes has been significant because of expanded production in Russia, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, as well as a slowdown in demand growth in China and the expectation by commodity traders that the Iran nuclear deal will introduce large quantities of oil to the glutted market.

The surge in production has led to a global stockpile of three billion barrels of crude, roughly the equivalent of a month of world oil production. The global market has not been this saturated since 2009, when demand for fuel plummeted.

“This massive cushion,” the International Energy Agency, based in Paris, noted in a report on Friday, has produced “an unprecedented buffer against geopolitical shocks or unexpected supply disruptions.”

The report helped to decrease the price of West Texas Intermediate, an American benchmark in oil pricing, by more than a dollar at one point on Friday. It almost reached $40 a barrel, its lowest level since last summer and before that in 2009. Oil prices were above $100 a barrel as recently as the summer of 2014.

The glut has left the tanks in Cushing, Okla., and other domestic supply depots brimming. The Energy Department noted that American crude inventories had grown last week to 487 million barrels and were nearly a third higher than a year ago. It was the seventh weekly increase in a row. Despite the glut, tankers full of African and Middle Eastern oil are still making their way to the Gulf of Mexico, in part because markets in Asia are also oversupplied.

But energy experts say that despite the huge stockpiles, the oil market could easily be shaken by a crisis in the Middle East, like a major terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia or a collapse in Iraq, and prices could soar again.

“The market is myopic,” said Steven Wood, a managing director at Moody’s Corporate Finance Group. “There is no spare capacity in the world. The market isn’t pricing in any risk, geopolitical risk, for oil.”

Still, Moody’s projects that oil prices will rise slowly, to an average for West Texas Intermediate crude of $48 a barrel in 2016 and $55 in 2017. The global Brent benchmark, now just under $44 a barrel, will rise to $53 in 2016 and to $60 in 2017, Moody’s projects.

Behind the low price projections is a sluggish world economy, experts say. The I.E.A. report on Friday suggested that world demand growth for oil would slow in 2016 to 1.2 million barrels a day after reaching a five-year high of 1.8 million barrels a day in 2015.

Low commodity prices and tight financing have forced oil companies in the United States to decommission more than half of their rigs, leading to tens of thousands of layoffs in oil states like Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma. To keep their leases, and unwilling to pay while drilling rigs already under contract stand idle, many operators are drilling wells without completing them — meaning that as soon as prices begin to revive, they can quickly complete the wells and begin production, thus forcing prices down again.

Investments in new exploration are down about 20 percent this year, and more cuts are expected in 2016.

Many in the industry expect large cash-rich companies like Exxon Mobil to buy small operators with strong shale positions that should be profitable when prices rebound.

Last week, Anadarko Petroleum, in a move to build a giant position in Texas’ shale fields, made a failed bid to buy Apache Corporation. Also, Concho Resources, a major West Texas producer, is reportedly making a quiet bid for Clayton Williams Energy, another Texas oil company.

“If the price is lower for longer, I do see more consolidation next year,” Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas producer, said in a recent interview. He added that “2016 is going to be another tough year.”

In a recent report, Citi Research said that the shale operators were “now being financially stress-tested by low prices, exposing shale’s dirty secret: Many shale producers outspend cash flow and thus depend on capital market injections to fund ongoing activity.”

Capital markets are responding by making lending practices tighter and loans more expensive. With many smaller producers borrowing on the high-yield markets, bond yields on energy issues have increased substantially in recent months. There have already been as many as eight company defaults this year.

But not everyone associated with the oil industry is losing these days. As the enormous ships sail in figure eights around the globe, the tanker companies are reaping the rewards, making as much as $70,000 a day, if not more, for their services.",An Oil-Soaked Globe as Production Keeps Climbing and Demand Falls,2015-11-14,"The renewed collapse in crude prices is helping to again drive down gasoline prices for American drivers, and a surge in production has led to a global stockpile of three billion barrels.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/business/energy-environment/an-oil-soaked-globe-as-production-keeps-climbing-and-demand-falls.html

HOUSTON — American travelers are being treated to bargains at the gasoline pump this Thanksgiving weekend. Prices are at their lowest level for the holiday since the financial crisis of 2008 despite heightened tensions in the Middle East and a spate of terrorist attacks that would normally lead to higher prices.

On Thursday, the national average for regular gasoline was $2.05 a gallon, 6 cents lower than only a week ago, and 76 cents lower than last year, according to the AAA motor club. AAA expects that nearly 42 million Americans will take road trips through the weekend.

The price of gasoline has tumbled for weeks. The biggest declines were in Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio and Minnesota as several Midwestern refineries, particularly Exxon Mobil’s plant in Joliet, Ill., finished their seasonal maintenance.

About 60 percent of the nation’s gas stations are selling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, with 75 percent of all sales nationwide below the $2 mark.

As the average driver consumes more than 60 gallons a month, most drivers will save $40 to $60 between Black Friday and Christmas, compared with last year, Mr. Kloza estimated, and up to $75 from the holiday season of 2013.

Those savings will be compounded for the few million consumers dependent on heating oil, mostly concentrated in New England and nearby states. The average consumer there may be able to save as much as $500 or more this winter on heating.

“It’s a nice gift, although I don’t know if the savings will be spent or be saved or go to paying off some debt,” Mr. Kloza said.

Wherever the savings go, he noted that they were remarkable given how much oil and gasoline prices historically have climbed during periods of unrest, particularly in the Middle East.

With crude oil prices still less than half what they were in the summer of 2014, the low gasoline prices are no big surprise to energy experts. “The market no longer fears a geopolitical price rally,” Mr. Kloza added. “It’s just a different mind-set that switched around the middle of last year.”

While the Turkish downing of a Russian warplane this week briefly sent oil prices upward on Tuesday, they came right back down. Even as worsening relations between Turkey and Russia put some natural gas pipeline projects in jeopardy, the incident had no direct, immediate effect on global oil supplies.

Gasoline prices are still relatively high on the Pacific Coast, with regular gasoline selling for an average of $2.71 a gallon in California. But with demand expected to decline over the next few weeks and refineries retooled for cheaper winter blends, experts say the national average for regular gasoline should fall below $2 a gallon by Christmas.

Behind the low prices are building crude inventories around the United States and the world, a sign that oil production remains resilient despite the price collapse and that demand remains soft in Europe as well as in China and other emerging markets.

Even as the crude supplies are building to record seasonal levels in the primary domestic storage hub at Cushing, Okla., producing countries in Africa and the Middle East keep sending oil to the Gulf of Mexico, hoping to find buyers for supplies they cannot sell in the glutted Asian markets.

Energy transport experts say the number of oil-carrying tankers in the Gulf of Mexico is triple the average, carrying nearly 30 million barrels of oil, according to Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, which tracks global crude shipments. Similar tanker traffic jams can be found off the coasts of Singapore, China and the Persian Gulf.

Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates are still pumping at record or near-record rates.

Oil production is dropping in the United States, but not fast enough to support oil prices much above $40 a barrel. That is putting a severe financial strain on many oil companies. According to the law firm Haynes & Boone, there were 36 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings by North American producers this year as of Nov. 5, accounting for $13 billion in secured and unsecured debt.

“Economic indicators suggest more producer bankruptcy filings will occur before the year is out,” the law firm stated in a new report.

The failure of so many mostly small companies, along with the rising number of rigs that companies are decommissioning around the country, are convincing many experts that the oil price will eventually rise next year at least modestly. Moreover, as the oil industry has retrenched, it has canceled more than $200 billion worth of projects around the world this year, and that should temper supply growth over the years to come.

Nevertheless, a significant rise in oil prices will come only after there is more pain in the oil patch, experts say.

“The oil price needs to average under $45 a barrel for four to six months to correct the balance and supply,” said Raoul LeBlanc, an oil expert at IHS, a consulting firm. Nevertheless, he added, “We’re setting ourselves up for a structural uptrend.”","Despite Global Events, U.S. Gasoline Prices Remain Low",2015-11-27,Prices for the Thanksgiving weekend are at their lowest since 2008 despite tensions in the Middle East and terrorist attacks.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/business/energy-environment/despite-global-events-us-gasoline-prices-remain-low.html
904,"Oil futures soared on Monday for a third consecutive day, rising more than 8 percent, as a downward revision of United States crude production data and the readiness of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to talk with other producers helped extend the biggest price surge in 25 years.

United States crude oil prices have skyrocketed more than $10 a barrel in three days, erasing the month’s declines as several relatively small supply disruptions and output risks prompted bearish traders to take profits on short positions, which were near record highs a week ago.

On Monday, prices fell initially but reversed at midmorning to accelerate into the close, extending gains beyond the 20 percent mark that often signals a bull market. Still, few were prepared to call an end to the slump.

“Sharp gains over the past three trading sessions were driven by a combination of short covering and chart readers again looking to call a bottom falsely,” Citigroup said in a report, adding that prices might test new lows this year.

Brent October futures rose $4.10, or 8.2 percent, to settle at $54.15 a barrel. Volumes were muted by a British holiday.

United States crude gained $3.98, or 8.8 percent, to settle at $49.20 a barrel, taking three-day gains to 27.5 percent, the most over three days since August 1990. In dollar terms, it is the biggest three-day gain since February 2011.

While some analysts had been warning of a price rebound after a one-third slump since late June, many expressed shock at the whiplash of the last few days.

On Monday, some cited a commentary in the latest OPEC Bulletin suggesting the group may be increasingly willing to talk to other producers about curbing output as a factor, though it was broadly in line with previous comments. Nothing this summer has indicated that core Gulf OPEC members are pushing for more talks.

The rally was also fueled by revised figures showing that American production in the first half of the year was lower than initially reported. Still, the figures were in line with the narrative of an industry in decline.

The Energy Information Administration said its new survey-based output figures showed the United States pumped slightly less than 9.3 million barrels per day in June, down 100,000 from the revised figure for May. The June number was also nearly 250,000 barrels per day below what the agency estimated a few weeks ago.",Oil Futures Rise 8% in 3rd Gain in a Row,2015-09-01,"Prices fell initially on Monday, but reversed at midmorning to accelerate into the close, extending gains beyond the 20 percent mark that often signals a bull market.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/business/energy-environment/oil-futures-rise-8-in-3rd-gain-in-a-row.html
905,"HOUSTON — Crude oil prices slid a further 5 percent on Monday to fall to their lowest levels since the 2009 global recession, pummeled by the fading chance that Saudi Arabia would cut production to halt the commodity’s yearlong slide.

In only 16 months global oil prices have collapsed from over $110 a barrel to less than half that, and the oil industry in the United States and around the world is reeling from its worst crisis since the late 1990s. On Monday, the American benchmark broke the $38-a-barrel mark, a price that makes drilling and completing wells a losing proposition in almost all oil fields around the country.

Oil stocks were sent tumbling, along with the rest of the market, as the price plunge put additional pressure on their finances. Kinder Morgan, the pipeline giant, said on Friday that it was reviewing its dividend. Shares of independent oil companies like Apache and ConocoPhillips fell by more than 3 percent on Monday.

“It’s another damaging blow to the U.S. oil industry,” said Steven H. Pruett, president and chief executive of Elevation Resources, a Texas oil company. “The rig count will continue to decline, the production decline will accelerate and capital spending plans will be curtailed further, as will employment.”

A variety of factors is behind the price drop, analysts say, including the surge in American and Iraqi oil production in recent years and a slowing in demand growth from China and other developing countries.

What’s the Current Price of Oil? Brent crude, the main international benchmark, was trading around $ a barrel on . The American benchmark was at around $ a barrel. This is why oil prices have dropped so much since 2014.

But it was the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia and a few Persian Gulf allies, in November 2014 not to cut production to shore up prices as it often had in the past, that sent prices into a collapse.

Last week, traders and oil executives held scant hopes that maybe Saudi Arabia would listen to the urgings of several OPEC nations like Venezuela, Iran, Ecuador and Algeria to cut production, and that maybe Russia and some other non-OPEC producers would join in the effort. But those hopes were dashed on Friday when OPEC refused to tinker with its output, which is now at near-record levels.

The refusal to cut production left American oil executives expressing concern about the future of the industry.

“They can continue to decimate our industry and it will take years to come back,” said Steve J. McCoy, director of business development for Latshaw Drilling, a drilling contractor based in Oklahoma. “They are doing their best to keep America from being energy self-sufficient or to have the ability to export.”

The Saudis’ actions are having the effect of forcing companies to reduce their shale production in the United States, which though expensive, has nearly doubled American oil output in recent years. The shale revolution, a relatively recent phenomenon, also threatens to increase production in many other countries that can eventually drill into their own hard rocks.

Several smaller American companies with higher debt loads have missed bond payments or been forced into bankruptcy. Domestic production has so far declined modestly because producers have been able to drill more efficiently and because their service companies have been forced to lower their prices, although output is expected to drop faster in 2016.

In the meantime, offshore oil production in the Gulf of Mexico continues to rebound from the 2010 BP oil spill and the federal drilling moratorium that followed.

An estimated 250,000 oil and gas workers have lost their jobs over the last year worldwide. In Texas, the biggest American producer, at least 50,000 jobs have been lost.

OPEC officials said that before they made any decision about future production cuts, they wanted to see the impact on global markets of new barrels from Iran — expected to be as many as 500,000 a day by the second half of 2016 — as Tehran complies with the recent nuclear deal. They also suggested that Saudi Arabia might be willing to cut as long as other major producers were willing to do the same.

Many oil analysts have compared the Saudi strategy to a game of chicken to see which large producers would blink first. But the strategy holds risks for Saudi Arabia, which relies on oil for 85 percent of its exports and much of its government financing.

Though the Saudis continue to have hefty reserves, the International Monetary Fund has warned that they could run out of cash in five years because of the reduced revenues and high social spending they rely on to keep domestic peace.

911,"WASHINGTON — Producer prices in the United States rose more than expected in June as the cost of gasoline and a range of other goods rose, indicating that the recent oil-driven downward pressure on prices was abating.

Other data on Wednesday showed a rebound in industrial production last month.

The Labor Department said its producer price index increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in May. It was the second consecutive month of increase in producer prices, and it beat economist expectations for a 0.2 percent gain.

A 0.7 percent rise in the prices of goods accounted for nearly two-thirds of the increase in the producer price index last month.

Gasoline prices increased 4.3 percent after surging 17 percent in May. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, rose 0.2 percent in June after increasing 0.6 percent in May.

A plunge in crude oil prices and a resurgent dollar have subdued producer inflation and damped overall domestic price pressures.

Inflation is stabilizing as oil prices steadily rise, but a strong dollar suggests any increase will be gradual.

HOUSTON — With oil prices collapsing and companies in retrenchment, a federal auction in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday attracted the lowest interest from producers since 1986.

It was the clearest sign yet that the fortunes of oil companies are skidding so fast that they now need to cut back on plans for production well into the future.

The auction, for drilling leases, attracted a scant $22.7 million in sales from five companies, but energy analysts said that came as no surprise on a day when the American oil benchmark price plummeted by more than 4 percent. For the first time since the recession, it is approaching the symbolic $40-a-barrel level. Last summer, it was above $100 a barrel.

A glut on American and world markets is to blame for the depressed prices, but the unusually large daily decline occurred after the Energy Department, in a report, lowered its oil price projections and showed a considerable increase in inventories.

Until now, most companies have insisted that they would not sacrifice production in future years when they said oil prices were sure to rebound strongly. But in recent weeks, executives have expressed concern that the oil price collapse could last through 2016 and even 2017, and it is important that they tighten their belts even more.

“The financial squeeze is tighter than people thought, so tight that the companies can’t even bargain-hunt for leases for future production,” said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consultancy. “It’s the long-term production profile that is suffering now, and they will pay for it later.”

The auction on Wednesday was more notable for the companies that were absent than for those that participated.

BHP Billiton dominated the bidding, and Anadarko Petroleum and BP picked up a few blocks. But ExxonMobil, Shell Oil and Chevron — giants that lead in the region — did not bother to participate at a time when they are focusing on cutting costs and are struggling to save cash to protect their dividends.

“This sale reflects today’s market conditions,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, director of the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. “The continuing drop in oil prices and low natural gas prices obviously affect industry’s short-term investment decisions, but the gulf’s long-term value to the nation remains high.”

Offshore drilling, particularly in deep waters, is some of the most expensive exploration done by oil companies around the world. Nevertheless, since the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster that left 11 workers dead and soiled hundreds of miles of beaches, and the one-year drilling moratorium that followed, production in the gulf has flourished.

The Energy Department on Wednesday noted that with a total of 13 production projects coming on line this year and next, output in the gulf would increase from an average of 1.4 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 1.6 million barrels a day in late 2016. That surge will partly offset an expected decline in onshore production because oil companies have reduced their rig count on land by more than 60 percent since last year.

The Energy Department, in its short-term energy outlook, projected a domestic production increase from an average of 8.7 million barrels a day last year to 9.4 million barrels a day in 2015 before overall output declines to nine million barrels next year. The resilient production in the United States, with rising production from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, has produced a surplus of oil around the globe of an estimated two million barrels a day.

One outgrowth of that surplus is the challenge of where to put all the oil.

Domestic storage alone rose 2.6 million barrels in mid-August, the report noted, because of an unexpected surge in imports and a drop in refinery processing after a breakdown in the BP refinery in Whiting, Ind.

Current crude stockpiles of 456 million barrels in the United States are at levels rarely if ever seen at this time of year since World War II. Once the summer driving season ends and other regional refineries begin their seasonal retooling, the domestic glut of crude is likely to grow even larger and the price of oil and gasoline will fall further, analysts said.

The Energy Department forecast that the American benchmark oil price would average $49 a barrel this year, $6 lower than it estimated last month. It forecast a price of $54 in 2016, $8 lower than it projected last month.

“Concerns over the pace of economic growth in emerging markets, continuing (albeit slowing) supply growth, increases in global liquids inventories, and the possibility of increasing volumes of Iranian crude entering the market contributed to the changed forecast,” the department report said.

Offshore drilling has suffered from the overall oil market downdraft. Hercules Offshore, a leading shallow-water gulf driller, filed for bankruptcy this month and Fitch Ratings has suggested that more bankruptcies among offshore drillers may be coming soon.

An oversupply of rigs is developing as contracts expire. Fitch recently estimated in a report that day rates for ultra-deepwater rigs, which have generally run between $400,000 to $600,000 in recent years, will come down to $325,000.

“The market remains challenging, and we are in the midst of a significant downturn in offshore drilling,” Anthony Kandylidis, executive vice president of Ocean Rig, a leading drilling contractor, told analysts this month as he announced the suspension of the company’s dividend. “The recent volatility in the price of oil and increased availability of drilling units do not allow for a short-term market improvement.”

Only five companies submitted 33 bids for 33 blocks spanning 190,000 acres of gulf waters in Wednesday’s auction, representing a sharp decline that reflects a growing consensus in the industry that the oil price is not going to recover anytime soon.",Oil Companies Sit on Hands at Auction for Leases,2015-08-20,The low turnout at the Gulf of Mexico auction was the clearest sign yet that the fortunes of oil companies are skidding so fast that they now must reduce plans for production well into the future.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/business/oil-drillers-sit-on-hands-at-auction-for-leases.html

LONDON — The British oil giant BP said on Tuesday that its profit was down sharply in the third quarter as depressed oil prices took a heavy toll.

The company, saying it expects prices to stay low for years, indicated that it would continue to cut costs and limit its investments in searching for and developing new oil and gas fields.

“We are now in action to rebalance our financial framework in this new price environment,” BP’s chief executive, Robert W. Dudley, said in a statement.

The company said its profit in the quarter was $46 million, compared with $1.3 billion a year earlier. Profit on the basis of underlying replacement cost, a more widely used figure, fell to $1.8 billion for the quarter from $3 billion a year earlier.

BP said it was holding its quarterly dividend at 10 cents a share, payable in December.

The sharply lower earnings reflect the steep fall in oil and natural gas prices from a year earlier. Trading around $50 a barrel for much of the quarter, Brent crude prices were only about half their level a year earlier. Natural gas prices were off by nearly a third.

In its announcement on Tuesday, the company said it was basing its outlook through 2017 on oil prices of $60 a barrel.

In a call with analysts, Mr. Dudley backed up this view with a slide showing that the futures market was now forecasting oil prices of $60 to $70 per barrel into the 2020s. That is a large drop from earlier this year, when the projections were for about $70 per barrel in 2017 and about $80 by 2021.

“Obviously the landscape has changed,” he said.

Extracting oil and gas from the ground and the seafloor was once the big money earner for BP, but because of the decline in crude oil prices, refining and marketing petroleum products — long a drag on earnings because of their lower profit margins — have more recently helped keep the company in the black.

For the third quarter, marketing, refining and petrochemicals earned $2.3 billion, a 55 percent increase over a year earlier, while earnings from exploring for and producing oil and gas fell nearly 80 percent to $823 million.

The company said that job cuts made over the last year would total about 4,000 by the end of December, when it expects its global work force to be about 80,000. That figure includes about 20,000 agricultural workers on biofuel projects and gas station workers.

Over the years, BP has sold many of its poorly performing refineries and invested in upgrades of some of the remaining units. BP said its refining margins were $20 a barrel in the third quarter, up from $15.60 a year ago.

Mr. Dudley has been among those saying that the industry needs to prepare for a long period of low prices. Analysts, including some inside BP, say oil and gas prices are likely to remain depressed indefinitely.

In a recent study, Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, wrote that “the principles and beliefs that served us well in the past are no longer as useful for analyzing the oil market.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Dale wrote that with known global oil reserves more than doubling since 1980, and the appetite for fossil fuels potentially diminished in the face of growing concerns about the role of carbon emissions in climate change, the world would probably not run out of oil. Without the threat of an eventual scarcity, “there is no longer a strong reason to expect the relative price of oil to increase over time,” he wrote.

To prepare for this challenging business environment, the company continues to cut operating costs through staff cuts and other measures that trimmed $3 billion in cash outflows in the first nine months of 2015. It has also sharply cut back spending on items like drilling and developing new oil fields from the $24 billion to $26 billion originally forecast for this year.

BP said its capital spending this year would be around $19 billion, compared with about $23 billion in 2014. BP said it would keep capital outlays in the range of $17 billion to $19 billion through 2017. Exploration costs were cut by more than half in the third quarter, to $356 million.

Mr. Dudley said that BP was working to reduce the costs of future projects in various ways, including waiting for the price of items like drilling rigs to fall. He estimated that the average price tag of BP’s planned future investments had already declined about 15 percent in the last 12 months.

But many analysts say the major oil companies could do plenty more in terms of cost-cutting.

Lessons may be learned from the shale oil industry, whose millions of additional barrels in global supplies may have been the single most important factor in driving down prices.

The shale oil operators have also taken a lean, almost factory-style approach to oil and gas operations — for instance, by using technology that smooths and speeds drilling and makes it more precise. The question is whether some of the techniques can be applied to activities like offshore oil and gas extraction, which are now quite costly.

BP shareholders and management at least have a much clearer idea of the final bill for the Gulf of Mexico disaster of 2010. This month, the company reached a $20.8 billion final settlement with the United States government and the gulf states.

The company says the payments, stretched out over nearly two decades, will be manageable.

BP said its total provision for outlays from the Gulf of Mexico disaster had reached $55 billion.","Profit Down at BP, Which Predicts Era of Low Oil Prices",2015-10-28,"The company said it would maintain its dividend but was acting to “rebalance our financial framework in this new price environment.""",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/business/energy-environment/bp-earnings-oil-third-quarter.html

HOUSTON — The nuclear agreement with Iran opens the way for a flood of new oil eventually to pour onto world markets, setting up a potential windfall for energy giants.

But it will take a year or more before Iran can increase production significantly, delaying any impact on oil prices.

“It’s not just a matter of turning on the taps again,” said Andrew Slaughter, executive director of the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions. “They will need some investments and technology.”

With nearly 10 percent of global oil reserves and 18 percent of natural gas reserves, Iran is potentially an energy market mover that can compete with producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia. As optimism increased for a nuclear deal, oil giants like Royal Dutch Shell, Total of France and Eni of Italy looked for investment opportunities in Iran in recent weeks.

Even after years of underinvestment and mismanagement of its aging oil fields, Iran has a production capacity of 3.5 million barrels a day, roughly 4 percent of global output. It is already a major supplier to China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey.

Oil companies are not the only businesses eyeing Iran. With some exceptions for food and medical supplies, American companies have been prohibited from selling to Iran since the 1979 takeover of the United States embassy in Tehran.

If sanctions are lifted, consumer-oriented companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81 million consumers, many of whom are young.

Iranians have already shown a taste for smuggled Apple products and American cigarettes. Coffee shops have emerged in Iranian cities that look like Starbucks, suggesting there could be an opening for Western restaurant chains. Even before the signing of the deal, the French government told Peugeot and Citroen that sanctions on motor parts will most likely be lifted by the end of the year.

Iran is also considered a strong emerging market play, giving a potential opening to investment firms and trading companies. For the last two years, mostly European brokerage houses have held discussions with Iranian players to find future business on the local stock exchange.

Significant hurdles remain. Congress could still torpedo the agreement, although President Obama has pledged to veto such an effort.

For oil giants, the payoff, and the potential problems, are even greater.

The Iran oil industry is in a state of disarray. For most of the last three decades, Iran has been off limits to Western oil companies because of sanctions and Iranian laws that limit the profitability of private energy investments.

Without modern technology and new investment, oil and gas fields have been in sharp decline. The country has lost a million barrels a day of exports since 2012.

Iranian officials have been promising to regain those barrels quickly once a deal is signed. At the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting last month, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, predicted a quick export rebound of 400,000 barrels a day and an additional 600,000 barrels after six months.

But most independent oil analysts say Iran’s projections are overly optimistic. “It should take a good year between the day they sign the agreement and when they add 500,000 barrels of production a day,” said Gary Ross, executive chairman and head of global oil at the Pira Energy Group, an international consultancy.

Mr. Ross said the world market should be able to absorb the extra barrels. Production in many countries is declining with oil prices slipping. Global demand has been increasing.

“With each day, the market will be in a better position to accommodate the incremental Iranian oil,” Mr. Ross added.

The agreement announced had little immediate impact on either global or American oil price benchmarks, as both remained above $50 a barrel on Tuesday, roughly half the price of a year ago. The global market of 94 million barrels of oil a day is glutted, with an oversupply of one to two million barrels.

Iran has as much as 40 million barrels of crude in storage on supertankers at sea — nearly half of what the world consumes in a day — that it may soon try to release on the market. But some analysts say the stored oil is of poor quality and most refineries may be incapable of processing it.

Otherwise, the agreement details that the oil sanctions will be removed only when the United States and its allies are convinced that Tehran is modifying nuclear equipment, dismantling centrifuges and allowing detailed inspections. Oil experts said verification could mean months of delays.

The lifting of oil sanctions has been one of Iran’s prime foreign policy objectives. Its government finances and national economy are highly dependent on oil sales. The sanctions have caused major delays and cancellations in projects, partly because of the state oil company’s lack of money.

About 70 percent of Iran’s oil reserves are onshore in fields that are easily accessible. The remainder is mostly in the Persian Gulf, as well as in the Caspian Sea, where advanced exploration could significantly bolster output, according to oil experts.

Senior executives of Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Eni met with Iran’s oil minister in Vienna in June, and there have been other meetings in Tehran in recent months between the oil companies and Iranian officials.

Shell says it has already discussed potential areas of cooperation with Iran, assuming that the sanctions are lifted. “Strictly within the boundaries of the law, we are interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran’s energy potential,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

The companies are likely to invest the tens of billions of dollars required to give a major lift to Iranian production only if they are comfortable with the terms offered. Before the sanctions, Iranian deals generated low returns and did not permit the international companies to book the reserves or oil in the ground, which are important to investors’ valuation of oil companies. Iranian officials say they are working on new contracts, but they have not disclosed full details.

“Iran has a massive resource base,” said Kenneth B. Medlock, the director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. “If Western capital can flow in there, that will be the first place it wants to go because of its relatively low-cost oil.”","A New Stream of Oil for Iran, but Not Right Away",2015-07-15,"Years of neglect mean that Iran’s oil industry will not be able to increase production much in the short term, experts say.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/business/international/iran-nuclear-deal-oil-prices.html
917,"“Connecting U.S. oil production to global markets will have immediate national security impacts,” said David Goldwyn, who was the top energy diplomat in the State Department during the first Obama administration, “and as the market recovers it will enable struggling American companies to meet rising demand.

Environmentalists have long opposed the change in policy, contending it will encourage more drilling and production when they say the world should be shifting to renewable energy. They say more oil production means more hydraulic fracturing, air pollution and threats to local water supplies. That is why Democratic lawmakers insisted that the repeal be accompanied by an extension of tax credits for wind and solar energy.

The promise of those extensions — along with those aimed at promoting the development of biofuels, especially those derived from nonfood sources — prompted a collective sigh of relief among clean energy executives and investors.

Stock prices, which had tumbled in recent months in the face of volatility in the sector, rallied. SolarCity, for example, was up about 30 percent to around $52 in the afternoon, practically double where it was a month ago, while SunEdison, whose stock has languished below $10 since September, had climbed roughly 30 percent to above $6.

The production tax credit for wind, which had expired at the end of 2014 and helped bring the cost of wind power near or below that of conventional fuels in many parts of the country, is to be extended retroactively until the end of next year and then decline in value each year until it is phased out in 2020. The investment tax credit for solar, which was to decrease to 10 percent, from 30 percent, at the end of next year, is to stay at 30 percent until 2019 and then gradually step down until 2022.

Energy policy experts said that the agreement allowed Republicans and Democrats to claim victory, but was also a sign that the transition to a lower-carbon economy promised in the Paris climate talks was already an industry reality.

“Extending the wind and solar tax credits for the rest of the decade allows the White House to say they have provided businesses certainty to expand renewable investment,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Senate Finance Committee staff member and Clinton administration climate official. “Republicans can now say they phased down the renewable energy tax credits to zero in five years, ending subsidies many of them opposed.”

But energy experts said it was the repeal of the oil export ban that carried the most symbolic weight. They noted that conditions in the global oil markets could change suddenly at any time, given the instability of North Africa, the Middle East and in other major producing countries like Venezuela and Nigeria. American oil on world markets could serve as a buffer for future shocks.

Lifting the ban, they said, sends a telling message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that the United States can push for stronger sanctions against Russian oil without jeopardizing the economies of countries that buy its oil, especially in Europe. It also means that if Iran does not comply with its nuclear agreement and sanctions are snapped back, Iranian customers like India and Japan can look to the United States as an important new oil source.

“The U.S. crude oil export ban is the symbolic manifestation of the historical trauma of America’s experience of the 1973 oil embargo,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis. “Taking this law off the books reflects the new reality of America’s energy power.”

The repeal would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, when domestic production fell year after year until the shale revolution took hold in 2007 and 2008. Using hydraulic fracturing to blast through hard rocks with water, sand and chemicals, the industry began to produce in fields that had been largely worthless. Oil production nearly doubled by early this year to more than nine million barrels a day, replacing most imports from the Middle East and North Africa.

The export ban has covered crude produced in the lower 48 states and exports other than those to Canada, while exports of processed fuels like gasoline and diesel have been allowed. The Obama administration has tinkered with the ban, allowing in 2014 the export of a limited amount of extra light oil, mostly coming out of the shale fields of Texas and North Dakota. This year it gave permission to export some more to Mexico in a swap for heavier Mexican crude desired by refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.

With the price collapse over the last year, companies are decommissioning rigs and production is beginning to drop. Few executives think 2016 will be much better, and companies are cutting their exploration budgets.

The United States already exports 4.5 million barrels a day of refined petroleum products like gasoline and diesel, and industry executives say an additional half million barrels to a million barrels a day of crude exports could come over the next several years. That is not a large number considering that the global market is roughly 94 million barrels a day.

“U.S. crude exports are unlikely to impact the big picture in global oil markets given that the U.S. is still a major importer of crude to the tune of seven million barrels a day or close to 7 percent of current global production,” said Badr H. Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an oil company based in the United Arab Emirates. “Any U.S. exports will have to be matched by increased imports, leaving the global crude supply-demand balance unchanged.”",Expected Repeal of Oil Export Ban Unlikely to Have Immediate Impact,2015-12-17,"American executives hope for an increase in drilling and jobs, but a big expansion of markets may not happen soon.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/business/energy-environment/expected-repeal-of-oil-export-ban-unlikely-to-have-immediate-impact.html

HOUSTON — BP has restarted a large distillation unit at a refinery outside Chicago that broke down on Aug. 8 and caused a jump in gasoline prices across the Midwest.

Energy experts said the repair at the refinery, in Whiting, Ind., should give drivers around the Great Lakes region relief at the pump in the coming weeks, while gasoline prices across most of the rest of the country are declining rapidly.

“Restart of this unit is increasing the refinery’s fuel production, with output ramping up over time,” BP said in a brief statement on Tuesday to announce that the refinery unit was working again. The company did not specify how long it would take for the unit to return to full production.

Leaky pipes at the refinery caused wholesale gasoline prices to rise by up to 80 cents a gallon around the Great Lakes states. Michigan and Illinois drivers saw jumps of 15 to 25 cents a gallon from one day to the next, causing concern and frustration among motorists.

GasBuddy.com predicts that drivers around the region should pay 20 to 50 cents less per gallon over the next few weeks as the refinery unit increases production.

The national average price for a gallon of regular gas was $2.58 on Tuesday, eight cents lower than a week ago and 86 cents lower than a year ago, according to the AAA motor club.

That price is the lowest for this time of year since 2004, but the numbers would have been far better had they not been skewed by the refinery breakdown and other failures and renovations at refineries in California and in the Midwest.

The resumption at the Whiting refinery is particularly good news for Canadian producers because it is one of the primary processors of Canadian heavy crude in the United States. Rising inventories north of the border were forcing the price of Canadian crude to levels so low that much of the production in western Canada was no longer profitable.",Midwest Gasoline Prices to Normalize After BP Refinery Repair,2015-08-26,Gas prices in the Great Lakes states had jumped after a distillation unit at a BP refinery outside Chicago broke down on Aug. 8.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/business/energy-environment/midwest-gasoline-prices-likely-to-ease-after-a-bp-refinery-is-restarted.html

A breakdown at a BP refinery outside Chicago is sending jolts across the energy markets of the Midwest and Canada, pushing up gasoline prices even as oil prices over all reached a six-year low.

Since a mechanical breakdown at BP’s refinery in Whiting, Ind., on Saturday, the wholesale price of gasoline has climbed 50 to 80 cents a gallon in a region that stretches from Great Lakes states like Michigan to as far south as parts of Kansas and Oklahoma.

In Illinois, the average price at the pump jumped on Thursday by 15 cents, to $2.78 a gallon for regular gasoline, according to AAA. In Michigan, regular gasoline jumped by even more, 23 cents a gallon to $2.81, AAA said, an almost unheard-of increase, except when hurricanes barrel through the refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.

Consumers around the area expressed confusion and frustration.

“If I had known this was going to happen, I could’ve filled up yesterday,” said Nancy Nester, a psychotherapist from West Bloomfield, Mich., as she fueled her car. “It makes me angry.” Ms. Nester’s Lexus calls for premium fuel, but she used regular instead to save money.

Drivers in almost all other parts of the country are paying considerably less than they were at the beginning of the summer as crude oil prices continue their sharp decline. On Thursday, the American benchmark for oil fell to $42 a barrel, a six-year low.

At the Whiting refinery, leaky pipes on a crude distillation unit built to process Canadian heavy crude forced BP to shut the unit, and experts say it could take as much as a month to fix the problem.

“It is a mess,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. “It might take a month to fix, and it’s a bad month to miss because you can still see a lot of summer driving.”

Refinery breakdowns are not unusual, but this one comes at a particularly bad time for Canadian oil producers. Because the Whiting plant is one of the primary processors of Canadian heavy crude in the United States, inventories are building north of the border.

The price of Western Canada Select, the benchmark for diluted bitumen from Alberta’s oil sands, sank to roughly $23 a barrel this week — about half the price of an American barrel of crude.

Canadian producers were already suffering from overproduction and a couple of pipeline breakdowns when the BP refinery experienced its problems. But the new breakdown is particularly damaging for Canadian producers and the Canadian economy, because the weeks leading up to Labor Day weekend have some of the heaviest demand of the year.

BP issued a short statement saying that it had shut down the largest of three distillation units at the plant “for unscheduled repair work.”

The company added: “BP is working to safely restart the unit as soon as possible. In the meantime, the company is working to meet its fuel supply obligations.”

The Whiting refinery is the largest in the Midwest and seventh largest in the country. It can refine as much as 270,000 barrels a day of diluted bitumen piped from Canada. The refinery has a total capacity to process 413,000 barrels of crude a day to produce 19 million gallons of fuel.

The problems at Whiting caps a summer of snags at various refineries in California, Missouri and other states that have led to sporadic higher regional prices, especially on the West Coast. Nevertheless, drivers on average have been paying a dollar less for a gallon of gasoline than they were last summer.

At the same time, refiners have been benefiting from the glut of cheap domestic oil and have been producing record amounts refined fuels. Refiners are making hefty profits, selling their reformulated gasoline on the spot market for $25, $50 and sometimes as much as $100 more per barrel than their cost of crude depending on the region.

“It has been a golden summer for refiners,” Mr. Kloza said.

But it is not a golden month for Michigan drivers.

“It seems like they keep coming up with all these mysterious reasons why the prices fluctuate,” said Jenny Osgood of suburban Southfield, Mich., “but who can really understand them?”",Breakdown at BP Refinery Strains Midwest Gas Prices ,2015-08-14,"Since a breakdown at BP’s refinery in Whiting, Ind., the wholesale price of gas has climbed 50 to 80 cents a gallon in a broad region of the country.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/business/breakdown-at-bp-refinery-strains-midwest-gas-prices.html
920,"Two drugs sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International to treat cancer-related skin conditions increased in price by about 1,700 percent over the last six years, according to a newly published survey that found big increases in the cost of dermatology drugs across the board.

Over all, retail prices of 19 brand-name dermatology drugs from various manufacturers, for acne, infections and other conditions, quintupled from 2009 to this year. Even some generic drugs almost quadrupled in price, according to the study, which was published on Wednesday by the journal JAMA Dermatology.

“We’re not talking about new drugs,” said Dr. Steven P. Rosenberg, a dermatologist in West Palm Beach, Fla., who led the research. “We’re not talking about exotic drugs. We’re not talking about drugs that are listed as being in shortage.”

The price increases, he said, “have been off the charts. None of this makes any sense other than that they can get away with it.”

The two biggest increases were the Valeant drugs. The drugstore price of a tube of Targretin gel, a topical treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, rose to about $30,320 this year, 18 times as much as the $1,687 in 2009. Most of that increase appears to have occurred after Valeant acquired the drug early in 2013. A patient might need two tubes a month for several months, Dr. Rosenberg said.

The retail price of a tube of Carac cream, used to treat precancerous skin lesions called actinic keratoses, rose to $2,865 this summer, also 18 times the 2009 price of $159. Virtually all of the increase occurred after 2011, when Valeant acquired the product. A typical treatment requires one tube, Dr. Rosenberg said.

Valeant and some other drug companies have been drawing scrutiny from Congress, hospitals and patients for acquiring old drugs for a variety of diseases and sharply increasing their prices. Federal prosecutors have also begun inquiries into Valeant’s pricing practices. Valeant’s shares have plummeted in the last two months.

Valeant said in a statement Wednesday that it would be expected to have several drugs on the list because it has the largest market share in dermatology not counting biotech drugs, which were not included in the study.

It said the retail prices cited in the study “rarely represent the prices that patients and insurers are paying or what the pharmaceutical company receives,” and that it offered financial assistance to many patients. It also said that four of the five Valeant drugs cited in the study, including Targretin and Carac, have generic alternatives available, meaning that doctors and patients are not forced to use the brand-name product.

The published study does not name Valeant or any other manufacturer, nor does it really criticize them.

Valeant also said recently that it would sever its ties to a mail-order pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, which was used to bolster sales of its dermatology drugs. Media reports had suggested that Philidor, which accounted for about 7 percent of Valeant’s overall sales in the third quarter, had used questionable tactics to get insurers to pay for the drugs.

Other dermatology drug companies also use mail-order pharmacies because they are less likely than a drugstore to substitute a generic for a brand-name product. Pharmacy benefit managers are now challenging this use of mail-order pharmacies.

Rising Prices for Acne Drugs The average prices of many common medications for acne or rosacea have risen sharply since 2009. Two of those that rose most were Valeant’s Benzaclin and Retin-A Micro. SELECTED MEDICATIONS/ PERCENT INCREASE 2009-15 AVERAGE PRICE 2009 2015 $0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 MANUFACTURER Retina-A Micro, 0.1%, 50 g +414% VALEANT Benzaclin, 50 g +202% VALEANT Tazorac Cream, 0.1%, 60 g +171% ALLERGAN Finacea, 50 g +129% BAYER Oracea, 40 g (30 tablets) +60% GALDERMA SELECTED MEDICATIONS/ AVERAGE PRICE PERCENT INCREASE 2009-15 MANUFACTURER 2009 2015 Retina-A Micro 0.1%, 50 g $178 $915 +414% VALEANT Benzaclin 50 g $167 $504 +202% VALEANT Tazorac Cream 0.1%, 60 g $266 $722 +171% ALLERGAN Finacea 50 g $124 $284 +129% BAYER Oracea 40 g (30 tablets) $439 $702 +60% GALDERMA

On Wednesday, a federal judge in Albany declined to stop the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts from terminating its relationship with the pharmacy Linden Care, which dispenses expensive pain pills sold by Horizon Pharma. Linda Clark, a lawyer for Linden Care, said it would appeal the decision on an emergency basis to try to prevent disruptions in patient care.

Dermatologists say price rises, and an increasing tendency of pharmacy benefit managers to refuse to pay for certain drugs they view as unnecessarily expensive, are making it difficult for patients to obtain the drugs they prescribe. The American Academy of Dermatology established a task force on pharmaceutical prices and price transparency this year to try to come up with solutions.

Access to treatments is being “limited because of costs and the burden they are placing on our patients,” said the task force’s chairman, Dr. Bruce A. Brod, a dermatologist in Lancaster, Pa., who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania medical school.

Dr. Rosenberg, who is also a volunteer professor at the University of Miami, said he did not set out to publish a study. He wanted simply to inform other dermatologists in Florida about the costs of the drugs they were prescribing.

“Some of the physicians were shocked to find out that the cost of the medicine was $500 or $600 and there was an alternative that was more reasonable,” Dr. Rosenberg said.

So he and his daughter, Miranda E. Rosenberg, now a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania, surveyed four drugstores in West Palm Beach that were part of the chains Costco, CVS, Sam’s Club and Walgreens. While prices can vary somewhat geographically, the basic findings should hold true nationwide, the authors say.

The 2009 survey results, posted on the website of a Florida dermatology society, proved popular enough that they repeated it in 2011 and 2014, using the same drugstores. When they saw how much prices had jumped from 2011 to 2014, they decided to publish, using a representative sample of 19 drugs.

Prices for seven of the drugs more than quadrupled in that period. Valeant accounted for four of them: Targretin, Carac, Retin-A Micro for acne and Oxsoralen-Ultra for psoriasis.

Two of the drugs — Solaraze for actinic keratoses and Oxistat cream for athlete’s foot and jock itch — are made by PharmaDerm, which is owned by Novartis. The seventh drug, Derma-Smoothe/FS oil, a steroid to treat atopic dermatitis, is from Royal Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey.

Dermatology represented the 11th-biggest therapeutic category for drugs in 2014, with 109 million prescriptions, according to IMS Health. It said sales of such drugs totaled $9.5 billion before discounts that year.

Many dermatology drugs do not contain novel ingredients. Carac, for instance, is made of fluorouracil, a decades-old chemotherapy drug. Targretin contains a vitamin A derivative known as a retinoid.

Manufacturers make new formulations they say provide better results. Dr. Brod said that particular formulations might be best for certain patients, and doctors need a full choice of products. But others are skeptical.

“There hasn’t really been a new drug in dermatology for a long time,” said Dr. Robert Rudolph, a recently retired dermatologist in Wyomissing, Pa., who also teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. “They are just slightly tweaking something and jacking up the price.”","2 Valeant Dermatology Drugs Lead Steep Price Increases, Study Finds",2015-11-26,"The study found that prices for 19 brand-name dermatology drugs increased about 400 percent in the last six years, but two of Valeant’s increases were the biggest.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/business/2-valeant-dermatology-drugs-lead-steep-price-increases-study-finds.html
921,"HOUSTON — Oil prices jumped for a second day on Friday, sending the United States benchmark past $45 a barrel, a gain of 17 percent in only two days.

But most energy experts discounted the surge as a temporary trading event, with speculators scurrying to eliminate their short trading positions, and said oil was likely to fall below $40 again.

“There is no substantial change in either the demand or supply side,” said Tobias Read, chief executive of Swift Worldwide Resources, a Houston-based global oil and gas staffing firm.

One event moving the oil markets on Friday was a report of a Saudi ground offensive in northern Yemen, which raised concern that renewed Middle East turbulence might disrupt energy supplies.

But the oil market has roughly followed the mood on Wall Street in recent weeks, which has been shaken by fears about China’s economic outlook.

The two-day rebound in prices, which had dipped as low as $37 a barrel in recent days and which remain more than 50 percent below last summer’s levels, suggested to some analysts that the market might have established or approached a low.

In an investor note on Friday, Morgan Stanley identified several possible catalysts for an oil price recovery, including a potentially large Chinese fiscal stimulus package to foster greater economic growth, more resilient United States economic growth, a future decline in American oil production, and a congressional vote against the Iran nuclear deal, which it said “could undermine confidence in the deal’s success.”

One reason for the recent price decline is the prospect that Iran could provide as much as a million more barrels a day to the 94-million-barrel global market in a year or so if sanctions are lifted. The market today is as much as two million barrels a day oversupplied.

But most oil company executives remain skeptical that oil prices will again approach the $100-a-barrel level anytime soon. They note that China faces continuing economic turmoil that could deplete demand for energy throughout the developing world economies that have been supplying it with raw materials and buying its manufactured goods.

They also note that Saudi Arabia and Iraq show no sign of slowing their record-breaking production, while American production has been surprisingly resilient in the face of slumping prices. Oil inventories remain at record levels for this time of the year in the United States.

“Markets and analysts are increasingly pessimistic about demand growth and supply declines materializing,” said Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an oil company based in the United Arab Emirates. “The global supply surplus remains in place, with inventories continuing to build worldwide.”

Motorists continue to benefit from the low prices as the summer driving season enters its final weeks. The average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $2.51, according to the AAA motor club, down 12 cents from a week ago and down 92 cents from a year ago.","Oil Prices Jump 17 Percent in Two Days, Despite Glut",2015-08-29,"The United States benchmark rate passed $45 a barrel on concerns of Middle East turbulence, still 50 percent below last summer&#8217;s levels.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/business/oil-prices-jump-17-percent-in-two-days-despite-glut.html
922,"When gas prices fall, Americans reliably do two things that don’t make much sense.

They spend more of the windfall on gasoline than they would if the money came from somewhere else.

And they don’t just buy more gasoline. They switch from regular gas to high-octane.

A new report by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, looking at the impact of lower gas prices on consumer spending, finds the same pattern as earlier studies. The average American would have saved about $41 a month last winter by buying the same gallons and grades. Instead, Americans took home roughly $22 a month. People, in other words, used almost half of the windfall to buy more and fancier gas.

This is not rational behavior. Americans spent about 4 percent of pretax income on gas in 2014. One might expect them to spend about the same share of any windfall at the pump — maybe a little more because gas got cheaper. Instead they spent almost half.

Americans, in short, have not been behaving like the characters in economics textbooks.

There is, however, a pretty good explanation for this kind of pattern. Researchers have found that people treat money as earmarked for particular kinds of spending, a tendency behavioral economists call “mental accounting.” If someone is buying rounds at the neighborhood bar, people tend to treat the money they didn’t spend as “beer money,” and sooner or later they tend to spend it disproportionately on beer. As a result, they end up drinking more beer than they had originally intended.

The JPMorgan study compares gas spending between December 2013 and February 2014, when prices averaged $3.31 a gallon, with gas spending by the same people in the same period one year later, when average prices were one dollar lower. The study found that the average American spent $136 per month on gas during the high-price period and $114 per month on gas during the low-price period. While the price of gas fell by roughly 30 percent, spending on gas declined by only 16 percent.

The study, based on the spending patterns of about one million JPMorgan customers, does not track the kind of gas consumers purchased. It shows that people bought more gas as prices fell, and that the increase in consumption is not sufficient to explain the entirety of the increase in spending on gas.

We know how that extra money was probably spent thanks to a separate 2013 study by the economists Justine Hastings of Brown University and Jesse M. Shapiro of the University of Chicago, who got their hands on detailed accounts of the purchases made by 61,494 households at an unidentified retail chain that also sold gas.

Professors Hastings and Shapiro showed that households adjusted their gas consumption much more sharply in response to changes in gas prices than in response to equivalent changes in overall income. In the fall of 2008, for example, as gas prices fell amid a broad economic collapse, consumers responded as if the decline of gas prices were the more important event, significantly increasing purchases of premium gas.

Moreover, this behavior was prevalent: 61 percent of the households made at least one irrational gas purchase. People “treat changes in gasoline prices as equivalent to very large changes in income when deciding which grade of gasoline to purchase,” they wrote.

Economic models are simplifications. As in Jorge Luis Borges’s parable of a map that grew to be the same size as the empire it charted, there is no purpose in a model that captures all of the messy complexity of reality. Models are helpful because they leave things out. And patterns of irrational behavior are often dismissed as insignificant variations. Economists didn’t think people actually spent windfalls on exactly the things they wanted most. But they regarded the reality as close enough.

The kind of extensive and detailed data used by JPMorgan and the earlier study, however, are making it possible not only to see the complexity beneath the simplification, but also to aggregate all of those variations into a significantly different big picture.

A government devising a targeted tax cut, for example, would do well to remember that people are likely to spend the savings near the target.

And consumers would do well to remember that premium gas is usually a waste of money.","When Gas Becomes Cheaper, Americans Buy More Expensive Gas",2015-10-20,"Researchers also show that consumers use their savings to buy more gasoline, a tendency behavioral economists call “mental accounting.”",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/when-gas-becomes-cheaper-americans-buy-more-expensive-gas.html
923,"Pressured by low oil prices and costly wars in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia announced a sharp reduction in its 2016 budget on Monday to control a worsening deficit, which is steadily draining the kingdom’s financial reserves.

The official Saudi news media reported that the Finance Ministry would cut spending, adopt new taxes and reduce price subsidies for fuel, water and power.

The cost of some grades of domestic gasoline, among the first to be affected, could rise as much as 50 percent, a potentially unsettling spike in a country where mass transit does not exist and cars are a basic necessity.

The Saudi stock market fell 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday, with Saudi Basic Industries, the biggest petrochemical producer, tumbling 8.3 percent.

The price of oil, Saudi Arabia’s most important export, has tumbled this year because of reduced global demand and fierce competition by producers — including the Saudis — to keep their share of the market. The market is expected to be increasingly competitive because Iran could soon be free to sell its oil under relaxed international sanctions after Tehran’s nuclear agreement with world powers. In the summer of 2014, oil exceeded $100 a barrel, but it is now trading well below $40.

The falling price has benefited oil-consuming nations while putting severe financial pressure on exporters like Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela.

At the same time its revenue has slowed, Saudi Arabia has increased military spending, financing rebels in Syria and intervening in Yemen, where Saudi warplanes have been bombing the insurgent Houthi movement since March.

The Saudi kingdom has been spending more than it takes in, and by some estimates it could exhaust its foreign exchange reserves, now roughly $640 billion, by 2020 without deep cuts in spending, a big rise in the price of oil, or a combination of both.

The government ran a record deficit of about 367 billion riyals, or roughly $98 billion, in 2015, according to the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel. Under the 2016 budget, the goal is to reduce the deficit to 326 billion riyals, or about $87 billion.

The Finance Ministry projected the 2016 budget to be about 840 billion riyals, down from 975 billion riyals this year, Al Arabiya reported.

Analysts examining the budget said the Saudis were assuming that a barrel of oil would average about $45 in 2016. But some said even that projection was overly optimistic.

“They have less than five years to lose all their foreign currency reserves because of their major financial deficits, cost of military campaign in Yemen and their support to Syrian rebels,” said Luay Al-Khatteeb, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar, who specializes in the political economy of the Persian Gulf countries.

“Saudi Arabia must act fast and smart by starting to gradually cut down on their subsidies, reduce superfluous spending on defense and privatize selected state-owned entities to generate cash,” he said.","Saudi Arabia, Squeezed by Low Oil Prices, Cuts Spending to Shrink Deficit",2015-12-29,"The official Saudi news media reported that the Finance Ministry would cut spending, adopt new taxes and reduce price subsidies for fuel, water and power.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/world/middleeast/squeezed-by-low-oil-prices-saudi-arabia-cuts-spending-to-shrink-deficit.html
924,"WASHINGTON — Underlying inflation pressures in the United States rose in November, even as renewed weakness in gasoline prices kept overall consumer prices in check.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its so-called core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, gained 0.2 percent last month. It was the third straight month that the core consumer index increased by that much, and reflected rising rents and airline fares and higher costs for new motor vehicles and health care.

In the 12 months through November, the core C.P.I. rose 2 percent, the largest gain since May 2014, after rising 1.9 percent in October.

Inflation is also seen as heading higher in 2016 as the effects of last year’s sharp drop in oil prices fade. The dollar’s pace of appreciation is also expected to slow, which could ease some of the pressure on commodity prices.

Other data on Tuesday showed that factory activity in New York State contracted for a fifth straight month in December as the sector continues to reel from dollar strength and continuing efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bloat.

Last month’s increase in the core C.P.I. was offset by falling gasoline prices, leaving the overall index unchanged after a 0.2 percent increase in October. But in the 12 months through November, the index increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since last December.

Energy prices fell 1.3 percent last month. Gasoline prices dropped 2.4 percent, after rising 0.4 percent in October. The cost of electricity, however, increased 0.3 percent. Food prices dipped 0.1 percent, reversing the previous month’s gain.

Within the core C.P.I., rents increased 0.2 percent, after rising 0.3 percent in October. They were up 3.6 percent in the 12 months through November, reflecting rising demand for rental accommodation as more Americans shun homeownership.

Health care costs increased broadly; payments for doctor visits rose 1.1 percent. Apparel prices fell for a third straight month, while airline fares increased 1.2 percent. There were also increases in the cost of tobacco, education, communication and motor vehicle insurance.

“We think that the underlying strength of the domestic economy will continue to allow inflation rates to grind higher,” said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research in New York.","Core Inflation Ticks Up, Though Energy Prices Remain Low",2015-12-16,"The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its so-called core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, gained 0.2 percent last month, as it did in September and October.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/business/economy/core-inflation-rose-in-november.html
925,"WASHINGTON — Retail sales in the United States barely rose in September, and producer prices recorded their biggest decline in eight months, data released on Wednesday showed.

The weak reports were the latest suggestion that the economy was losing momentum in the face of slowing global growth, a strong dollar, an inventory correction and lower oil prices, which are hampering capital spending in the energy industry. Job growth braked sharply in the last two months.

The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month largely as cheaper gasoline pushed service station receipts down 3.2 percent. Giving the report a weak tone, sales in August were revised downward to show them unchanged instead of rising 0.2 percent.

Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services slipped 0.1 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in August.

These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously said to have advanced 0.4 percent in August.

Retail Sales Total retail and food services sales, seasonally adjusted. JULY +0.8% AUG. Unch. SEPT. +0.1% $450 billion 400 350 300 ’14 ’15

Last month’s weak core sales and the downward revision to August’s figure, together with another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories again unchanged in August, prompted JPMorgan to cut its estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product by half a percentage point, to an annual rate of 1 percent.

The economy grew at a 3.9 percent pace in the second quarter. Some economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the soft retail sales report, noting that discretionary spending remained fairly healthy.

Consumers bought more automobiles and furniture and spent more on hobbies, clothing and eating out. Those increases point to underlying strength in domestic demand, which should provide some cushion against softening global growth.

“The overall message is that consumer spending has remained extremely strong,” said Harm Bandholz, a chief economist at UniCredit Research.

Sales of electronic goods were soft despite the introduction of Apple’s latest iPhone.

A report from the Federal Reserve showed that the economy was expanding modestly from mid-August through early October. It described consumer spending as growing “moderately” during the same period and noted that the strong dollar was hurting manufacturing.

In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index fell 0.5 percent in September, the largest drop since January, after being unchanged in August.

Inventory-Sales Ratio Total month-end business inventories divided by total monthly business sales, seasonally adjusted. 1.38 1.34 1.30 1.26 ’14 ’15 Business inventories and sales Trillions of dollars, seasonally adjusted JULY AUG. INVENTORIES SALES $1.810 1.328 $1.811 1.320

In the 12 months through September, the index fell 1.1 percent after declining 0.8 percent in August. It was the eighth consecutive 12-month decrease in the index.

Weak inflation is one of the obstacles confronting Fed policy makers, who are contemplating raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since late 2008.

“It is the uncertain course of inflation that could keep the Fed from hiking rates this year,” said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.

Top Fed officials are divided on whether to tighten monetary policy, with Daniel K. Tarullo, a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, saying on Tuesday that the central bank should not increase rates this year.

The Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, have recently said they support raising rates this year.

HOUSTON — Exxon Mobil and Chevron reported plunging revenue and profits on Friday, but their fortunes would have been even worse had it not been for a boom in their refining and chemical businesses. Still, those gains were not enough to stanch further job losses at Chevron, which said it planned to cut up to 10 percent of its work force.

Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, reported a profit for the third quarter of $4.2 billion compared with $8.1 billion a year earlier. The plunge came with a 37 percent drop in revenue, in large part because of a 3 percent decline in United States production, including a 9 percent drop in natural gas output.

Chevron’s performance was even more disappointing, with net income of $2 billion compared with $5.6 billion last year, although it was the best quarter so far in what has been the toughest year for the American oil business in more than a decade.

The poor results came as no surprise given that oil prices have plummeted to under $50 a barrel from levels of more than $100 in the summer of 2014.

Natural gas prices have also slumped, although their drop has helped lower costs in the refining and chemical businesses that depend on the fuel for power and as a vital raw material. Stronger margins enabled Exxon Mobil to double the earnings of its refining and chemical businesses.

“Despite the challenging environment, the corporation continues to deliver on its investment and operating commitments,” Jeff Woodbury, Exxon Mobil’s vice president for investor relations, said in a conference call. “Third-quarter results reflect cyclical strength in our downstream and chemical segments and highlight the resilience of our integrated business model.”

Brian Youngberg, an Edward Jones analyst, said Exxon Mobil had a good quarter, but he added, “We believe earnings were better than anticipated at least partially due to a lower effective tax rate given its higher reliance on international results given the U.S. operations were collectively barely profitable overall.”

Chevron also reported big losses in the United States, and it announced on Friday that it intended to cut up to 7,000 jobs, or roughly 10 percent of its work force, in the coming months. That number includes a reduction of 1,500 employees announced earlier in the year.

The downturn in oil and gas prices is causing rising pains across the oil patch, especially for those companies that do not have refinery businesses. Oil companies are slashing payrolls, investments in exploration and payments to service companies. Most of the big companies say they are doing all they can to protect their dividends, though Marathon Oil cut its quarterly dividend this week to 5 cents a share from 21 cents a share.

Occidental Petroleum said this week that it was selling off its assets in North Dakota’s Bakken shale field, a crown jewel of the hydraulic fracturing revolution only two years ago, for $600 million. ConocoPhillips announced that it would stop exploration in deepwater offshore fields by 2017 because of the high costs of such operations, while it sells offshore leases, to free $800 million in capital. ConocoPhillips, which is based in Houston, reported a loss for the quarter of $1.1 billion compared with its profit of $2.7 billion in the quarter a year ago.

“Growth will not be rewarded in this environment,” Al Walker, Anadarko Petroleum’s chief executive, said this week during a conference call. The company has already sold $2 billion in assets since the oil slump began and written off $2.6 billion on the value of its oil assets.

Several top oil executives in recent days expressed little hope that the price of oil and their businesses would rebound briskly any time soon. “We’ve taken aggressive action for a downturn that could last longer than many market participants expect,” said Stephen Chazen, Occidental’s chief executive.

The biggest fear among energy experts is that a global recession in 2016 could prolong the current glut.

There are other analysts, however, who see a stabilization and rise in oil prices by the end of 2016, even though many concede that prices could still drop further over the next few months. The Pira Energy Group, a consultancy based in New York, released a report this week predicting a growing demand on global petroleum inventories that could ease the glut.

“Global oil demand growth is strong, especially in China, India and the industrialized countries, and will remain so in 2016,” Pira said. Reporting that production capacity constraints are limiting OPEC output and that production in major producing countries outside the cartel is also declining, the report concluded, “Supply growth is quickly eroding.”

There is much anticipation that the Iran nuclear deal will bring an additional 500,000 barrels or more to the 94-million-barrel-a-day market by late 2016. But at the same time, exports from Libya remain constrained, and violence in Iraq and elsewhere across the Middle East and North Africa is threatening production.

Most significant, perhaps, are signs that Saudi Arabian exports are beginning to ease after a year in which the country has been producing at full tilt to defend its market share in Asia. With refineries increasing production to meet rising domestic needs, Saudi crude exports appear to have peaked in August, oil experts say, and there is little or no more spare capacity to produce more.

There are persistent reports in energy circles that Saudi Arabia would like to come to some agreement with Russia and other major producers to bring the global market into balance — as long as it does not mean that Saudi Arabia alone cuts production, as happened with disastrous economic results in the 1980s.

“If Russia and OPEC can arrive at an understanding in regards to oil production,” said Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive with Saudi Aramco, “it might attract a broader dialogue with others such as Brazil and Mexico and help U.S. and other O.E.C.D. producers,” referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",Chevron and Exxon Post Declining 3rd-Quarter Results,2015-10-31,Exxon Mobil reports a 37 percent drop in revenue and Chevron says it plans to cut up to 10 percent of its workforce.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/business/energy-environment/exxon-chevron-q3-earnings-oil-prices.html

LONDON — Oil prices hit 11-year lows in Asia and Europe on Monday, as a glut of crude on world markets and the recent global climate accord continue to depress fossil-fuel prices.

Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, settled at $36.51 a barrel on Monday in Europe.

Analysts say there is little to restrain continued price declines in the near term. Prices are down about 15 percent so far in December, after an OPEC meeting failed to produce measures to restrain record-high production. That meeting was quickly followed by the United Nations climate accord in Paris, which aims to reduce the world’s reliance on oil and other carbon-emitting fuels.

The latest factor weighing on prices has been unusually warm weather in the United States and Europe, which is reducing winter demand for heating oil and leading to rising stockpiles of oil products. The expectation that the American government may soon lift a decades-old ban on exports of crude from the United States may also be affecting prices.

What’s the Current Price of Oil? Brent crude, the main international benchmark, was trading around $ a barrel on . The American benchmark was at around $ a barrel. This is why oil prices have dropped so much since 2014.

“We are probably going to see the weakness run at least through January,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm.

Analysts say that crude oil prices are likely to remain under pressure in the spring, when refineries typically shut down for maintenance, weakening demand.

While few analysts had expected OPEC to decide to cut production when the group met in Vienna this month, the signals from the meeting appeared to show that the cartel, which accounts for about 30 percent of world oil production, was not even close to coming up with a plan to try to manage the market.

“Even compared to the low expectations, the meeting sent out negative signals,” Mr. Mallinson said. “There was no unity and nothing that looked like the basis for more coherence next year.”

While disgruntled OPEC members like Venezuela muttered about the “catastrophe” caused by rock-bottom oil revenues, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other gulf countries are expected to continue to produce at or near record levels, and new supplies are expected from Iran, assuming international sanctions are lifted next year.

Analysts say that Saudi Arabia’s strategy of keeping production high to maintain market share and weaken higher-cost producers is showing some signs of working. For instance, the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based monitoring organization, forecasts that supplies from outside of OPEC will decline next year.

Still, those prospects have not been enough to shore up prices. Production in the United States remains strong, as higher production from projects in the Gulf of Mexico offsets declines in shale oil production on shore, where low prices have discouraged some energy companies from investing in new drilling. Russia, meanwhile, is essentially shrugging off the impact of Western sanctions over Ukraine and is still producing at high levels.

In a recent report, the International Energy Agency said it expected global inventories to keep growing at least until late 2016, although at a much slower pace than this year. “As inventories continue to swell into 2016, there will still be a lot of oil weighing on the market,” the agency said.",Oil Prices Slump to 11-Year Lows in Asia and Europe,2015-12-22,"A glut of crude and the recent United Nations climate accord have both weighed on the market, factors exacerbated by OPEC’s keeping production high.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-opec.html

After watching the price of oil and the size of their profits plunge, a dozen top executives from some of the nation’s largest oil exploration companies flew to Washington late last winter on an urgent mission: push Congress and the White House to allow unlimited exports of American crude oil.

Now, their long-shot lobbying effort to repeal the 40-year-old export ban has gathered considerable momentum. Approval by the House is expected in the coming weeks, and two Senate committees have already endorsed the idea.

The White House and Senate Democrats may still move to block it, but the fact that the legislation is even moving ahead in an era of extreme gridlock affirms the deep-pocketed oil industry’s durable power in nation’s capital.

“The sooner this happens, the better for us,” said Kenneth P. Cohen, Exxon Mobil’s vice president for public and governmental affairs. “The momentum has picked up. The political calculus right now is very favorable for taking a look and actually doing something about this ban.”

To industry executives, the swift progress validates the inherent strength of their argument that eliminating the export ban will create jobs and drive down gasoline prices by encouraging more domestic crude oil production.

To that end, the oil industry has financed organizations whose scholars have generated reports praising the proposal. It has placed op-eds in Capitol Hill newspapers and paid for television spots in key markets, including one round of new ads introduced last week naming a dozen Democratic House members the industry is trying to pressure to back the measure.

Industry executives have even pressed foreign governments to communicate their support through “diplomatic channels.” And they have enlisted help from lawmakers from major oil-producing states, including Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas; Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota; and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. These lawmakers alone have also benefited from more than $3 million combined in direct industry campaign contributions during their careers.

Louis A. Finkel, the top lobbyist at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, calls the effort a “campaign-style engagement,” more akin to a presidential campaign.

The institute has an annual budget of about $235 million and it spends about $70 million of that on television commercials, social media posts and other advertising. A sizable chunk of the blitz this year is aimed at pushing Congress to lift the export ban.

That spending has helped build oil industry programs with names like “Energy Nation” and “Energy Citizens” — networks of millions of oil industry employees and supporters who are directed to send out tens of thousands of emails, Twitter messages (#LiftTheBan) and other appeals to create the appearance of a national consensus.

For opponents of the legislation, the wave of advocacy has been difficult to challenge.

“They are saturating Washington on this issue and defining it on their own terms,” said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, a nonprofit group that has tried to raise objections to the repeal of the ban.

The export ban has been a cornerstone of American energy policy since 1975, when Congress directed President Gerald R. Ford to largely prohibit the export of oil as “consistent with the national interest,” although a few broad exemptions, like exports to Canada, were allowed.

But the calculus has changed since domestic oil production nearly doubled after 2008 because of the sharp increase in drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale fields across the United States, slashing the country’s dependence on imports from OPEC and producing a glut of several types of crude oil.

In the last two years, the Obama administration has made modest adjustments to the ban, including giving oil companies temporary permission to swap varieties of oil with Mexico. But the industry wants a full reversal, hoping it will offer relief from the glut and price collapse, which is causing intense financial strain.

Think tanks have been a critical part of the repeal effort, with prominent centers like the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute issuing reports or sending scholars to Capitol Hill endorsing the move. These same organizations have taken large donations — in some instances exceeding $1 million a year, as was the case for Brookings — in combined contributions from industry donors.

Thomas J. Duesterberg, co-author of one Aspen Institute report — funded in part by the American Petroleum Institute, ConocoPhillips, Continental Resources, Exxon Mobil and Pioneer Natural Resources — concluded that repealing the ban would create about 630,000 jobs within five years. He said the industry funding had no impact on his findings. But it was obvious to him why the industry helped finance his project.

“Part of the way you make an argument these days, is to provide some solid economic grounding for your arguments,” Mr. Duesterberg said.",Oil Industry Gaining in Push for Repeal of U.S. Ban on Petroleum Exports,2015-10-06,"A well-coordinated and well-financed campaign to win repeal of the 40-year-old ban on oil exports, once thought a long shot, is gaining momentum.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/energy-environment/oil-industry-gaining-in-push-for-repeal-of-us-ban-on-petroleum-exports.html
929,"“The apparent weakness in the Chinese economy is radiating out into the world,” said Daniel Yergin, the vice chairman of IHS, a leading provider of market information, and the author of two seminal books on the history of the oil industry, “The Prize” and “The Quest.”

“An awful lot of producers who enjoyed good times were more dependent on Chinese economic growth than they recognized,” Mr. Yergin said. “This is an oil shock.”

Although the price drop has most directly hurt oil exporters, it also may signal a new period of global economic fragility that could hurt all countries — an anxiety that already has been evident in the gyrating stock markets.

The price drop also has become an indirect element in the course of Syria’s civil war and other points of global tension. Countries that once could use their oil wealth as leverage, like Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, may no longer have as much influence, some political analysts said. Iran, which once asserted it could withstand the antinuclear embargo of its oil by the West, appeared to have rethought that calculation in reaching an agreement on its nuclear activities last month.

Of course, lower oil prices confer economic benefits, too. The average American household, for instance, buys 1,200 gallons of gasoline every year. And gasoline, on average, has sold for most of this year by roughly a dollar a gallon less than in 2014.

But even while lower oil prices stimulate economies of consuming countries, a protracted decline carries many unanticipated consequences — starting with the economic weakness in developing countries that buy increasing amounts of goods from the United States and others in the industrialized world.

A supply glut has been evident for some time, driven partly by a vast increase in Saudi production and a growing energy self-sufficiency in the United States, which was once heavily reliant on Middle East oil.

Saudi Arabia not only is producing a record amount, but also is increasing the number of rigs drilling for future production. And its Gulf allies, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, are following suit. Even with the turmoil wrought by the Islamic State, Iraq’s production has jumped nearly 20 percent since the beginning of the year.

The surge in production may seem counterintuitive, since lower prices can cause self-inflicted economic wounds and potentially incite more political and social trouble. But all the exporters in the Middle East are struggling with each other to protect Asian markets, now that the United States is using much less of their oil.

The Gulf states, said Sadad I. Al-Husseini, former executive vice president of the Saudi Aramco oil company, “don’t want to take on the role of oil price regulators because the market is far too big and too political for them to manage it.”

Had these producers curtailed their production late last year, he said, “a flood of new oil supplies from the U.S., Canada, the deep offshore and other basins would have continued to undermine the oil markets, and prices would have collapsed to where they are now in any case.”

The global glut is likely to worsen if the nuclear deal with Iran is approved, potentially releasing as much as one million more barrels onto the 94-million-barrel-a-day global market in a year or so.

Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, has made no secret about his country’s intentions. “We will be raising our oil production at any cost, and we have no other alternative,” he was quoted Sunday in Iran’s state-run news media as saying.

The big change in recent years has been the surge of United States oil production, adding more than four million barrels a day to global supplies. But in recent months the oversupply has been driven primarily by the Saudis, who have flooded the market in what economists regard as a deliberate attempt to drive down the price so that other high-cost producers can no longer compete — most notably the Americans.

Still, production in the United States has not declined as much as foreseen by the Saudis, who thought the price of oil would stabilize at about $50 a barrel. Now it may be headed to $30, the lowest level since the 2008 global economic recession.

The Saudis, the most important member of OPEC, have resisted calls by other members to reduce output. The result is that nearly all OPEC members, who together control much less of the global market than they once did, are pumping more oil.

“We are witnessing competition between member states over market share, and most of these countries are dependent on oil as a primary source of income,” said Luay Al-Khatteeb, a nonresident fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Doha Center. If prices do not recover to the $60 a barrel level, he said, “and countries in the Arab region continue to rely on oil revenue heavily, we could see decades of decline.”

David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration, said that if the Brent global oil benchmark price stays below $45 a barrel, that is “a red flag for stability issues across the oil producing world.”

“The hemorrhaging of government budgets reliant on oil will force dramatic cuts in spending or dangerous increases in borrowing, if not both,” Mr. Goldwyn said. “The countries without significant foreign exchange reserves are most at risk, and they include Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Venezuela and Iraq. The countries which need to sustain investment to maintain political legitimacy need to be worried, and that’s Brazil, Russia and even Iran.”

Meghan L. O’Sullivan, director of the Geopolitics of Energy program at Harvard’s Kennedy School, said she was most immediately concerned about the impact of extended low oil prices on Iraq.

“Not only is fighting ISIS an expensive endeavor, but many of the political deals that need to be done to keep different groups supportive of the Iraqi government require money to sustain,” she said.

But Ms. O’Sullivan expressed a longer-term worry about possible miscalculations by Saudi Arabia, on both the duration and magnitude of the oil price drop.

“With a burgeoning population looking for jobs, education and health care every day,” she said, “the expensive social contract between the royal family and Saudi citizens will get more difficult, and eventually impossible, to sustain if oil prices do not recover.”","From Venezuela to Iraq to Russia, Oil Price Drops Raise Fears of Unrest",2015-08-25,The downward spiral of oil prices and the reluctance to reduce production are threatening to destabilize economies and governments in many places that are already fragile.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/world/from-venezuela-to-iraq-to-russia-oil-price-drops-raise-fears-of-unrest.html

959,"HOUSTON — After three days of spiking oil prices, a barrel of crude tumbled back nearly 8 percent on Tuesday, renewing despair in the oil patch. At the same time, ConocoPhillips announced it was cutting its global work force by 10 percent.

The two events were not directly linked, but they combined to reinforce the widespread notion around the oil fields and corporate headquarters in cities like Houston and Oklahoma City that the declining fortunes of the industry will not reverse anytime soon.

“Our industry is undergoing a dramatic downturn,” Daren Beaudo, a ConocoPhillips spokesman, said in an email statement. “As we have assessed the implications of lower prices on our business, we’ve made the difficult decision that work force reductions will be necessary.”

The company will cut 1,800 employees, most of them in North America. More than 500 of ConocoPhillips’s 3,750 employees in Houston, the company’s base, will be cut, and another 400 will lose their jobs in Canada. The company had already cut 1,000 jobs this year.

The job cuts are part of a general restructuring that includes reductions in future deepwater exploration.

Before the ConocoPhillips announcement, at least 176,000 oil workers had lost their jobs globally since 2014, according to Swift Worldwide Resources, an oil and gas recruitment agency.

There have been a scattering of bankruptcies in the industry, and a growing number of companies have already suspended their dividends or sold off assets at bargain-basement prices to pay interest on their debts.

Oil markets have been whipsawed in recent days by contradictory reports.

On Monday, a commentary accompanying an OPEC market report suggested that the cartel was willing to sit down with non-OPEC producers to shore up prices. With Venezuela already talking to Russia about how to stabilize the market, some traders concluded that perhaps Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies were rethinking their strategy of pumping more oil even as prices were falling.

At the same time, data released by the Energy Department this week showed that domestic oil production may have peaked at 9.6 million barrels a day in April and has since fallen by more than 300,000 barrels a day. If that trend were to continue, a drop of as much as a million barrels a day of American production could come off the global market by late next year, relieving the current glut.

But on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a large rise in domestic crude stocks. With the summer driving season drawing to a close and refineries preparing to shut down for maintenance, those inventories can be expected to build, and prices typically decline when they do.

Wall Street analysts treated the recent spike in oil prices — which surpassed 20 percent over the three trading days from last Thursday through Monday — with caution if not derision.

Several warned that there was no sign that Saudi Arabia was about to cut production, and said that traders were being motivated more by fear than reasonable analysis.

“Sharp gains over the past three trading sessions were driven by a combination of short covering and chart readers again looking to call a bottom falsely,” according to a Citi Research investment note this week.

The American benchmark price for oil dropped 7.7 percent, to $45.41 a barrel on Tuesday. The global benchmark fell 8.5 percent, to $49.56 a barrel. Both are less than half the levels of last summer.

Many analysts say that the price of crude could drop another $10 in the short term, especially if the Chinese economy continues to slow. That would be good for consumers, who could see the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline decline to $2 in many parts of the country over the next few months.

But at current prices, the glut is probably not sustainable. Much of the oil produced around the world is no longer profitable — particularly in the Canadian oil sands and deepwater fields around the Western Hemisphere and Africa.

Already, companies are dropping their investments in long-range projects, and recent auctions for offshore fields held in Mexico and the United States have attracted little interest.

A sharp drop in drilling in American shale fields has not led to a significant reduction in production. But that is likely to change in the coming months, since the productivity of the typical shale oil well declines by more than 60 percent after its first year in production.",Price of Crude Oil Tumbles After Soaring for 3 Days,2015-09-02,"As benchmark crude fell by nearly 8 percent, ConocoPhillips said it was cutting its global work force by 10 percent, or 1,800 jobs.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/business/energy-environment/oil-tumbles-as-wild-ride-continues.html

973,"SYDNEY, Australia — Oil Search, a Papua New Guinea natural gas producer, rejected an $8 billion all-stock takeover bid by the Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum on Monday, saying that the proposed deal was “highly opportunistic and grossly undervalues the company.”

Oil and gas bankers, however, expect Woodside to make another offer for Oil Search. Woodside is searching for high quality oil and gas assets after abandoning plans last year to buy part of a large natural gas discovery offshore from Israel after a year of talks.

That Woodside is currently paying out 80 percent of its underlying profit in dividends to shareholders “is a signal that material growth could be some way off,” said Nik Burns, an analyst with UBS in Melbourne.

Oil Search has a 29 percent stake in a liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, operated by ExxonMobil, as well as stakes in other proposed LNG projects in the country that was once a colony of Australia until independence in 1975.

Woodside offered one of its shares for every four Oil Search shares, the equivalent of 7.65 Australian dollars a share, according to UBS. Some bankers said that if Woodside made another bid for Oil Search it would offer a cash alternative of as much as 9 Australian dollars a share.

“It’s not surprising the Woodside bid has been rejected in the first instance as it’s now a typical value dance,” said Alex Cartel, a managing director and head of Australian energy investment banking at Deutsche Bank. “In the current oil and gas environment, attempting to use stock is logical given that the oil price assumptions that would need to underpin a cash bid are inherently risky at present.”

For its part, Oil Search is not for sale, said a person who is advising the company but wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak on the record.

Investors remained focused on what the world’s central banks plan to do at their coming policy meetings.

The consensus among investors was that the Fed would raise rates at its meeting on Dec. 15 and 16. That view was reinforced on Wednesday, when the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, indicated that the American economy was on track for an interest rate increase this month, though she was careful to point out that the Fed would need to review any coming data before making a decision.

Government bond prices fell after Ms. Yellen’s comments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.18 percent from 2.15 percent.

The data Ms. Yellen was referring to include the November jobs report, which comes out on Friday. Economists forecast that employers created 200,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate remained steady at 5 percent.

“It’s becoming more and more likely that the Fed is going to raise rates,” said Kristina Hooper, head of United States investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors.

Unless the November employment figures are extraordinarily weak, investors believe the Fed will raise interest rates this month, from record low levels, for the first time since the financial crisis. Some preliminary jobs data out on Wednesday supported the forecast that the American jobs market continued to improve last month. The payroll processor ADP said the private sector created 217,000 jobs in November.

In Europe, investors expected the European Central Bank to move in the opposite direction and expand its stimulus program when policy makers meet on Thursday, either by expanding its bond purchases or by cutting interest rates further. Mario Draghi, the bank’s president, signaled that the action was coming this week as the E.C.B. seeks to support growth and push inflation higher.

The dollar strengthened to 123.22 yen from 122.84 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0613 from $1.0630.

LONDON — Ten of the world’s big oil companies, mainly from Europe, jointly acknowledged on Friday that their industry must help address global climate change and said that they agreed with the United Nations’ goals of limiting global warming.

The public declaration by a group called the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative was an effort to convince an increasingly skeptical world that energy companies, whose fossil fuels are a big source of greenhouse gases, are serious about delivering cleaner energy and combating climate change.

But the impact of that statement might be limited.

None of the biggest American oil companies signed the declaration or were part of the group. The companies that were involved — including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Saudi Aramco and Total — made no specific commitments toward helping to meet the climate challenge. Instead, they indicated they would await government regulations to chart the way forward.

Eight of the chief executives in the group discussed its aims at a news conference on Friday in Paris, looking ahead to the United Nations climate conference Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 in the French capital.

Robert Dudley, an American who is chief executive of BP, the oil company based in London, expressed optimism on Friday, despite the lack of participation by companies from the United States. “I think we can make the difference,” Mr. Dudley, who is chairman of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, told reporters in Paris. “Almost every company here has large investments in the United States.”

The companies in the oil group said they would support the climate conference’s effort to reach a global climate change agreement at the Paris conference. They specifically cited the United Nations’ target of staving off a rise in the atmospheric temperature of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius).

By recognizing that goal, the executives are putting themselves in a tricky position. Meeting that target would require leaving much of the world’s existing oil, gas and coal reserves unburned and would require the companies to make major changes in the way they do business.

Many experts, including people in the oil industry, doubt that the goal can be met.

The executives acknowledged that “the existing trend of the world’s net global greenhouse gas emissions is not consistent with this ambition.” In other words, the world’s factories and vehicles are still pumping out far too much carbon dioxide.

But the executives, who said their companies provided nearly 10 percent of the world’s energy, did not commit to any new limits on their own activities. Instead, they left it up to governments to establish regulations and other measures that would encourage them “to take informed decisions and make effective and sustainable contributions to addressing climate change.”

Neil Beveridge, an oil analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the industry deserved credit at least for acknowledging its role in climate change. “It is a big, big step for such a large number of companies to gather,” he said. “Over the years, a lot of companies have been in denial on this issue.”

But Anthony Hobley, chief executive of Carbon Tracker, a London organization that advises on the risks of investing in energy companies, noted the limits of Friday’s statement. “There was no commitment to get out ahead of government,” he said.

American giants like Chevron and ExxonMobil are among those that appear to disapprove of the European-led initiative, partly because the potential remedies — like carbon taxes or the trading of carbon-emission permits — that many experts say are necessary to curb greenhouse gases would almost inevitably raise the price of their fuels.

“I’ve never had a customer come to me and ask to pay a higher price for oil, gas or other products,” John S. Watson, the chief executive of Chevron, told a meeting hosted in June in Vienna by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Rex W. Tillerson, ExxonMobil’s chief executive, has repeatedly said that he would support putting a price on carbon as long as it was “revenue neutral.”

An explicit call for putting a high price on carbon emissions was deliberately omitted from Friday’s declaration. Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of the Italian oil company Eni, and a participant in the group, said in an interview on Friday that most of his European colleagues agreed that some form of carbon levy would eventually be essential.

“Carbon pricing is the only way to have a reasonable energy mix” to sustain the 3.6-degree ceiling, he said. But he said Friday’s declaration used less-specific language to bring some of the international companies on board. “Now we are trying to create a consensus,” he said.

The other members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative are Statoil of Norway; Repsol of Spain; the Mexican company Pemex; the Indian company Reliance Industries; and the BG Group of Britain.

The United Nations goal of limiting global warming to about 3.6 degrees is based on a comparison to temperatures in the preindustrial 19th century. That level of warming, although potentially producing dire effects on agriculture, sea level and the natural world, could stave off the most severe impacts of drought, food and water shortages, and widespread flooding — events that could profoundly harm the world’s population and economy.

But to achieve that limit would require severe reductions in carbon emissions by 2050.

The companies’ statement on Friday included a list of ways they said they would collaborate to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions. Those included cleaning up their own operations and reducing methane emissions that escape from oil and gas installations.

“Technologies can deliver the solutions for the future,” Patrick Pouyanné, Total’s chief executive, said in Paris on Friday. “On this climate change, we prefer to collaborate rather than to compete.”

The companies also said they would work with automakers and consumers to improve vehicle fuel economy. Big on the companies’ agenda, too, are efforts to give natural gas a bigger share of the global energy mix.

Of the group, Shell and Total in particular have invested heavily in natural-gas-related businesses in recent years. They portray natural gas as a fossil fuel that produces fewer carbon emissions than oil — and much less than coal, which is dirtier and often cheaper than natural gas.

978,"A resurgent energy sector and another big acquisition by Warren E. Buffett propelled the stock market to its best session in three months on Monday.

Energy stocks rose, following the price of oil. Crude rebounded after dropping to its lowest level of the year in early trading. Industrial stocks also climbed sharply after Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett’s company, agreed to buy Precision Castparts, a maker of industrial components, for $37.2 billion.

The pace of corporate deal-making has been surging this year as borrowing costs have stayed low, making it easier for companies to pay for acquisitions. That tends to push up stock prices because buyers typically pay a premium to make the deal attractive to shareholders.

The gains also ended a seven-session losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average, its longest run of losses in four years. Some mixed earnings reports and the decline in oil have weighed on the 30-member index in the last three weeks.

Some investors are also anticipating that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates next month.

Precision Castparts was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. Energy stocks were also among the biggest gainers as oil rose, rebounding from heavy losses last week. The sector jumped 3 percent as shares of companies including Exxon Mobil and Chevron climbed.

The price of oil posted a strong gain after briefly dipping below its lowest close for the year. United States crude climbed $1.09 to settle at $44.96 a barrel in New York. Early Monday, oil dipped a penny below its $43.46 March 17 close, its lowest in six years. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many United States refineries, rose $1.80 to settle at $50.41 in London.

Despite Monday’s rebound, oil is still down almost 60 percent from its peak last year.

About 90 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 have reported their second-quarter results, and average earnings for companies in the index are flat for the period. However, that’s masking a big decline in energy company earnings. If the energy sector is excluded, profits rose 7.7 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ data.

HOUSTON — Despite the recent tumult in global stock and energy markets, American travelers can count on bargains at the pump this Labor Day weekend, with prices for gasoline at their lowest levels in 11 years.

With oil prices diving by more than 50 percent since last summer, the low prices are no surprise, analysts say. But the numbers can be startling to any driver who habitually glances at the gasoline price billboards along the highway.

On Friday, the national average for regular gasoline was $2.42 a gallon, 9 cents lower than only a week ago and $1.01 lower than last year, according to the AAA motor club.

“Consumers will feel a lot better at the pump this holiday than they will looking at their 401(k)’s,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.

All told, Mr. Kloza estimated that Thursday through Monday, Americans would spend $3.9 billion on fuel, down from $5.5 billion during the holiday weekend in 2014 and 2013.

Behind the low gasoline prices are widespread fears that the global economy is slowing, along with a resilient expansion of domestic oil production. The prices represent an astonishing reversal from recent years, when motorists complained bitterly about gas expenses.

An estimated 8,250 gas stations in 24 states — representing more than 5 percent of the nation’s stations — now have prices below $2 a gallon. Not a single station in the country sold gas at that price last Labor Day weekend, specialists say.

“Average U.S. gas prices are falling at the fastest rates since December,” said Michael Green, a spokesman for AAA, referring to the month after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shocked oil traders by refusing to cut production and allowing crude prices to collapse.

Several AAA clubs project that 35.5 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more over the weekend, the highest volume since 2008 and a 1 percent increase from last year. The AAA clubs say 86 percent of the travelers will drive.

Cheap gasoline is encouraging motorists to drive more. The Federal Highway Administration has reported that the mileage driven in the first half of the year was the highest since 2008, before the recession. In July, drivers traveled 266.8 billion miles, a 1.5 percent increase from last year, when prices exceeded $100 a barrel and gasoline prices were roughly a dollar a gallon higher.

Today, global oil benchmark prices are hovering around $45 to $50 a barrel, although in recent days they have been on a particularly wild ride, jumping or falling 5 percent or more, sometimes within hours.

Last summer, oil and gasoline prices jumped as turmoil rocked the Middle East. But Iraq kept pumping and exporting, as have Saudi Arabia and other gulf states. Meanwhile production in the United States has remained high as producers have become more efficient.

And after the recent nuclear deal, the prospect of Iran exporting large amounts of oil again has worried traders and energy executives that a glut could last years.

But drivers have not saved as much this summer as they might have expected.

Typically, according to AAA, gas prices drop 2.4 cents a gallon for every $1 a barrel drop in crude price. But this summer the savings have been less than 2 cents a gallon largely because of refinery mishaps. An explosion in February at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Torrance, Calif., was so severe the plant is still not operating at full capacity.

And last month, BP’s refinery in Whiting, Ind., the largest in the Midwest, was forced to shut down its biggest crude distillation unit for several days because of leaky pipes. That sent gasoline prices soaring across the Great Lakes region, and some energy specialists warned that high prices could last more than a month.

But technicians fixed the problem sooner than expected, and the national average for a regular gallon of gasoline has dropped every day for more than two weeks, in time for the holiday weekend.

Prices are bound to decline more as the busy summer driving season ends and refineries process cheaper winter blends.

“September looks like another month that consumers will save about $60 at the pump versus last year,” Mr. Kloza said. He estimated that the average driver puts 60 gallons a month into his or her gas tank.

The Energy Department recently predicted that the average national price for regular gasoline would decline to $2.11 in the fourth quarter, contributing to an annual average of $2.41 for 2015. That is roughly a dollar lower than last year.

The one wild card for prices is, as always, the price of crude oil, which can jump in the event of a crisis in the Middle East. But at the moment, commodity traders are more fearful of a decline in global demand mostly because of the slower economic growth in China.

“A slowdown in China means more than just a slowdown in Chinese oil demand,” according to a Barclays report on Friday. “China’s industrial activity and global links, the energy intensity of its commodity imports, and even the oil used to get these goods to the country will all stumble if China does.”","For Labor Day Drivers, Lowest Gasoline Prices in 11 Years",2015-09-05,"The national average price for regular gas was $2.42 a gallon on Friday, 9 cents less than a week ago and $1.01 less than last year, the AAA motor club said.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/business/energy-environment/shrugging-off-market-turmoil-gas-prices-extend-slide.html
980,"HOUSTON — — After a summer of lower gasoline prices, American consumers will again spend considerably less on energy this winter because of lower oil and natural gas prices and expected warmer weather, the Energy Department projected on Tuesday.

The nearly half of American households that are heated with natural gas can expect a decline of 10 percent in their gas spending, the agency said. The department’s Energy Information Administration, in its Winter Fuels Outlook report, forecast a 6 percent decline in residential natural gas consumption this winter because of higher temperatures, while prices will be 4 percent lower than they were last winter.

An even bigger savings will go to homes that rely on heating oil, mostly in the Northeast, with households saving 25 percent. Retail prices are expected to be 15 percent lower, while consumption is expected to be 11 percent lower. The average household could pay roughly $460 less than last winter.

Propane users, mostly in rural areas and in the Midwest, are expected to spend 21 percent less this winter than last. Total electricity expenditures are expected to be 3 percent lower than last winter.

“If winter temperatures come in as expected by U.S. government weather forecasters, U.S. consumers will pay less to stay warm this winter no matter what heating fuel they use,” Adam Sieminski, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, said in a statement.

Driving will also continue to be cheaper, Mr. Sieminski said. “December’s expected national average gasoline price of $2.03 a gallon would be the lowest average retail price for the month in seven years,” he said.

Lower energy prices should be particularly helpful to working-class families who spend a high proportion of their incomes on fuels. Much of their additional spending power should help restaurants and retailers. Many industries, including airlines and manufacturers of petrochemicals, chemicals and plastics, should also benefit from the lower energy costs.

While global oil prices have made a modest rebound in recent days, the major factor in the slide in energy costs is the collapse of crude prices since summer 2014 to about $50 a barrel from more than $100 a barrel. Meanwhile the continuing increase in domestic natural gas production has also meant lower prices, and inventories are expected to be at record levels at the start of the heating season.

Rates for households using natural gas would be even lower — reflecting the projected average 13 percent decline in natural gas prices since last winter — except for the fact that utility rates for natural gas are often set by state utility commissions a year or more before the season. Also residential rates include utility operating and transport costs, which frequently rise from year to year.

The picture for natural gas consumers in the Northeast may not be totally favorable, especially if the winter is colder than expected, because natural gas pipeline capacity is still limited in New England and New York. The situation has improved somewhat with capacity added in the last year or two from the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania to the New York market.",Energy Department Predicts Lower Winter Fuel Bills,2015-10-07,"Natural gas, oil and propane users can expect savings because of lower prices and warmer weather, the Energy Department predicts.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/business/energy-environment/energy-department-predicts-lower-winter-fuel-bills.html

982,"It has been a frantic week on Wall Street and in other financial centers, with stocks and other risky assets experiencing their worst week in years.

The 3.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index on Friday culminated the worst week for United States stocks since 2011, and put the index 7.5 percent below its recent peak on May 21. Many global markets have performed even worse, with stocks down across Asia and Europe. And the price of oil and emerging market currencies around the world continued a decline that dates to last year.

It’s about time.

That’s not to minimize the losses investors have incurred, or to say that each of these moves can be completely justified by data, and certainly not to predict what will happen next week or next month. But if you step back just a bit, what has happened in financial markets this week looks less like a catastrophe in the making and more like a much-needed breather when various markets had been starting to look a little bubbly.

Market commentators offer a range of specific explanations for the sell-off, including a drop in oil prices thanks to a global supply glut (which will affect the profits of energy companies and oil-dependent emerging markets alike), a slowdown in the Chinese economy that is becoming more apparent by the day, and a credit squeeze in other emerging markets. But those explanations, while accurate, are part of a bigger story.

Markets have been priced for perfection, and we’re getting some reminders that the world economy is far from perfect.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The United States stock market, as measured by the S.&P. 500, is the clearest example. It fell 5.8 percent this week and is now down 4 percent for the year. But that only pulls the index down to October 2014 levels. Against a longer time horizon, the recent drop looks more like a trivial downward bounce within a consistent range rather than something more dire.

Flat stock prices in 2015 mask what came before: a remarkable run-up in stock prices in the preceding half-decade. From mid-2009 to mid-2014, stock prices rose much faster than corporate earnings, or gross domestic product, or pretty much anything else you might think of as fundamentals.

Investors Receive Little Compensation for Risk Stock investors are receiving relatively low earnings relative to the prices they pay. Earnings yield of S.&P. 500 % 7.0 6.5 6.0 5.5 5.0 5.6% 2013 2014 2015 Earnings yield of S.&P. 500 % 7.0 6.5 6.0 5.5 5.0 5.6% 2013 2014 2015

In effect, investors became more and more willing to take the risk inherent in owning stocks, so much so that they were willing to pay very high prices for shares relative to the profits of the companies they were buying a piece of. Thus, by definition, they were accepting low returns (low by absolute standards and relative to the very low interest rates offered on safer investments like government bonds).

Just over three years ago, in July 2012, investing $100 in the S.&P. 500 captured more than $7 in annual earnings; putting the same money in a 10 year United States Treasury bond paid out only $1.55.

In other words, stocks might have been risky, but investors were being compensated nicely for that risk.

What do those numbers look like now? Even after the sell-off in stocks this week, the same $100 invested in stocks buys only $5.59 in earnings, compared with $2.08 for Treasury bonds. The fact that investors aren’t being compensated very much for taking on risk is, quite logically, making them more skittish when those risks materialize.

Stocks Have Been Flat in 2015 Even after a steep drop this week, stocks are down only about 2 percent for the year as of midday Friday.

A mix of interventionist policies from the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and a global glut of investment capital have created a mismatch between the global economy, which has grown glacially, and markets, which have been on fire.

As Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management tweeted on Friday, “2015 is the first year since the recovery began where the real economy is outperforming the financial economy.”

The big question now is whether the fundamentals driving the recent sell-off — the oil glut, the emerging market strains — get worse or better. That matters a lot for businesses and individuals in China and other countries under stress, and for oil producers globally. But for the United States economy and even for most companies traded on American exchanges, it’s much less clear that it should create a major hit.

Consider that in 1997 and 1998, an emerging markets crisis rippled across East Asia and Russia. It turned out that 1999 was a blockbuster year for United States economic growth and corporate earnings anyway.

In the meantime, the best response for most investors trying to grapple with the latest bout of volatility is to take a deep breath, appreciate the remarkable run-up of the last five years, and remember that if you panic at the thought of losing 6 percent of your money in a week, that money really shouldn’t be invested in the stock market to begin with.",This Week’s Market Sell-Off May Not Be Such a Bad Thing,2015-08-22,A remarkable run-up in stock prices probably needed a breather at a time when a range of markets had been starting to look a little bubbly.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/upshot/this-weeks-market-sell-off-may-not-be-such-a-bad-thing.html

Nearly 80 years after kicking out foreign oil companies, Mexico reversed course on Wednesday, auctioning 14 exploration blocks in an effort to attract international energy giants and increase the country’s slumping production.

But the results were a disappointment.

Only two blocks were successfully auctioned, and the largest companies capable of investing big sums did not bid or refused to participate.

The current low price of oil was a reason for the low number of bids. Prices are hovering around $50 a barrel, about half the price of a year ago.

Another was that the lots offered in the first round of a multiyear auction process were not among the most commercially attractive, according to energy experts.

“It was disappointing, but this is a long-term process,” said Jorge Piñon, a former president of Amoco Oil Latin America. “I think Mexico is promising because folks are looking at what the price of oil will be three to five years from now, which is the period of time it will take to develop the deep water offshore fields.”

The auction was a symbolically important step in a sweeping reform enacted last year. Under the plan by President Enrique Peña Nieto, foreign companies can now compete or partner with the national oil company Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, and profit from oil and gas production.

The goal of the government is to increase the country’s oil production over the next decade by approximately 40 percent to 3.4 million barrels a day, or nearly 4 percent of current world production.

The biggest growth will probably come in deep water fields that are adjacent to bountiful American production fields and that have yet to be thoroughly explored. The fields are thought to be large and have the added advantage of being close to the vast pipeline network in the American portion of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as to American refineries and the American market itself.

“People will look to the deep water,” said Gary Ross, executive chairman of Pira Energy Group, a global consultant company. “That’s where the great interest is and that’s where you are going to see a lot of international operations getting involved.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The auction was the first of four rounds through 2019 that will include a total of 670 exploration areas and 244 fields already in production. The first deep water Gulf of Mexico fields are scheduled to go on the bidding block early next year.

When Mexican officials first offered terms for the production and profit-sharing agreements of auction in December, they generated little interest from foreign companies, forcing the government to sweeten the financial terms. Some companies have said they worry about provisions that allow the government to cancel contracts in cases of industrial accidents or spills.

Before the bidding even began, Mexican officials lowered expectations. The round would be considered a success, they said, if just 30 to 50 percent of the blocks were auctioned off in the end.

The biggest companies that qualified to bid in the first auction — Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total of France — decided not to make any offers. Royal Dutch Shell did not participate, but executives say they are still interested in investing in Mexico.

“This turn toward growing Mexico’s energy future is historic and something we will continue to follow and evaluate with great interest,” said Mark Shuster, executive vice president for exploration at Shell Upstream Americas. He added that future major Mexican projects, particularly in the deep water Gulf of Mexico “will have to compete against our other global opportunities and choices.”

Several other companies did make bids, including Nexen Energy Holdings of China, Statoil of Norway, Eni of Italy, ONGC Videsh of India and Hunt Overseas Oil Company.

But some of the bids came below minimum terms set by Mexico. In others, companies submitted blank envelopes for bids.

The only two blocks successfully auctioned went to the same low-profile consortium of Sierra Oil and Gas, a Mexican company; Talos Energy, which is based in Houston; and Premier Oil of Britain. In one block, the government will receive 56 percent of operating profits, and in the other block 69 percent. The two blocks contain oil, while others contained natural gas, whose price is extremely low.

“We were starting to hear from many of the industry participants that some of the blocks were not ideal, not as attractive as people were expecting at the beginning,” said Oscar López-Velarde, Ernst & Young’s Mexico oil and gas tax leader and an adviser to several of the bidders.",Mexico Auctions Oil Blocks in Attempt to Increase Production,2015-07-16,"The major oil companies did not bid, and only two blocks were successfully auctioned.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/business/international/mexico-auctions-oil-blocks-in-attempt-to-increase-production.html

MOSCOW — Kazakhstan’s currency, the tenge, plunged by about a quarter on Thursday after the central bank stopped managing the exchange rate, prompting fears that a wider emerging market currency rout could be coming.

The surprise move in Kazakhstan was in response to falling prices of oil, the country’s main export, and earlier devaluations by its two main trading partners, Russia and China.

Also on Thursday, Vietnam devalued the dong, and currencies as far afield as the Brazilian real and the South African rand started to skid.

The next to drop, financial analysts say, will most likely be the currencies of Kazakhstan’s neighbors in Central Asia, a poor region with a population of about 50 million people: the Kyrgyz som, the Turkmen manat and the Tajik somoni.

The Kazak government had spent about $28 billion propping up the tenge over the last two years, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said in a televised meeting with the directors of major Kazakh companies. Continuing support for the tenge after China’s devaluation, he said, risked spending down hard currency and gold reserves, and hurting domestic producers.

“The price of this policy would have been shrinking output in the country, a loss of jobs and burning hard currency, that is, our reserves,” he said. “The state would have moved toward ruin.”

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Karim Massimov had announced that the central bank would pursue inflation targeting rather than an exchange-rate-targeting policy, in essence withdrawing support for the currency, prompting a run on banks and automated teller machines, which quickly ran out of dollars.

Led by China, emerging market economies are slowing, and Kazakhstan, the most commercially dynamic and wealthy of the former Soviet Central Asian states, is no exception. Growth averaged about 6 percent from 2011 until 2014, but the oil-dependent economy is expected to grow only 1.8 percent this year.

The currency devaluation was inevitable, Mr. Nazarbayev told the company directors. He asked the executives to buy tenge with hard currency earnings from exports to help ease the decline, mirroring a policy Russia used to soften a plunge in the ruble last winter.

“In a bad and unclear situation on our foreign markets,” he said, “this was a necessary measure and we had no alternatives. You know, we planned our programs differently, but a crisis always brings changes.”",Kazakhstan&#8217;s Currency Plunges,2015-08-21,"Financial analysts say the currencies of Kazakhstan&#8217;s neighbors in Central Asia will likely fall, as well.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/business/international/kazakhstans-currency-plunges.html
985,"OTTAWA — Apparently looking to exploit the collapse of oil prices, Suncor, the largest integrated energy company in Canada, announced a hostile takeover bid for Canadian Oil Sands on Monday that it valued at 6.6 billion Canadian dollars.

If successful, the transaction will give Suncor control of Syncrude, Canada’s largest oil sands operation, in addition to its own oil sands holdings. Canadian Oil Sands’ only asset is a 36.7 percent stake in Syncrude; Suncor currently owns about 12 percent of Syncrude.

Canada’s oil sands industry has been hit more severely by falling prices than conventional oil producers because of substantial costs related to creating crude oil from its deposits of tarlike bitumen.

During a conference call, Steve Williams, Suncor’s president and chief executive, said Canadian Oil Sands rebuffed a proposal by his company for a friendly takeover earlier this year. On Monday, he emphasized that the transaction offered a 35 percent premium over Canadian Oil Sands’ average weighted price over the last 30 days.

By accepting the deal, Mr. Williams said that Canadian Oil Sands will “gain ownership in an industry leader with a strong balance sheet, profitable operations and a clear path to future growth.” He added that the proposal’s share swap structure will also give them a way to profit when oil prices recover.

“We believe this is a financially compelling opportunity for C.O.S. shareholders,” Mr. Williams said in a statement.

Canadian Oil Sands had no immediate comment.

Suncor is offering to exchange one-quarter of its shares for each Canadian Oil Sands share, a bid it valued at 4.3 billion Canadian dollars. It will also assume 2.3 billion Canadian dollars in debt.

In a statement, Canadian Oil Sands said that its board is reviewing the offer. The company added that it had previously hired the Royal Bank of Canada for legal advice as well as the law firm of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt and Kingsdale Shareholder Services.

In a note to investors, Michael Dunn, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital in Calgary, Alberta, where Suncor is based, noted that the two companies’ oil sands operations “are more or less located right across the road from each other.”

Because of that, he said, “multiple billions of future costs could likely be saved” by integrating the two projects.

Mr. Dunn added that it was unlikely that Imperial Oil, Exxon-Mobil’s Canadian subsidiary which owns 25 percent of Syncrude, would make a competing bid given Suncor’s unique potential cost advantage.

The hostile bid is the second recent move by Suncor, which has a wide range of assets, including the refining and retailing assets of Petro-Canada, which it acquired during the oil price downturn in 2009. Last month, it paid Total 310 million Canadian dollars for most of its holdings in the Fort Hills oil sands operation. That transaction gave Suncor a stake of just over 50 percent.

Over all, stocks have been in the doldrums since the S.&P. 500 closed at a record high of 2,130 on May 21. Short sell-offs have been followed by short rallies as investors have weighed signs of an improving economy against signs of weakening growth overseas.

Among individual stocks, Tyson Foods was the biggest loser in the S.&P. 500 on Monday. The meat producer slumped $4.39, or 9.9 percent, to $39.96 after cutting its outlook for fiscal 2015 earnings.

The company, which owns the Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage brand, blamed conditions in the beef market for its trouble, citing high cattle costs and “export issues” as factors that were hurting its profits.

Michael Kors was a big loser, dropping $3.28, or 7.8 percent, to $38.71 on concern that demand for the luxury retailer’s handbags was dropping off. Analysts at the investment bank Canaccord cut their price target on the stock before the company’s earnings report due Thursday.

WASHINGTON — THE Iran nuclear deal offers a long-term solution to one of the most urgent threats of our time. Without this deal, Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, would be less than 90 days away from having enough fissile material to make a nuclear bomb. This deal greatly reduces the threat of Iran’s nuclear program, making Iran’s breakout time four times as long, securing unprecedented access to ensure that we will know if Iran cheats and giving us the leverage to hold it to its commitments.

Those calling on Congress to scrap the deal argue that the United States could have gotten a better deal, and still could, if we unilaterally ramped up existing sanctions, enough to force Iran to dismantle its entire nuclear program or even alter the character of its regime wholesale. This assumption is a dangerous fantasy, flying in the face of economic and diplomatic reality.

To be sure, the United States does have tremendous economic influence. But it was not this influence alone that persuaded countries across Europe and Asia to join the current sanction policy, one that required them to make costly sacrifices, curtail their purchases of Iran’s oil, and put Iran’s foreign reserves in escrow. They joined us because we made the case that Iran’s nuclear program was an uncontained threat to global stability and, most important, because we offered a concrete path to address it diplomatically — which we did.

In the eyes of the world, the nuclear agreement — endorsed by the United Nations Security Council and more than 90 other countries — addresses the threat of Iran’s nuclear program by constraining it for the long term and ensuring that it will be exclusively peaceful. If Congress now rejects this deal, the elements that were fundamental in establishing that international consensus will be gone.

The simple fact is that, after two years of testing Iran in negotiations, the international community does not believe that ramping up sanctions will persuade Iran to eradicate all traces of its hard-won civil nuclear program or sever its ties to its armed proxies in the region. Foreign governments will not continue to make costly sacrifices at our demand.

Indeed, they would more likely blame us for walking away from a credible solution to one of the world’s greatest security threats, and would continue to re-engage with Iran. Instead of toughening the sanctions, a decision by Congress to unilaterally reject the deal would end a decade of isolation of Iran and put the United States at odds with the rest of the world.

Some critics nevertheless argue that we can force the hands of these countries by imposing powerful secondary sanctions against those that refuse to follow our lead.

But that would be a disaster. The countries whose cooperation we need — including those in the European Union, China, Japan, India and South Korea, as well as the companies and banks that handle their oil purchases and hold foreign reserves — are among the largest economies in the world. If we were to cut them off from the American dollar and our financial system, we would set off extensive financial hemorrhaging, not just in our partner countries but in the United States as well.

Our strong, open economic relations with these countries constitute a foundation of the global economy. Nearly 40 percent of American exports go to the European Union, China, Japan, India and Korea — trade that cannot continue without banking connections.

The major importers of Iranian oil — China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey — together account for nearly a fifth of our goods exports and own 47 percent of foreign-held American treasuries. They will not agree to indefinite economic sacrifices in the name of an illusory better deal. We should think very seriously before threatening to cripple the largest banks and companies in these countries.

Consider the Bank of Japan, a key institutional holder of Iran’s foreign reserves. Cutting off Japan from the American banking system through sanctions would mean that we could not honor our sovereign responsibility to service and repay the more than $1 trillion in American treasuries held by Japan’s central bank. And those would be direct consequences of our sanctions, not to mention the economic aftershocks and the inevitable retaliation.

We must remember recent history. In 1996, in the absence of any other international support for imposing sanctions on Iran, Congress tried to force the hands of foreign companies, creating secondary sanctions that threatened to penalize them for investing in Iran’s energy sector. The idea was to force international oil companies to choose between doing business with Iran or the United States, with the expectation that all would choose us.

This outraged our foreign partners, particularly the European Union, which threatened retaliatory action and referral to the World Trade Organization and passed its own law prohibiting companies from complying. The largest oil companies of Europe and Asia stayed in Iran until, more than a decade later, we built a global consensus around the threat posed by Iran and put forward a realistic diplomatic means of addressing it.

The deal we reached last month is strong, unprecedented and good for America, with all the key elements the international community demanded to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

Berkshire’s stake of 57.98 million shares, or roughly 10.8 percent of the stock, was revealed on Friday night in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Phillips 66 shares closed at $77.23 on Friday.

Mr. Buffett’s company once held a large stake in Phillips 66, which is based in Houston, but shed nearly two-thirds of it in February 2014 when Berkshire swapped $1.35 billion worth of shares for a chemicals business that it folded into its Lubrizol unit.

Crude oil prices have since fallen more than half, though Phillips 66’s share price has dropped less than 1 percent.

A Phillips 66 spokesman, Dennis Nuss, said on Saturday that the oil company did not comment on specific shareholders.

Berkshire may have begun rebuilding its Phillips 66 stake in the second quarter, when it bought $3.09 billion of equities over all.

In an Aug. 14 S.E.C. filing detailing its United States stock holdings, Berkshire did not mention Phillips 66 — after previously reporting a stake of 7.5 million shares as of March 31 — but said it had disclosed some information confidentially to the regulator.

The S.E.C. sometimes lets Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, privately disclose details so that Mr. Buffett can quietly buy a large amount of stock without worrying about investors piggybacking on what they may think to be the famed investor’s stamp of approval. Mr. Buffett did this in 2013, when Berkshire amassed a $3.45 billion stake in Exxon Mobil. Mr. Buffett sold that stake in the fourth quarter of last year.

Berkshire does not normally say whether Mr. Buffett or his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, make specific investments, but larger investments are generally Mr. Buffett’s.

Since April, Phillips 66 shares have traded around or slightly above their current price, except for a brief drop last week to nearly $70.

LONDON — The British oil giant BP said on Tuesday that it lost $5.8 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a huge settlement over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

The roughly 40 percent fall in oil prices since last year is also sharply cutting into profits at BP and at other oil companies. In addition, oil price benchmarks have slid 20 percent over the last month to around $50 a barrel, reaching their lowest levels since March.

The global market is oversupplied by about 1.5 million barrels a day because of strong production in the United States and increased exports from OPEC members like Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Production is also up this year in Brazil, Canada and Russia despite declining oil company profits and sanctions on Moscow.

Besides lower prices, the central causes of BP’s profit decline in its oil and gas operations were sharply diminished production in the Gulf of Mexico because of maintenance and a write-down on exploration in Libya because of political turmoil there. BP also reported an operating profit from oil and gas exploration and production of $494 million in the second quarter, compared with $4.7 billion a year earlier.

BP made $9.8 billion in provisions in the second quarter for the $18.7 billion agreement in principle that the company reached on July 2 with United States authorities to settle penalties and damage claims arising from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010. Total provisions for the explosion, which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil, are now $54.6 billion.

The loss for the quarter compares with a $3.4 billion profit for the same period a year earlier.

BP executives indicated that they were preparing for a long period of low oil prices. The company said capital expenditure for 2015 was expected to be below $20 billion, compared with a forecast of $24 billion to $26 billion before oil prices started falling last year. The lower expenditure reflects the postponement of drilling and other activities, and reduced prices from suppliers and contractors.

The increases in Iraqi production and exports have been the big surprise for oil experts, given the spread of violence over the last year and the near collapse of cooperation between the central government and Kurdistan on oil production and revenue sharing. The nuclear deal negotiated with Iran has also persuaded oil traders that the global market will be flush with crude through 2016.

Traders have bid down the price of crude in recent days, after the news that the oil rig count in the United States last week rebounded by 21 rigs as drilling activity increased in several shale oil fields around the country. Based on the current rig count, Goldman Sachs projected that United States oil production could grow by 125,000 barrels a day by the fourth quarter of 2015 from the same period last year. That is significantly lower than the one million barrel a day annual production increase in recent years. But the projection is another sign of the resilience of American oil production, despite the decline in rig counts by more than 50 percent over the last year, helped by increased drilling efficiencies.",BP Posts Loss as Oil Spill Settlement and Sagging Demand Take Toll,2015-07-29,The roughly 40 percent fall in oil prices since last year is also sharply cutting into profits at the British company and at other oil companies.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/business/international/bp-earnings-q2.html

LONDON — Lower petroleum prices are shaking up the plans and bottom lines of the world’s biggest oil companies, and Royal Dutch Shell is the latest to show the effects.

On Thursday, the company reported a loss of $7.4 billion for the third quarter, in contrast to a profit of $4.5 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Adjusted for inventory changes and one-time items, a more closely watched measurement, earnings fell 70 percent to $1.8 billion.

The company took about $7.9 billion in write-offs for operations including its recently halted exploration venture off Alaska and a canceled heavy-oil project in Canada.

Like others in the oil industry, the company, based in The Hague, is grappling with its biggest challenges in decades. Not only must Shell and other companies adapt to the deep and potentially protracted slump in oil and gas prices, but they are also searching for an adequate response to global concerns about the role that petroleum fuels play in climate change.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Shell’s earnings from oil and gas extraction were pulled down by petroleum prices that in the third quarter averaged about 50 percent below what they were a year earlier. The company is beginning to take large write-offs as it cancels projects that no longer make economic sense in the current price environment. Shell also wrote off an additional $3.7 billion, including $2.3 billion on North American shale gas properties, because of downward revisions of the long-term outlook for the prices of gas and oil, the company said.

Ben van Beurden, who became Shell’s chief executive in 2014, has been reviewing the company’s investment plans and shelving some of its riskier and more costly efforts.

On Tuesday, for example, Shell said it was halting construction of an expensive oil sands project called Carmon Creek in the Canadian province of Alberta.

Carmon Creek was intended to produce 80,000 barrels of oil a day, a substantial amount, by heating heavy oil underground and pumping it out, a process that requires large amounts of capital upfront but then usually produces oil for decades. Shell said it would take a $2 billion write-down on the project.

“We are making changes to Shell’s portfolio mix by reviewing our longer-term upstream options worldwide, and managing affordability and exposure in the current world of lower oil prices,” Mr. van Beurden said in a statement on Tuesday. “This is forcing tough choices at Shell.”

Analysts say that Mr. van Beurden is trying to clean up mistakes by his predecessors and that doing so could allow Shell to focus on its strengths in liquefied natural gas and deepwater oil projects.

“Getting out of previous strategic missteps (Alaska, shale, more oil sands) via the impairments is a necessary evil,” Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.

Late last month, Shell ended its expensive and ultimately fruitless nine-year effort to explore for oil in the Alaskan Arctic, a $7 billion investment that Shell had pursued despite strong opposition from environmental activists. The company had long insisted that the offshore promise of Alaska made it worthwhile to bear the disapproval of environmental groups and to incur the huge costs of operating in the difficult Arctic environment.

In a conference call with journalists on Thursday, Mr. van Beurden said the well that Shell drilled in the Chukchi Sea this summer was “a dry hole” and “a major disappointment,” but that it was “very conclusive” and made further expensive drilling unnecessary. He added the company was “demobilizing” its fleet of drill ships and support vessels there and winding down the operation.

Mr. van Beurden also criticized the licensing process in the United States, saying that the American authorities “should simplify and modify the permitting process” if they have the ambition to further develop oil in the area. On Thursday, Shell said it was taking $2.6 billion in write-offs for Alaska.

But the biggest problem for Shell, like other oil companies, is making money from what traditionally has been the core business: finding, producing and selling oil and gas. Even without the big write-offs, Shell’s exploration and production unit lost $425 million for the quarter, compared with a profit of $4.3 billion a year earlier.

Simon Henry, Shell’s chief financial officer, said on Thursday in the conference call that the company’s break-even price for oil was about $60 a barrel. Prices for Brent crude have been hovering around $48 a barrel.

Mr. van Beurden also said that Shell would continue to move ahead with plans to acquire the British oil and gas producer the BG Group, and that he expected the transaction to close in early 2016.

Some investors have criticized the original price of $70 billion as too high, but Mr. Henry noted that because 70 percent of the price would be paid in Shell shares, which have fallen in value, there is “a natural hedge.”

Like its British rival BP, which reported a big dent in profit this week, Shell is being helped by its marketing, refining and petrochemicals units, where profits for the quarter were up sharply, to $2.6 billion from $1.8 billion a year earlier.

Other big producers are also feeling the downdraft of lower petroleum prices. The Italian company Eni said on Thursday that its adjusted operating profit fell by 75 percent to 750 million euros, or $828 million.

Some companies are proving more resilient than others. The French company Total reported on Thursday that its adjusted net income for the quarter fell by a more modest 23 percent to $2.8 billion, largely because of a strong performance at its refining and chemicals units.",Low Oil Prices Take a Toll on Royal Dutch Shell,2015-10-30,"Adjusted for inventory changes and one-time items, earnings fell 70 percent, and the company wrote off halted or canceled projects.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/business/energy-environment/royal-dutch-shell-oil-third-quarter-earnings.html
1002,"On U.S. 2 in North Dakota, just west of the turnoff for Tioga, you will spot two little brown highway signs pointing left:

Historic Site

5 Miles

And:

Lewis and Clark State Park

30 Miles

It would be natural to assume that the historic site has something to do with Lewis and Clark, but it doesn’t. Drive too fast or ignore your odometer and you will miss it: a narrow dirt drive that leads to a stout monument of reddish stone, maybe seven feet high. It reads:

Oil was first discovered in North Dakota by Amerada Petroleum Corporation April 4, 1951. This Williston Basin discovery, Clarence Iverson No. 1, opened a new era for North Dakota and reaffirmed the confidence of her people in the opportunities and future of this great state.

The monument was dedicated on Oct. 25, 1953, just two and a half years after the event it commemorates, but people had wildcatted for oil in North Dakota since 1916. After 35 years of fruitless drilling, you can understand why contemporaries would have regarded that first strike as historic.

Now, for some, the notion of this as a “historic site” could be jarring; oil might seem to mix with history as poorly as it does with water, or waterfowl. But in North Dakota, an oil boom is indeed historic. It does not look like history, at least not as we think of it; it looks like storage tanks, and gas flares, and towering derricks. Most of all, it looks like pump jacks, alone, in sets, always in motion.

North Dakota has had three oil booms; the most recent one, which started around the end of the last decade, is much larger than those of the 1950s and the 1970s. If you drive around the back roads of northwest North Dakota with a couple of lifelong residents, they can spot some of the older rigs from a half-mile off.

“That one’s from 1959,” a longtime farmer told me, pointing to a small black pump jack south of Lignite (named for the type of coal that used to be mined near there). “And that one, over there” — it was blue-green, like an old Chevy Bel-Air — “that’s from 1957. Still pumps 30 barrels a day,” he added, with respect.

Photo

These remnants of earlier booms look almost quaint. The city of Williston, the unofficial capital of the current boom, has grown in the past decade from about 12,000 residents to as many as 60,000, and some predict it will hit 100,000 before too long. Developers have built sprawling neighborhoods where everything — apartments, townhouses, free-standing houses, maybe thousands of units in all — is rented by oil companies. A stylish new apartment complex several miles east of town, surrounded by absolutely nothing, harks back to a mid-1880s photo of a towering apartment house at 72nd Street and Central Park West, a location then so remote that the edifice was named the Dakota.

The open plains are dotted with modular “man camps”: The shabbier ones are haphazard collections of RVs, trailers and cabins; the nicer ones look like mobile home parks with scores of units, perfectly aligned and identical down to the placement and angle of their satellite dishes. The largest resemble military bases.

The roads, flat and endlessly straight, can be a pleasure to drive, as long as all the newly rendered potholes have been patched adequately. Traffic is a function of the price of oil; above $80 or $90 per barrel, and it could start to look displeasingly metropolitan. At $50-something, though, as it was when I last visited, you can cruise and pass at leisure as you seek out that giant gravel pit you overheard someone talking about in your hotel’s breakfast room, or that cluster of 250,000-barrel oil tanks across the way from a towering old grain elevator, a scene that in the gloaming brings to mind King Kong squaring off against Godzilla.

All of it — flares, derricks, pumps, King Kong — is surrounded by wheat. Occasionally you will spot a pond with water as blue-black as the North Atlantic; but mostly there’s wheat. Miles of it. And somehow, it keeps the petroleum works in check, even makes them look clean. Some of that, to be sure, is the fact that they are new, but these are also not the dusty, grimy oil fields of West Texas or the San Joaquin Valley, at least not yet. In the right frame of mind, you might even find something romantic in the sight of a pair of bobbing pump jacks silhouetted against the setting sun.","In North Dakota, Boom, Bust and Oil",2015-08-09,"North Dakota’s northwest region, which has seen Native Americans, Lewis and Clark and settlers come and go, is home to the state’s latest oil boom.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/travel/north-dakota-oil-boom.html

1004,"Business wonk that I am, my favorite moment in last week’s Republican debate came when Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump got into a spat over which of them had the lousier track record as business leaders.

“The company is a disaster,” scoffed Trump, referring to Hewlett-Packard, the iconic technology company Fiorina ran from 1999 to 2005. Trump continued: “When Carly says the revenues went up that’s because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company.”

Fiorina responded by focusing on how Trump ran his three Atlantic City casinos into the ground. “You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses,” she said, “using other people’s money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice [but] four times, a record four times.”

They’re both right. Fiorina’s tenure at HP was indeed a disaster, and Trump’s casino interests did indeed file for bankruptcy multiple times. Now that Trump and Fiorina are number one and number two in a recent poll — oy! — it’s worth taking a closer look at their business records.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Fiorina’s effort to revise her reputation began in October 2006, some 20 months after she was ousted as the chief executive of HP, when she published her autobiography. In it, she claimed that she had taken a company that was adrift and gotten it humming again. She described her firing as the action of a dysfunctional board, which it certainly was. But that was in no small part because the directors played Charlie Brown to her Lucy. Again and again, she would say that progress was right around the corner, and they believed her; again and again, she disappointed.

By every metric that mattered, HP was in far worse shape when she was fired than when she was hired. The company’s stock price dropped more than 50 percent during her tenure, compared to a 7 percent drop in the S.&P. 500. And net earnings dropped to $2.4 billion from $3.1 billion during that same time. The Compaq merger, meanwhile, was a misguided fiasco; today, virtually all remnants of it have disappeared from HP. Fiorina’s me-me-me leadership style demoralized the company and its shareholders. When she walked out the door in February 2005 — with a $21 million severance package — the stock jumped nearly 7 percent.

Trump? He’s a business legend, all right, — in his own mind. To listen to him, you’d think he is the greatest business person of all time. He is not even close. What he mainly is, as his presidential campaign is proving, is our era’s P.T. Barnum.

The key fact about Trump’s early success is that it would never have happened without his father Fred’s money. As Tim O’Brien points out in his highly entertaining 2005 biography, “TrumpNation,” Trump would have flopped in his first foray in the big time — turning the Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt in Midtown Manhattan — if his father had not lent him the money to cover cost overruns.

According to O’Brien, Fred Trump bailed out his son on other occasions, most notably when he bought $3.5 million worth of chips at one of Trump’s casinos — and then didn’t use them to gamble, in violation of state casino regulations — so that his son would have enough to make a loan payment.

As for the casino bankruptcies, Trump likes to characterize them as shrewd business moves, and stresses that he never filed for personal bankruptcy. But those corporate bankruptcies were costly; he wound up having to give up many of his real estate holdings, and was even put on a monthly budget for a time.

And with some $900 million in personal guarantees, he avoided personal bankruptcy by a whisker. Again, according to O’Brien, Trump borrowed millions from his siblings to keep his head above water. Today, a far more cautious Donald Trump runs what amounts to a Potemkin company, with a staff that mainly licenses his “brand.” He owns very few of the buildings with the Trump name on them.

Trump claims, implausibly, to be worth over $8 billion. (Forbes puts his net worth at half that amount.) But even taking him at his word, that sum is less impressive than you’d think. As several writers have pointed out, if, in 1988, he had simply put his money in a stock index fund, it would be worth $13 billion today. In effect, his post-1988 business career has cost him $5 billion.

Even putting aside their policy positions, their narcissism, their poor records as leaders and their lack of scruples in spinning failures as triumphs all suggest that Fiorina and Trump would make terrible presidents. To my mind, there is only one entrepreneur who has both a record of true business accomplishment and government service to merit consideration as a presidential candidate.

1007,"Other Emerging Markets Are Getting Hammered

Some of the key evidence for the “this is about more than China” story comes from other emerging markets, stretching from Malaysia to Mexico, that are also taking it on the chin. Their currencies and stock and bond prices have fallen sharply over the last week. Some of that drop most likely reflects exposure to the Chinese economy. But some of it reflects something bigger.

Call this the Taper Tantrum 3.0.

The original taper tantrum happened in June 2013. It is a cute name for what occurred when global financial markets collectively went berserk over the realization that the Fed was serious about tapering its program of quantitative easing — or put more plainly, that the Fed would wind down its injections of money into the financial system over time. There was a second, similar explosion of volatility in October 2014, as the Fed’s intentions to raise interest rates in 2015 became clearer.

In effect, the Fed’s easy money policies had led global investors to search for higher-yielding securities, which they found in many faster-growing emerging markets. Money gushed into these countries in search of better returns from 2010 until 2013, driving up asset prices.

But as the end of the era of cheap dollars has approached, that hot money has withdrawn — and created volatile spikes in interest rates and damage to those emerging economies. (Look at this presentation by Hyun Sung Shin of the Bank for International Settlements for a more detailed argument around how and why this happens).

Falling Oil Prices Are a Cause and Effect

The turmoil in financial markets has had a particularly big impact of the price of commodities, including oil, the most economically significant commodity of them all.

The price of a barrel of oil fell from around $60 in late June to under $40 on Monday. Over time, that will be good news for American and European energy consumers, but there are complex feedback loops that probably make the commodity sell-off both a cause and a result of the broader emerging markets panic.

When oil prices first plummeted in the second half of last year, there were widespread forecasts that the price drop would cause oil exploration to shutter around the world, helping keep the market in balance. Instead, American producers have kept up production, keeping supplies high despite lower prices.

Oil Prices Have Plummeted Price per barrel of crude oil $60 50 40 Brent West Texas Intermediate Jan. Feb. March April May June July Aug. Price per barrel of crude oil $60 50 40 Brent West Texas Intermediate Jan. Feb. March April May June July Aug. Price per barrel of crude oil $60 50 40 Brent West Texas Intermediate Jan. April Aug.

Here’s the feedback loop: The slowdown in China and other emerging markets lowers demand. High supplies and weak demand equals lower prices — which feeds back into weaker economic conditions for energy-producing countries like those in the Middle East, Latin America and Russia.

Then the Fed Makes Its Move

In the background of all of this is a crucial decision looming for the United States Federal Reserve. Fed officials have expressed confidence that the domestic economy is on track and that the time is right to raise interest rates after nearly seven years of keeping them near zero. It could make that move at its policy meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.

Fed officials have indicated a determination to base interest rates on what is most appropriate given the state of the American economy and not to overreact to fluctuations in markets. The latest volatility will test that resolve.

Futures markets are increasingly betting that the Fed will indeed hold off to assess the damage to the economy, if any, from the latest global financial strains. On Monday, the market priced in a 24 percent chance of a rate increase in September, compared with a 48 percent chance just a week ago.

And the value of the dollar on currency markets fell 1.6 percent on Monday (as measured by the dollar index) as investors priced in greater likelihood of the Fed’s keeping rates lower for longer.

Commentators have long accused the Fed of overreacting to the latest financial market moves, a complaint that makes Fed officials bristle; they argue they are making their decisions based on measures of the real economy like inflation and employment data. If markets remain volatile heading into the next meeting but economic data remains consistent with recent solid readings, that will make for a tough decision.

Of course, it is the Fed’s job to set policy based on where the economy is going, not where it has been. If markets keep falling, that could endanger American growth prospects. On the other hand, the Fed’s job isn’t to try to protect investors from the risks of a downturn.

MEXICO CITY — As the price of oil was plummeting in July, the Mexican government auctioned off leases to explore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. With energy companies retrenching, the auction was a failure.

But Mexico’s fortunes changed on Wednesday. In a follow-up auction, the Mexican government put five production blocks up for bid and awarded contracts for three, well above the average for similar auctions in Latin America.

The success of Wednesday’s bidding appeared to put the government’s new oil policy back on track. Mexico has ended more than 75 years of a state monopoly to invite in foreign investment in an attempt to end a decade-long decline in oil production.

Investors were attracted by relaxed rules and by the characteristics of the blocks, which hold probable oil and gas reserves, analysts said.

“I think the message is clear,” said Oscar López Velarde, Ernst and Young’s oil and gas tax leader in Mexico, who advised some of the bidding companies. “As soon as you see a good selection of blocks, you will see people coming into the country.”

The Italian national oil company Eni International won the block that attracted the most bids, offering more than double the government’s minimum price. An Argentine-led consortium including Pan American Energy, in which BP has a stake, won a second block.

The third block had only one bidder, a consortium made up of an American company, Fieldwood Energy, and a Mexican company, Petrobal. The former director of exploration and production for Mexico’s state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos, Carlos Morales Gil, is the director of Petrobal.

Another auction, set for the middle of next year, is likely to attract the most interest. Those are for deepwater areas in the Gulf of Mexico, just south of American waters where international oil companies have found large reserves of oil and gas.

“Does any of what worked today work for deep water?” said Jeremy M. Martin, director of the energy program at Institute of the Americas in La Jolla, Calif. “That’s what they need to work out in the coming weeks and months.”

For the July auction, the first to offer production-sharing agreements for private investments, rigid regulations for the bidding and the type of blocks being offered for exploration ended with the disappointing result: Contracts for only two of 14 blocks up for bid were awarded.

This time around, the National Hydrocarbons Commission in Mexico relaxed many of the rules and gave companies two weeks’ advance notice on the minimum price that it would accept, a measure intended to give companies time to adjust their bids. It also extended what companies could do in the areas up for auction, adding the right to explore for new oil as well as pumping oil from the existing reserves.

“I think it was another good sign that the government took the approach to fix what did not work in the first bid,” said José Antonio Prado, a lawyer with Holland & Knight, who has worked in the energy industry.

With the blocks auctioned on Wednesday holding probable reserves, production is expected to begin as early as 2020, according to Pablo Medina, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an oil consultancy.

“The assets are good,” said Read Taylor, executive vice president for Sierra Oil and Gas, a Mexican company with backing from the American private equity firms Riverstone and BlackRock. Sierra won the two blocks that were awarded in the first auction but was left empty-handed on Wednesday. “It was a very competitive market today.”",Successful Auction for Oil Drilling Rights in Mexico Follows Weak Debut ,2015-10-01,"The Mexican government put five oil production blocks up for auction on Wednesday and awarded three, a much more successful outcome than the first such auction in July.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/business/international/successful-auction-for-oil-drilling-rights-in-mexico-follows-weak-debut.html

SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Petrobras, Brazil’s troubled petroleum giant, is returning to the global capital markets with plans to sell a 100-year bond issue.

The offering, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, is Petrobras’s first since it sold $8.5 billion, in six different maturities, in March 2014.

The company had been shut out of the markets after a corruption scandal caused it to delay the release of its third- and fourth-quarter results, which finally came out on April 22.



A person with knowledge of the transaction said late Monday morning that the new bond deal would be “at least $500 million” but that “right now it looks like it will be less than $1 billion.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The person said the company was expecting to pay about an 8.85 percent yield on the bonds. The S.E.C. filing lists JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank as underwriters.

If the expected interest rate is confirmed on Monday’s bond issue, Petrobras will be paying a high price.

Before this offering, the company was paying an average interest rate of only 4.4 percent on its $76.4 billion in dollar-denominated debt. Its 30-year bonds sold in 2014 paid a 7.25 percent coupon.

“I do not see this move as a positive,” said Mariana Bertone, a petroleum analyst with the brokerage firm GBM in São Paulo. “The cost is very high.”

Other issuance is expected soon. Petrobras said late last month that it planned to issue up to 4 billion reais, or $1.26 billion, in debentures in the local market, where interest rates tend to be higher than in the global market.

But to keep its heavy debt load – nearly $130 billion – from rising too much further, Petrobras announced in March that it would sell $13.7 billion of assets this year and next.

Offshore petroleum reserves, electricity generation plants, chains of service stations in other South American countries and parts of its distribution network are all likely to be on the auction block.

The company needs the cash to pay for its five-year investment plan, which despite cuts is still expected to total more than $130 billion when it is announced next week. So far this year, Petrobras’s petroleum production has fallen slightly since peaking last December.

Despite the company’s problems, it may have a promising future, if global energy prices recover.

“It has the best expertise in the world for deepwater petroleum production,” Ms. Bertone said.",Petrobras Seeks to Sell a 100-Year Bond,2015-06-02,A high yield is expected to be the price the troubled petroleum giant pays to return to the global capital markets.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/business/dealbook/petrobras-seeks-to-sell-a-100-year-bond.html

HOUSTON — The Obama administration shut the door Friday on drilling in Alaska’s Arctic Ocean over the next two years, canceling auctions for drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.

The decision by the Interior Department was not surprising because it came less than a month after Shell Oil canceled the most advanced exploration project in the region because of disappointing results from a test well and high costs at a time when oil prices are extremely low.

Still, the announcement is symbolically important as the administration steps back from its cautious support of drilling in the Arctic.

“It does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic,” said the Interior secretary, Sally Jewell. She cited the current plunge in oil prices, the amount of offshore acreage already under lease and Shell’s recent decision to put off further drilling after spending $7 billion on a project that ended up producing no oil.

The Interior Department also rejected longstanding appeals by Shell and Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant, to extend existing Arctic leases first obtained during administration of George W. Bush. Taken together, the decisions are a sharp blow to the Alaskan economy, which has been declining because of the fall in oil prices and the state’s slumping oil production.

Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, called it a “stunning, shortsighted move,” adding that it was “the latest in a destructive pattern of hostility” displayed by the Obama administration toward the energy industry in the state.

Several other oil companies had already decided to suspend plans to operate in the Alaskan Arctic, where winter darkness and harsh conditions make drilling expensive and potentially harmful to the fragile environment.

Environmentalists applauded the move after months of criticizing the administration for allowing Shell to go forward. Lois Epstein, Arctic program director for the Wilderness Society, called the decision “entirely reasonable” because of Shell’s failure.

Seven companies hold drilling rights in the Chukchi Sea, the area with the highest production potential, but Shell was the only one to begin an active exploration program. Shell’s many accidents and delays served as a cautionary example to other companies even before the price of oil collapsed by more than half over the last year.

For years, the Arctic appeared to be the next big frontier for oil companies with old, mature reserves. But with the advent of hydraulic fracturing of shale fields, the United States has become glutted with oil.

Offshore Arctic drilling is not only in decline in the United States but also in Canada and Greenland.

SÃO PAULO, Brazil — The troubled energy giant Petrobras has suffered a setback in its effort to put its financial house in order. The company announced on Thursday that it was postponing an offer to sell at least three billion reais, or about $790 million, of debentures in the local capital markets.

The company’s statement said it was “interrupting” the offer as a result of “adverse conditions in the Brazilian capital markets.”

The offer was the company’s first effort to tap the capital markets since its century bond in June. The century bond was considered a success at the time, but since then its value has plummeted as concerns over the company’s finances mount.

Petrobras has about $110 billion in debt, and at current oil prices its cash flow is negative.

Wagner Salaverry, a managing partner at the Brazilian asset manager Quantitas, said Petrobras representatives had been shopping the debentures for weeks, but “the price was not enough to compensate for the company’s risk.”

The company had been offering the debt in three separate maturities, of five, seven and 10 years. The shortest-term tranche would have paid investors 185 basis points over the country’s interbank overnight lending rate, which is currently 14.13 percent.

That would have resulted in an interest rate of nearly 16 percent. Interest rates in the Brazilian debt market tend to be high as inflation is over 9 percent. Still, it was not enough to attract buyers.

“This is a highly leveraged company,” Mr. Salaverry said. “The government stands behind it, but the government has fiscal problems, too.”

The proposed offering was significant not so much for the sum involved, but as a sign of whether or not the company could get access to new capital. Even though the offer was in reais, the company’s bankers had been marketing it to foreign investors as well.

Mr. Salaverry said the company was not in any immediate trouble, since it easily has enough cash on hand to make roughly $10 billion in debt payments due next year.

“If they move more aggressively to sell assets, cut investments and raise domestic fuel prices, I think the capital markets will open to them,” he said.

Petrobras announced in June a plan to raise $15 billion through asset sales by the end of next year, but so far the company has managed to raise only $126 million.

Poor capital market conditions obliged the company to call off what would have been the biggest asset sale, a spinoff of its petroleum distribution unit BR Distribuidora, and Petrobras said on Wednesday that it was now looking for a “strategic partner” for the unit.

It also said at the end of September that it was in “final negotiations” to sell a 49 percent stake in its natural gas distributor, Gaspetro, to Mitsui Group of Japan.

And the company is also turning to China for capital.

1023,"Just as crucially, the techniques that Chevron is experimenting with in the North Sea could lead the way for other oil companies around the world to coax continued life from aging offshore energy operations — wherever they are — and learn from some industry mistakes.

In a sense, British waters are a microcosm of the global industry. Costs, especially for offshore operations, have risen across the globe, eating into profits and reducing incentives for new exploration.

Despite the global push toward renewable energy and onshore drilling of oil and gas from shale in the United States and elsewhere, the world is likely to require a long-term, adequate supply of undersea oil — if it can be extracted economically. Chevron, for one, has postponed a big Scottish deepwater project called Rosebank, where the North Sea gives way to the North Atlantic just northwest of the Shetland Islands, judging it not feasible under current industry economics.

As other large oil companies in the region have, Chevron has turned to layoffs and other cost-cutting moves. While total industry job cuts in the North Sea region have so far been in the low thousands, the management consulting firm Ernst & Young forecasts that as many as 35,000 of the 375,000 jobs related to the oil industry in Britain could be lost over the next four years.

“It is a very tough time,” said Alexander Kemp, a petroleum economist at the University of Aberdeen. “Budgets have been cut substantially. At most companies, the effects of that are still working through.”

But Chevron is not simply retrenching. In August, the company opened its new operations center, with digital communications equipment, at an office park in the hills overlooking the gray granite buildings of Aberdeen.

Photo

The center for the first time puts managers in constant video and voice contact with their counterparts on platforms more than 100 miles offshore. And it lets managers and technicians in Aberdeen monitor the performance of compressors, pumps and hundreds of other pieces of offshore equipment involved in extracting fossil fuels from beneath the seafloor.

Industry executives say such innovations are long overdue.

“The problem of the industry is not the oil price — it is the efficiency of the industry,” said John Pearson, president for northern Europe at Amec Foster Wheeler, which provides services like platform operations and maintenance for energy companies. “It didn’t work at $100 a barrel,” Mr. Pearson said, so it is even more critical at today’s prices.

Chevron says the operations center, staffed most days by about two dozen people, enables the company to identify problems and intervene before having to take the costly step of temporarily shutting down production. An 18-year-old platform called Captain, for example, ran for 125 days without having to curtail production for maintenance, about four times as long as usual.

The wells in the Captain field extract not only oil but also a lot of water — which creates an emulsion that can interfere with the well’s pump over time, slowing production. But with the operations center, technical engineers onshore can detect such problems early and alert the team on the platform to open the pump further or change the settings. Chevron credits this capability for enabling a new well in the Captain field to produce 3,000 more barrels a day than initially planned.

As a result of these new efficiencies, Chevron said it saved $31 million in the center’s first eight months.

During the heady period from 2011 to mid-2014 — when prices of the North Sea benchmark oil, Brent crude, averaged more than $100 a barrel — industry executives were willing to spend lavishly to make sure their projects took priority. There were bidding wars for skilled labor. And the owners of equipment like drilling rigs and supply boats were able to demand premium rates for their services.

Now, with costs and revenue so far out of sync, the situation is particularly dire in the North Sea because production has declined more than 50 percent over the last decade, to about 1.4 million barrels a day.

“The issue in the North Sea is existential around the cash cost of operation at the current level of oil prices,” Simon Henry, Royal Dutch Shell’s chief financial officer, said recently while discussing the company’s quarterly results.

And in the North Sea, no company is an island.

The region is a vast web of interconnected fields and pipelines and other infrastructure, with different owners, that transport the oil and gas. If one company closes a node in this network, others might be forced to shut down portions of their own operations. Chevron, for example, lost production for several months from a field called Erskine because its oil flowed through a field operated by the BG Group. That field had been closed since October for an upgrade but recently came back online.

“It takes only one field that has exposure to a piece of infrastructure to put the whole system in jeopardy,” said Derek Leith, an energy consultant at Ernst & Young in Aberdeen.

Once fields start to shut down, the companies cannot simply abandon them. International laws require the companies to safely and cleanly dismantle the platforms and underwater equipment, a process with considerable costs. The industry is projected to spend about 15 billion pounds, or about $23 billion, in the next decade on North Sea decommissioning — spending the industry can hope to partly defer the longer it can squeeze life from existing operations.

Apache, a midsize oil company based in Houston, is considered something of a model. In 2003, Apache acquired a portion of the Forties field, a vast North Sea plot 140 miles northeast of Aberdeen that was discovered in 1970 and once produced about a half-million barrels a day. By the time Apache bought its portion from BP, output had dwindled to 41,000 barrels a day.

But Apache has raised production 20 percent, to about 50,000 barrels a day, by investing in new wells and installing more electrical generators to reduce downtime, according to James L. House, the company’s North Sea manager until this month. “We all have access to the same level of technology and hire people with similar educational backgrounds,” he said. “It is how decisions are made and how they are executed.”

At Chevron, Mr. May says he is encouraged by his company’s efforts to reclaim the North Sea. Chevron is continuing with development of a new field called Alder. And the giant Rosebank project could yet go ahead, Mr. May said.

“We have been here for 50 years,” he said. “We want to stay.”",Chevron and North Sea Rivals Race to Keep an Oil Region Relevant,2015-06-03,Oil producers in Britain are contending with plummeting prices as they seek new ways to bolster the aging infrastructure of the North Sea industry.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/business/international/chevron-and-north-sea-rivals-race-to-keep-an-oil-region-relevant.html

With demand dwindling, the current market of 94 million barrels a day has roughly two million barrels in surplus supply.

Now, economic forces have scuttled what environmentalists had tried to do for years in the courts and with raucous protests in canoes and kayaks, arguing that drilling in the dark, ice-filled Arctic was dangerous to polar bears and other sea life.

“This is a victory for everyone who has stood up for the Arctic,” said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace, a leader in the protests against Shell. “There is no better time to keep fossil fuels in the ground, bringing us one step closer to an energy revolution and sustainable future.”

When Shell first leased a huge portion of Alaska’s Chukchi and Beaufort Seas after they were opened up by the George W. Bush administration, oil prices were soaring. Middle classes in China and the developing world were demanding more liquid fuels every year. At the same time, a growing number of oil fields around the world were aging and in decline.

Then, just as Shell began its Alaskan effort, the shale revolution began in the United States. Independent oil companies found ways to fracture hard rocks to produce oil, nearly doubling domestic production. That surprise development, along with the slowing Chinese and European economies, drove the oil price down just as Shell returned to drilling in the Chukchi this year. The environmental movement delayed Shell at every turn, but the 2010 BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico pushed the company off several years as well.

Industry experts say that there is plenty of oil in offshore Alaska and that renewed efforts are still possible if and when the oil price recovers. But environmentalists declared a triumph.

Shell has spent more than $7 billion on an effort that has been plagued by blunders and accidents involving ships and support equipment, reaching a climax with the grounding of one of its drilling vessels in December 2012 in stormy seas. Even after ConocoPhillips and the Norwegian oil giant Statoil suspended their Alaskan offshore drilling operations, Shell carried on, asserting that the Chukchi Sea potentially represented the next great global oil find.

But the company announced that its one well drilled this summer “found indications of oil and gas, but these are not sufficient to warrant further exploration.” In a statement, it also acknowledged “the high costs associated with the project and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska.”

The decision represented a major turnaround from the faith in the project that Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, expressed as recently as August. At the time, he said that Shell’s holdings in the Alaskan Arctic could be “multiple times” more bountiful than the enormous fields in the Gulf of Mexico. “We can’t be driven by today’s, tomorrow’s, or next year’s, or last year’s oil price,” he said.

Shell’s efforts to drill in Alaska have long seemed quixotic. It came closest to finding oil in 2012 when it drilled two shallow wells but had to stop short of deeper oil zones after several bizarre accidents, including the crushing of a containment dome during a vital test. This summer, a storm whipping though the Arctic Ocean forced Shell to suspend drilling, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service made a regulatory ruling that cut back the company’s drilling plans.

After a Finnish icebreaker hired by Shell struck an uncharted shoal in the Aleutians in July, it was forced to go to Portland, Ore., for repairs. Protesters there tried to block the vessel, going so far as to suspend themselves from a bridge over the Willamette River.

Shell’s current venture into the Alaska offshore began under Mr. van Beurden’s predecessors, and he has always been concerned about the project’s costs and risks. Soon after he became chief executive in 2014, he temporarily halted drilling in Alaska because of legal and regulatory issues.

He came around to the view that the potential bonanza was worth the expense and headaches, but now that drilling has produced an unexpectedly poor result, he may have decided to follow his original instincts and call a halt.

“This first dry well seems to have been the trigger for the C.E.O. to pull the plug on their Alaska exploration campaign,” said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research in London.

The Alaska operations have cost billions of dollars. Shell said the value of Alaska drilling on its balance sheet was $3.1 billion and that it had a further $1.1 billion in contractual commitments, probably for items like drilling rigs. The company said it would take write-offs as a result of the decision to halt drilling.

“Shell continues to see important exploration potential” in offshore Alaska, Marvin E. Odum, president of Shell Oil, said in a statement. “However, this is clearly a disappointing outcome.”

Energy experts have expressed skepticism about the economics of Arctic drilling for some time.

“The number of special challenges, unforeseen things you have to deal with, long supply chains, just make it very difficult to have the same level of confidence around costs as you do for development elsewhere,” said Andrew Slaughter, executive director of the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions.",Shell Exits Arctic as Slump in Oil Prices Forces Industry to Retrench,2015-09-29,"In one sign of the industrywide trend, Royal Dutch Shell has ended its expensive nine-year effort to explore for oil in the Alaskan Arctic.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-alaska-oil-exploration-halt.html
1028,"HOUSTON — When the Obama administration began considering the Keystone XL pipeline seven years ago, oil production in the United States was falling and most analysts thought it would never recover. At the same time, Mexican oil production was also in decline, meaning that domestic refineries would soon need another source of crude.

Canada, and its expanding oil sands industry, seemed like the perfect solution. But so much has changed in the oil patch since then that many energy experts say the Keystone pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected on Friday, matters far less than it once did.

Domestic production has nearly doubled and has flooded the market with so much crude oil that prices have plummeted. Refineries along the Gulf Coast still need the heavy crude Canada produces, but they are finding new ways to obtain it, and storage facilities are filled to the brim.

“Keystone XL is not nearly as important as it seemed to be a few years ago,” said Rusty Braziel, the president of RBN Energy, a consulting firm. “For Gulf refineries it is not a huge deal.”

In just the past three years, two million barrels of new crude pipeline capacity has been built around the Gulf of Mexico region, and more pipelines are on the way, capable of transporting Canadian crude along with domestic oil.

Rail connections from Canada, built to move oil in part because of the Keystone delays, have multiplied. And with crude prices expected to stay relatively low for years, the expansion of Canadian oil sands production has slowed.

South of the border, Mexican officials are putting in place a change in the Constitution to allow foreign oil companies to invest in their fields, opening the possibility of a rebound in Mexican production over the next decade. Even without the Keystone XL, total American imports of Canadian crude — from oil sands as well as more conventional varieties — have increased to 3.8 million barrels a day from 2.5 million barrels a day since 2008 while imports from OPEC countries have plummeted.

Still, the pipeline’s proponents see a long-term benefit to building it to transport 830,000 barrels a day, mostly from Canada. Dependence on Canada for energy is less fraught with risk than reliance on countries like Nigeria or Saudi Arabia, proponents say.

“It’s ironic that the administration would strike a deal to allow Iranian crude on the global market while refusing to give our closest ally, Canada, access to U.S. refineries,” Jack Gerard, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement.

The oil industry has plenty to gain from the pipeline. It would make producers’ considerable investments in Canadian oil sands production more valuable, while ensuring American refineries a secure source of crude for decades. Labor unions joined in the call for the pipeline, pointing to the thousands of jobs that its construction would produce.

The domestic shale revolution has mostly produced a flood of light sweet oil, which does not match exactly with the needs of many Gulf of Mexico refineries which were intended to process heavy Mexican, Venezuelan and Canadian crude.

But the landscape in the refinery business has changed as well in recent years as refineries have invested heavily to take the new local output. That has enabled the refiners around Houston to reduce their imports of medium and heavy crude to 900,000 barrels a day in July from an average of 1.4 million barrels a day in 2010, a new RBN Energy report found.

The biggest change has been the construction of pipelines not named Keystone XL in the United States.

The Obama administration, for example, approved a shorter section of the pipeline connecting the storage field in Cushing, Okla., with Texas refineries, allowing an increase in both Canadian and domestic shipments of 700,000 barrels a day. At the same time, Enbridge and Enterprise Partners expanded a separate pipeline system, called Seaway, which can now deliver 850,000 barrels a day from Cushing to the Gulf refinery hub.

That means, energy experts said, that American consumers should not feel a difference.

“In terms of distribution and what people will pay, Keystone doesn’t really mean much,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. He said more Canadian oil “will go by rail to some places or by pipeline to others.”

All told, the Gulf refineries have tripled their processing supplies of Canadian crude since 2010 to more than 300,000 barrels a day, according to Andy Lipow, the president of Lipow Oil Associates, a consulting firm based in Houston.

“The urgency for the pipeline is certainly down because oil prices are $45 and not $100 a barrel, and you are seeing a decline of investment in Canada, which means that increases in expected future growth are simply not going to be there,” Mr. Lipow said.

But he has a nuanced view, seeing potential benefits for the pipeline in the years ahead.

“No one has sat down and calculated how much greenhouse gas we have emitted from fighting wars in the Middle East,” he said.",Oil Supply Picture Has Changed Since Keystone Was Proposed,2015-11-07,"Seven years ago, production in the United States was falling, some thought permanently, and Mexico’s industry was also in decline.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/business/energy-environment/oil-supply-picture-has-changed-since-keystone-was-proposed.html

1031,"Let’s put aside how eminent domain proceedings ended up provoking a settlement that cost taxpayers more than $90 million for a truck rental lot on a decrepit industrial site. The bottom line is that the system is capricious, promotes extortion and often acts against the public interest. While private developers quietly accrue properties to assemble big projects, keeping their intentions secret and upfront costs down, government must act openly, as it should, the upshot often being that landlords can have City Hall over a barrel.

The rezoning process invariably opens the door to speculators, like the ones now in East New York, where for months the de Blasio administration has been publicly mulling over a plan to encourage subsidized housing. Speculators have been buying properties there, escalating housing prices, creating instability for poor tenants in the neighborhood before a single new subsidized apartment is built — exactly the opposite outcome intended by the prospective rezoning.

The mayor’s latest budget strengthens legal services for endangered residents in districts slated for rezoning and puts aside $1 billion as a kind of rainy-day slush fund for unanticipated costs associated with those rezonings, the example of Bushwick Inlet Park being a prime cautionary tale. Both good moves.

But last week Mayor Bill de Blasio’s parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, told the City Council that there was no money in the budget to acquire CitiStorage for Bushwick Inlet, which, despite its name, lies at the heart of Williamsburg hipsterdom, in the midst of Brooklyn Bowl, the Music Hall, Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg. East River State Park is next door. McCarren Park is a few blocks away: The city has also poured millions into fixing it up.

Spending millions more on a park in this affluent neighborhood is not the mayor’s priority, even though he voted for the rezoning in 2005. The mayor has said he wants to fix a few dozen neglected community parks in underserved areas of New York. At the same time, he wants to cut parks funding drastically from what it was under Michael R. Bloomberg — a big disappointment and a missed opportunity to spread social equity and environmental justice.

Meanwhile, that sympathetic judge, Abraham Gerges, a former city councilman for Williamsburg, no longer sits on the bench.

So here’s one scenario: The city could test its luck again in court over CitiStorage.

Eventually, Mr. Brodsky may come to his senses and negotiate for his site with the city, or find some buyer who will need to approach City Hall with a proposal. The mayor might then try to grab a chunk of the site to meet his affordable housing commitment. His argument would be that rezoning the site for some mixed-use development would throw off money to defray park costs.

Brooklyn Williamsburg Bushwick Inlet Bay Fuel depot Brooklyn Flea East River CitiStorage Proposed future Bushwick Inlet Park EAST river state park Smorgasburg Bushwick Inlet Park (existing) Williamsburg

But what kind of development? How big? And how would the neighborhood be compensated? Stephen Levin, the councilman for the district, told me last week that he would vote against any rezoning. “More and more people in the community have come together around this issue,” he said.

“We have a robust capital budget in the city now, and that $1 billion is being budgeted for other areas this administration wants to rezone,” he added. “In my personal life, I try not to take on new debts before I pay off my old ones. Our community has been waiting years.” He asked how City Hall can again be relied on to fulfill its commitments if it reneges on this one.

I wondered whether there were other nearby sites to which development rights for the CitiStorage property could be transferred. Mr. Levin said there are none that wouldn’t cost the public a fortune. I mentioned a large city-owned waterfront plot near the Brooklyn Navy Yard, south of Division Avenue, which could be turned into a new park. Might that sweeten some deal, extending an already evolving network of green space along the Williamsburg waterfront?

It’s too far away from Bushwick Inlet, Mr. Levin said.

He added, “We only have one opportunity to get this right, and I’d rather wait than get it wrong.”

In its rush to rezone, the Bloomberg administration clearly failed to anticipate events.

So at this point maybe patience is the only answer. Adrian Benepe, a former city parks commissioner, reminded me of the Chelsea Recreation Center.

In 1964, Mayor John V. Lindsay’s administration decided to tear down an ancient public bathhouse on West 28th Street to make way for a mail-sorting facility, with the promise that a recreation center would be built. Construction was delayed until the mid-70s, when the fiscal crisis hit and the project halted. A quarter-century more passed. Chelsea transformed.

Then Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani picked up the gauntlet and Mr. Bloomberg cut the ribbon in 2004. Born in an era that envisioned a home economics room for girls, the new recreation center opened in an age of stair-climbing machines.

1054,"A slump in oil prices sparked a global sell-off in financial markets on Friday with losses spreading from Asia to Europe to the U.S., where stocks fell sharply to cap their worst week since the summer.

The selling was broad, with all 10 sectors of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ending down. Fearful investors put their money in government bonds, especially U.S. Treasurys. Another measure of fear in the markets, the so-called Vix index, jumped and is now up 70 percent in just five days.

Investors worry the sharp fall in the price of oil and other commodities is a sign of weakness in the global economy, especially China, and that will cut into profits at big energy companies and suppliers of raw materials as well as other companies.

“We’re stockpiling commodities and demand is not picking up,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors. “It’s kind of a depressing market.”

Energy shares, already decimated this year, fell 3.4 percent on Friday. Southwestern Energy plunged 14 percent. Freeport McMoRan, a mining giant, dropped 6 percent.

What’s the Current Price of Oil? Brent crude, the main international benchmark, was trading around $ a barrel on . The American benchmark was at around $ a barrel. This is why oil prices have dropped so much since 2014.

The trouble began with a report from the International Energy Agency that said the oversupply in oil would persist until late next year even as demand continues to weaken. Benchmark U.S. crude plunged $1.14, or 3 percent, to close at $35.62 a barrel in New York. It has been falling for 1 ½ years and is now at its lowest level since early 2009.

By the end of the day, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 39.86 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,012.37. It was down 3.8 percent for the week, its worst showing since August.

In Europe, Germany’s DAX lost 2.4 percent, Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 2.2 percent and France’s CAC 40 shed 1.8 percent.

Investors were also rattled by trouble in a risky corner of the credit markets where bonds from heavily indebted companies are traded. Their prices have fallen sharply as investors fear the companies that issued the bonds might default. A fund that tracks the bonds, the iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, dropped nearly 4 percent in five days.

Investors were also focused on a Federal Reserve meeting next week where the central bank is widely expected to announce an increase in its benchmark interest rate from a record low.

Recent economic reports indicate that the U.S. economy is healthy enough to withstand a rate hike, but investors are still nervous because it would be the first rate rise in nearly a decade.

WASHINGTON — For months, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, formed a quiet, persistent alliance as they sought to convince their colleagues that it was time to end a more than 40-year ban on crude oil exports.

They turned the Senate floor into a symposium on the history of Nixon-era oil price controls. They offered up lectures on modern-day energy economics. They stressed the potential for using crude oil exports to increase American soft power — by limiting the reliance of American allies on oil-producing rivals like Iran and Russia.

And they also regularly drew the anger of liberal senators who warned that lifting the ban would harm the environment and potentially raise energy costs in the United States.

In the end, it seems, their efforts were an exemplar in soft-power legislating. After months of cajoling, Congress seems to be on the verge of lifting the crude oil export ban as part of a giant year-end spending and tax deal.

As high-stakes negotiations on the spending and tax packages continued Thursday between congressional leaders and the Obama administration, the Senate approved an emergency stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown and give negotiators five more days to reach a deal.

Meanwhile, an admonition by the White House press secretary suggested that Democrats and Republicans were still deadlocked over some politically charged policy prescriptions.

Officials in both parties, however, said that a provision to end the oil export ban remained at the center of the talks, possibly tied to an extension of tax credits for wind and solar power. Lifting the ban would represent a historic shift in American energy policy. It would also be a towering victory for the senators’ home states, where oil producers and related businesses have been hammered by a global downturn in prices.

Liberal supporters of the export ban have complained that ending it would harm the environment and hurt American consumers — an argument that has become more difficult to make at a time of relatively low gasoline prices. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized the push to lift the ban, but his remarks also focused on the need for extending tax credits for renewable energy — a signal that some sort of deal may be inevitable.

Analysts often note that the debate around the crude oil export ban is extremely complicated — a point emphasized by the fact that while domestic oil production in the United States has risen sharply since 2009, by more than two million barrels per day, projections show that American imports of foreign oil will continue at a rate of six million to eight million barrels per day through 2040. This is largely because of differences in the types of crude oil, with excess amounts of light, sweet crude being produced in the United States while domestic refineries are designed to handle heavier, sour crude from abroad.

At the energy committee hearing on Wednesday, several experts on global oil issues testified that lifting the crude oil export ban would be a positive step — even if the impact was relatively imperceptible at first because of current low prices.

The limited immediate impact — and particularly the reduced chance that lifting the export ban would increase gasoline prices for American motorists — has made the prospect of ending the ban more politically palatable to the Obama administration and many Democrats and even some Republicans who feared a backlash should constituents see a rise in prices at the pump.

In that sense, lifting the ban would deliver a long-sought policy victory for congressional Republicans at a time when many rank-and-file lawmakers are angry that Senate Democrats and the White House often block much of their legislative agenda.

The Republican-controlled House has twice voted this fall to approve legislation that would end the crude oil export ban. Legislation proposed by Senators Murkowski and Heitkamp has yet to reach the Senate floor, but would not need to if their proposals are included in the year-end spending and tax deal.

In her version of the legislation, Ms. Heitkamp had included provisions that might make a compromise with the White House easier, including a proposal that would give the president the authority to restrict exports for up to one year under certain circumstances and to extend those restrictions on an annual basis. Among the acceptable reasons for doing so would be national security threats, or a national emergency including an oil shortage or a spike in prices.

Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, noted recent testimony by the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, who said a decrease in oil production was a drag on the economy. “Both on an economic and national security, and I might add, environmental basis,” Mr. Cassidy said, “there’s such a strong case for allowing U.S. export of oil.”

At a policy forum in September, Ms. Heitkamp expressed optimism in the face of long odds. “When we started over a year ago, everybody thought we were crazy,” she said. “Everybody told me, ‘You are crazy to think this is going to happen in the short term.’ I kept saying, ‘I think we can get this done this year if we are willing to respond to some of the concerns, if we are willing to come to the table and actually negotiate.’ ”",End of Crude Oil Export Ban Is Possible,2015-12-11,"After months of cajoling by senators from two oil-producing states, Congress seems to be on the verge of lifting the ban as part of a giant year-end spending and tax deal.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/us/politics/end-of-crude-oil-export-ban-is-possible.html

Nearly every mainstream climate scientist has said that a big portion of the fossil fuels now in the ground must remain there if the world is to avoid the worst consequences of global warming. That simple fact lay at the heart of President Obama’s decision on Friday to say no to the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada.

The decision, which ends seven years of legal and political wrangling, was correct, on moral as well as scientific grounds. The pipeline, when completed, would have carried about 800,000 barrels of oil a day from tar sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast.

In the grand scheme of things, this would add little to a global output that now exceeds 90 million barrels a day. But the cumulative impact could be huge: The tar sands contain 170 billion barrels of oil recoverable with today’s technology and perhaps 10 times that amount in potential resources. Because the proposed pipeline was seen as crucial to the exploitation of these resources, allowing it to go forward would have put the United States in the position of enabling a project that, over time, would add significantly to already dangerous levels of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

So Mr. Obama chose to draw a line. As he put it, “Ultimately, if we’re going to prevent large parts of this earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we’re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them and release more dangerous pollution into the sky.”

Mr. Obama touched on several other factors that played into his decision. One is that the United States does not need the oil. For various reasons, including big discoveries in Texas and North Dakota as well as stronger fuel economy standards, oil imports have dropped substantially over the last few years. Canada’s tar sands oil would thus add little to America’s energy security and make very little difference in the price of gasoline at the pump, which is already falling and is, in any case, determined largely by the global price of oil.

Nor would the pipeline create meaningful, lasting jobs. A State Department analysis estimated that it would provide 3,900 construction jobs over a two-year period, plus thousands of support jobs, but no more than 50 permanent jobs thereafter.

Saying no to the pipeline does not prevent the Canadians (and the American companies that have invested in the tar sands) from extracting the oil, which they have been doing. That extraction has already taken a huge toll on Canada’s boreal forests, which are an important storehouse of carbon. At least the United States will not be complicit in their further destruction.

Next month, Mr. Obama will join other world leaders at a global summit meeting in Paris aimed at brokering an agreement among more than 190 nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Because of various initiatives undertaken or proposed by his administration to promote energy efficiency, cleaner fuels and a lower-carbon economy — most recently a new rule that would greatly reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide — Mr. Obama already has strong credentials on climate change. They have been made stronger still by his success over the last year in extracting pledges to reduce emissions from reluctant Chinese leaders.

Rejecting the Keystone pipeline should further enhance his credibility and that of the United States on this issue. “America is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change,” he said. “And frankly, approving this project would have undercut that global leadership.”","No to Keystone, Yes to the Planet ",2015-11-07,President Obama’s rejection of the pipeline speaks to the crux of the battle against global warming: More fossil fuels need to stay in the ground.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/opinion/no-to-keystone-yes-to-the-planet.html

Many oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron, have had to slash their payrolls this summer. Chesapeake Energy, which has prized assets here in the Eagle Ford, recently scrapped its dividend to save cash. Another Eagle Ford producer, Linn Energy, an energy producing partnership structured as a limited liability company, stunned Wall Street recently by announcing its intention to suspend payments to investors to conserve cash.

Producers that have been shielded by contracts that allowed them to sell oil at higher than benchmark prices are gradually being exposed as those agreements expire. The depressed oil price is limiting the ability of companies to borrow as they have to write down field assets that are used as collateral for loans.

One result, analysts say, will be a painful consolidation among oil producers as the weak and indebted are forced to sell to the strong.

The consulting firm IHS recently studied 66 companies and found that in the first quarter of the year alone they had to write down nearly $29 billion in the value of their assets, easily exceeding the total for the full year of 2014. The sale of cheapened assets from one company to another has already begun here in the Eagle Ford, and more consolidation is expected.

Then came hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and the surge in oil production it unleashed.

Crumbling towns here reinvented themselves with new restaurants, markets and hotels as money and jobs poured in. Construction began on several new schools and a major hospital to accommodate the new residents.

Today, even with the price of oil plummeting, no county in Texas comes close to producing as much crude as Karnes County — 6.8 million barrels in June alone. Twenty rigs operated by giants like ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Murphy Oil continue to churn through hard rock thousands of feet below ground.

Most local officials say the county is still far better off today than before the shale boom, when it was one of the poorest in the state. Back then, the biggest employer was the local jails, and local ranches were forced to sell off their livestock after years of drought.

Despite the downturn, the oil still flows, thanks to producers’ advances in efficiency.

During the second quarter of the year, Marathon Oil, for instance, averaged 32 percent more oil and natural gas production in the Eagle Ford than in the same quarter a year before.

But even those days are set to end. With the number of rigs now drilling in the core Eagle Ford counties dropping to 79 from a peak of 206 only nine months ago, and with production from a shale well declining as much as 60 percent the year after it is completed, output is bound to begin a steep decline in the coming months unless prices rebound.

“With the amount of oil we’re sitting on top of, it’s devastating that we can’t go get it,” said Matt Kibodeaux, the local project manager for Energy Maintenance Services, a Houston company. The company, which lays pipes to connect well pads to larger pipelines here, employed 186 people here a year ago but is now down to 18.

The local service companies are suffering because the major operators are cutting costs by forcing them to slice their prices and fees.

Supreme Vacuum Services, which hauls fracking fluids and oil well waste water, is being paid 20 percent less this year for its services. With revenue and profits down considerably, it has reduced the hours of its drivers, released the least efficient drivers and installed new software in the office to replace secretarial help. From an average payroll of 92 last year, it is down to 75, according to the local management.

“There is a point where I can’t reduce my prices anymore,” said Brooks Holzhausen, the company’s chief operating officer here. “Any more cuts, you sacrifice safety and quality, and I am not going to do that.”

For all the grief, local officials here say their county is still destined to have a great future once the oil price recovers, as they say it surely will.

LONDON — BP’s future no longer has a giant cloud ahead. But it will take years, if not decades, for the company to approach its size of five years ago, before the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig.

Since the 2010 blowout of the Macondo well killed 11 rig workers and dumped millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico, BP has vigorously fought in court and on American television to salvage its image and minimize the costs. But in preparation for a settlement to resolve legal wrangling over economic and environmental damages, in which it eventually agreed to pay $18.7 billion, the British-based company also had pruned its global operations to save itself.

To shore up its finances, it gave up its former ambition to reach the size of Exxon Mobil, the giant of global oil giants. It sold refineries and natural gas fields in the United States, and trimmed its reach across Russia, Central and Southeast Asia, and the North Sea. From the time of the accident through 2012, it sold off $38 billion in assets, and raised $12 billion more in cash from selling its stake in the Russian company TNK-BP.

With the settlement, BP executives breathed a sigh of relief and Wall Street analysts who cover the company declared a victory for it, albeit only compared with the potential damages it had faced. BP and the analysts emphasized that $18.7 billion — an average of just over $1 billion to be paid annually over 18 years — would be a manageable burden for a company that earned a profit of $2.6 billion in the first quarter despite low oil and gas prices.

“It makes me feel like the company can now plan its future,” Robert Dudley, BP’s chief executive, said in an interview. “It allows us to have this manageable cash flow, including increasing a commitment to investment in the U.S., which was increasingly uncertain for us.”

BP’s share price in the United States jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday, closing at $41.29, even though the company will add $10 billion to the $43.8 billion in provisions for cumulative pretax charges that it has already taken.

Wall Street analysts praised the settlement for dealing with almost all of the company’s major liabilities, and its penalties are lower than many expected under the federal Clean Water Act as well as settlements with the gulf states. Payments to the states and federal government will not begin for another year, giving the company relief at a time when revenue is dropping because of the 40 percent drop in oil prices over the last year. Much of the payment will be tax-deductible.","After Settlement, Relief at a Diminished BP",2015-07-03,"In preparation for a settlement over the 2010 gulf disaster, BP has sharply pruned its global operations to save itself, and now it can plan for its future.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/business/energy-environment/diminished-bp-in-deepwater-horizon-settlement.html

THE United States government recently announced an $18.7 billion settlement of claims against the oil giant BP in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in April 2010, which dumped millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Though some of the settlement funds are to compensate the region for economic harm, most will go to environmental restoration in affected states.

Is BP getting off easy, or being unfairly penalized?

This is not easy to answer. Assigning a monetary value to environmental harm is notoriously tricky. There is, after all, no market for intact ecosystems or endangered species. We don’t reveal how much we value these things in a consumer context, as goods or services for which we will or won’t pay a certain amount. Instead, we value them for their mere existence. And it is not obvious how to put a price tag on that.

In an attempt to do so, economists and policy makers often rely on a technique called “contingent valuation,” which amounts to asking individuals survey questions about their willingness to pay to protect natural resources. The values generated by contingent valuation studies are frequently used to inform public policy and litigation. (If the government had gone to trial with BP, it most likely would have relied on such studies to argue for a large judgment against the company.)

Contingent valuation has always aroused skepticism. Oil companies, unsurprisingly, have criticized the technique. But many economists have also been skeptical, worrying that hypothetical questions posed to ordinary citizens may not really capture their genuine sense of environmental value. Even the Obama administration seems to discount contingent valuation, choosing to exclude data from this technique in 2014 when issuing a new rule to reduce the number of fish killed by power plants.

Do we respond to contingent valuation studies the way we respond to all other known classes of economic decisions? Or do we behave differently when environmental value is involved?

To find out, we conducted a study, just published in the journal PLOS One, that compared, at a neurological level, how people responded in both situations.

In the budding field of neuroeconomics, researchers have found striking similarity in the brain structures responsible for valuation across a host of different kinds of decision making. Our study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine activity in the brain’s valuation areas when subjects were asked to value environmental proposals (for example, protection of sea turtles, cleanup of the Gowanus Canal in New York), snack foods (e.g., tortilla chips), consumer goods (e.g., “The Simpsons: Complete Sixth Season” DVD, a Moleskine notebook) and time spent on daily activities (e.g., jogging, doing laundry).

Across all four types of questions, neural activity indicated that participants were paying attention. But when it came to putting values on things, we found differences. Specifically, when people put values on consumer goods, foods and time spent on daily activities, this was correlated with neural signals in the traditional valuation areas of the brain. But when people answered survey questions about the value of environmental proposals, their brain activity was uncorrelated with these areas.

The takeaway was clear: The brain did not respond to contingent valuation studies the way it did to all other known classes of economic behavior.

This means that contingent valuation does not line up with what we know about the neural basis of ordinary economic decision making. However, we do not yet know how it fails to line up. Contingent valuation may overestimate environmental valuation; it may underestimate it; it may overestimate sometimes and underestimate at other times.

Where to go from here? The trick will be to figure out how to use functional magnetic resonance imaging technology, or other such tools, to directly estimate how people value the environment in economic terms.

Of course, none of that will settle deeper philosophical questions of environmental ethics — for example, whether we owe something to future generations that individual valuations of our natural resources do not capture. But additional research can give insight into how people genuinely value the world around them, which should give a clearer picture of how grave a harm is caused by disasters like the BP spill, and how much the offenders should pay.",What Is Nature Worth to You?,2015-08-09,Our brains assign monetary value to the environment in a special way.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/opinion/sunday/what-is-nature-worth-to-you.html

1070,"Robert W. Dudley, BP’s group chief executive, called the agreement “a realistic outcome which provides clarity and certainty for all parties.”

In separate news conferences across the gulf, governors and attorneys general highlighted the portions of the settlement that their states were likely to receive. They vary from state to state, with Texas estimating a final total of about $800 million, and Louisiana, which was most heavily damaged by the spill, projecting more than $6.8 billion.

In 2012, Congress passed the Restore Act, which redirects 80 percent of Clean Water Act penalties — previously deposited into the federal Treasury — to the affected states. With this money and the natural resources damage payments, which also go to the gulf, the settlement is a windfall for the states, even if it is paid out piecemeal.

Where the Money Has Gone BP has spent billions to settle claims and cover costs in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Among the payments are:

Negotiators tried without success in the past to reach a settlement, though they came close more than once. One failed round of negotiations, on the eve of the trial in 2013, would have produced a total amount not much less than what was announced on Tuesday, said David M. Uhlmann, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and a former federal prosecutor of environmental crimes. But the exact mix of money within that deal was different; for instance, state and local economic damages were not a part of it.

“The problem then was that Louisiana and to a lesser extent Alabama had unrealistic expectations for how much they should receive,” he said, adding that in the years since “the states became much more realistic.”

The findings at trial put pressure on BP, as did the downturn in global oil prices. But the oil price drop also brought pressure on Louisiana, which, like Alabama, had been already facing severe budget crunches.

Garret Graves, a member of Congress from Louisiana who served as the state’s top coastal restoration official and represented the state in prior negotiations with BP, said he could not comment in detail on the negotiations. But he insisted that much had changed since the initial talks.

“Some of the earlier discussions with BP reminded me of the circuslike, disconnected response to the spill itself,” he said. The intervening years brought “significant changes within BP’s command and control,” allowing for the new agreement.

With this deal, BP gets valuable certainty, especially as it does not include any clause that could reopen litigation. The extended payment schedule also allows it to absorb the pain in manageable doses.

And because they will receive billions in economic damage claims, money coming through the Restore Act and the natural resources damages process — far more than they would have obtained in litigation — the states, Professor Uhlmann said, “made out like bandits.”

Environmental groups had a mixed reaction to the announcement, with some welcoming it as overdue, others condemning it as too little and still others expressing a cautious optimism.

Bethany Kraft, director of the Gulf Restoration Program at the Ocean Conservancy, welcomed news of the settlement, but emphasized that this was only the beginning of the work. She highlighted $232 million set aside under the settlement that, combined with interest from other payments, is meant to address any natural resources damages that are discovered after the settlement is in effect. Such money she described as critical but possibly insufficient, as some environmental damage from the spill may not be understood for decades.

“Let’s put it this way: I’m still going to come in to work tomorrow,” Ms. Kraft said. “I think it’s still critically important for all of us to pay attention to how this money is spent.”

On the state level, the different sources of money come with different strings attached. Money paid in economic damages would primarily go into state coffers, while the natural resources damages payments must be spent on environmental restoration. The Clean Water Act penalties would mostly be divided up among the states and a Gulfwide council under a formula laid out in the Restore Act, which directs that the funds be spent on the “ecological and economic restoration” of the gulf.

BP already made a $1 billion down payment to states for early restoration projects, some of which was directed toward controversial projects like a hotel in Alabama. But for the most part, the money has been seen as critical to addressing longstanding environmental problems.

Much of the settlement money in Louisiana will go to environmental protection and restoration along the state’s ravaged and rapidly disappearing coast. The state has spent years developing a master plan for addressing environmental damage and the wetlands loss that long preceded the BP spill. The $50 billion plan, with some projects already underway or completed, calls for extensive levee construction and for beefing up barrier islands and restoring portions of the state’s vanishing wetlands in order to provide a greater degree of natural protection from hurricanes.

This proposed agreement would end federal and state involvement in a three-phase trial that began more than two years ago in one of the most complex and closely watched civil cases in United States history. Over the course of the trial, which took place in New Orleans, the Justice Department argued that the company should pay the maximum federal penalty of $13.7 billion, or $4,300 for every barrel spilled, under the Clean Water Act in cases of gross negligence.

On Thursday, BP set the ultimate cost associated with the spill at nearly $54 billion, though there are still some unknowable expenses to come. While the settlement clears away most of the liability exposure that BP faces, it does not eliminate some shareholder claims or private claims from thousands of individuals and businesses whose efforts in court will continue. BP has settled hundreds of thousands of such claims since the spill.

Testimony in the two-year civil trial ended in February, and on Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of Judge Barbier’s liability determination of BP and Anadarko, the co-owners of the Deepwater Horizon well.

And the settlement, as some pointed out, is not yet set in stone.

“I knew nothing about it,” said Tony Kennon, the mayor of Orange Beach, Ala., a tourist town that was devastated during the summer of the spill, and which has sued BP for $50 million. Mr. Kennon insisted that the lawsuit was not over as far his town was concerned and that he now expected to seek more in damages.

However, he also expected a nice Fourth of July weekend.

When Mr. Ross first bought development land here in 2000, he paid about 27,000 Canadian dollars an acre. He stopped buying land long before it hit one million Canadian dollars an acre.

“The town has had huge growing pains,” Mr. Ross said. “It’s like something you’ve never seen.”

Operating oil sands plants quickly decreased budgets and cut services, like equipment cleaning, which were deemed optional. And as portions of construction projects are finished, construction workers are sent packing. The halt on new projects has left order books increasingly blank at a variety of suppliers, like engineering firms.

Since the price collapse, Teck Resources has delayed the start of its oil sands project by five years to 2026. Cenovus Energy substantially reduced budgets for its long-term developments. And Osum Oil Sands has set aside some of the expansion planned for a project it purchased from Shell last year. The Chinese-owned company Nexen, which had its oil sands production curtailed by regulators for about a month in August because of a pipeline leak, has deferred plans to build another upgrader facility, where tar-like bitumen of the oil sands is converted into synthetic crude oil, until the end of 2020.

These projects, and others that have begun over the last 15 years, have largely been built and operated by an itinerant work force. These workers fly into Fort McMurray’s new airport terminal and are bused to work camps up to two hours away. Their lives are a cycle of three straight weeks of long shifts interrupted by 10-day trips home.

That transient population has little or no connection to the city when working. When laid off, they become unemployment statistics, not in Alberta, but in the provinces of their hometowns. It’s also in those regions, more than Alberta, where the loss of once-large paychecks is most felt, having a ripple effect across the country.

For Canadian oil executives, the significant shift in the province’s politics is of great concern. Rachel Notley, the new premier and leader of the New Democratic Party, has said that she would prefer more refining to take place in Alberta instead of shipping more oil sands production to the United States via Keystone XL. And speaking to the Alberta Chamber of Commerce last month, Ms. Notley told the energy industry that it must “clean up its environmental act.”

One executive and investor, who did not want to be named while the province is reviewing his industry, said growing sentiment that the industry does not pay Alberta enough in royalties and lags on environmental protections will kill new investments, even if prices start to rise.

“There’s never been a time when I’ve been less optimistic,” he said. “The general public doesn’t know how bad it is. It just hasn’t hit yet.”

He did, however, acknowledge that environmentalists had won the debate on Keystone XL as well as various other pipeline plans.

“I don’t know how the issue got away, but it’s obvious now that it did,” he said.

And the workers who have benefited from the boom are now realizing that their stretch of good luck might be over, permanently.

Réjean Godin, a truck driver and heavy equipment operator, began the long-distance commute from the Atlantic province of New Brunswick 13 years ago. Since then, he’s earned wages four or five times the rate of those back home, an area of high unemployment.

Standing near his well-worn Toyota RAV4 that still bears New Brunswick license plates, Mr. Godin, who lives in a work camp, recited all of the different projects in which hundreds of workers had been laid off — layoffs that he’d learned about over the previous few days.

Stocks rose for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, helped by a stabilization in crude oil prices. Chipotle Mexican Grill fell on more concern about the safety of its food.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 165.65 points, or 1 percent, to 17,417.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 17.82 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,038.97, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 32.19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,001.11.

Trading was light. Many investors have closed their portfolios for the year or are on vacation for the Christmas and New Year’s holidays.

However, a modest recovery in oil prices helped lift energy and materials stocks.

“Investors are either done for the year or are setting up their portfolios for 2016, buying this year’s winners or doing reallocation to their portfolios,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.

Chipotle Mexican Grill’s shares fell $27.40, or 5 percent, to $494.61 after it disclosed additional cases of E. coli at its restaurants.

Markets are searching for direction as the flow of economic data slows greatly until after Jan. 1. Investors have already had plenty of time to digest the recent major decisions by the Federal Reserve to raise rates and by the European Central Bank to increase its stimulus efforts.

Many investors expect stocks and bonds to trade in a narrow range until January.

The oil industry and its friends in Congress, mostly Republicans, want to get rid of restrictions on exports of crude oil that were established 40 years ago during the energy crisis. President Obama and most Democratic lawmakers are rightly opposed to such measures, at least in their current form.

A boom in oil production in recent years has created a domestic glut, in part because American refineries do not have the capacity to process the grade of crude oil discovered in Texas and North Dakota into gasoline, diesel and other marketable fuels. Producers are therefore pressing Congress and the Obama administration to allow the sale of American crude oil abroad — above and beyond the very limited exports now allowed by law.

Congress forbade oil exports in 1975, when the nation was still reeling from the Arab oil embargo and long gas lines, allowing only exceptions in the “national interest.” Until recently, there was no serious interest in changing that policy, not least because dwindling reserves made America increasingly dependent on imports from volatile and sometimes hostile parts of the world. Between 2010 and 2014, however, domestic oil production shot up 59 percent, to 3.2 billion barrels a year, according to the Energy Information Administration, while imports dropped 21 percent, to 3.4 billion barrels a year.

Companies that produce oil argue that removing export restrictions would boost the economy and provide foreign allies with another source of oil, so they would rely less on Russia and the Middle East. But companies that refine oil are worried that making it easier to sell American oil abroad would increase overall demand, raise the price they pay for crude and hurt their profits.

The environmental community vigorously asserts that allowing more exports would increase oil production, open sensitive offshore waters to drilling and increase the carbon emissions responsible for climate change.

There is no question that policy makers need to figure out ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels and lower emissions. However, a recent report by the Energy Information Administration asserts that lifting export restrictions would result in a very small increase in oil production in the next 10 years, and would have little to no impact on domestic gasoline prices. Changing the law would lower profits for refiners by about $22.7 billion over the next 10 years, but would boost profits for oil producers by as much as $29.7 billion.

Therein may lie the seeds of a bargain. The House on Friday passed a bill lifting restrictions on crude oil exports. The White House has said it will veto it — a veto the Republicans almost certainly cannot override. But what if the industry and the Republicans offered a deal — a bill, say, that would lift the ban on exports in exchange for a host of measures that could actually help in the fight against climate change?

These measures could include long-term extensions of tax credits for renewable fuels like wind and solar power, which are set to expire next year. And any such bill would have to put a stop, once and for all, to some of the billions of dollars of lucrative and wholly unnecessary tax breaks that the oil and gas industry has enjoyed for years.

What’s the Current Price of Oil? Brent crude, the main international benchmark, was trading around $ a barrel on . The American benchmark was at around $ a barrel. This is why oil prices have dropped so much since 2014.

The dozen OPEC countries, and other big oil producers like Mexico and Russia, find themselves in a double bind — pressed by the new low-carbon ethos represented by the climate conference and squeezed by a global oil glut that has caused prices to plunge by more than 50 percent since early last year. New supplies, led by shale oil from the United States, have caused the dollar-value oil revenue of OPEC, Mexico and Russia to fall by half since 2014. Their response is to keep producing and selling, with an almost fire-sale desperation.

“Individual countries are trying to get every bit of revenue they can in this tough situation,” said Spencer Welch, an analyst at IHS, a research firm.

As OPEC’s market clout has diminished, the organization has become increasingly fragmented. Members including Venezuela and Algeria are urging production limits in hopes of propping up prices.

But Saudi Arabia — still the world’s single biggest petroleum exporter — argues, along with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, that production cuts would be pointless because they would only cede more of the global market to the shale producers in the United States and other rivals.

“What distinguishes OPEC members from other producers, now that the group sets neither prices nor output quotas?” said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS. “Nothing, really.”

OPEC said on Friday that the group had decided to wait to make any changes in production quotas until it could see how much oil Iran would be exporting once Western sanctions are lifted. The group also wants to see what effect continued low prices might have on production levels from non-OPEC producers.

“We need to wait and watch,” Nigeria’s oil minister, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, who presided over the OPEC meeting, told journalists on Friday.

In a statement, OPEC said that at its meeting the group stressed the importance of its members to be “actively and positively engaged” in the Paris climate negotiations and agreed that “climate change, environmental protection and sustainable development are a major concern for us all.”

Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup, in Vienna for the OPEC meeting, said that on the climate issue, the biggest OPEC exporter, the Saudis, were “damned if they do and damned if they don’t.”

New curbs on fossil-fuel consumption would put the Saudi economy at risk, he said. But the Saudis risk global scorn if they are seen as climate obstructionists, and Saudi Arabia knows its own environmental future hangs in the balance. Unless something is done soon about global warming, the sun-baked, arid Arabian Peninsula could become almost uninhabitable.

But Saudi Arabia, which is participating in the climate talks, has not yet been willing to make many concessions.

The country, which is a big consumer of its own oil and gas and was the world’s 11th-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2013, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, has pledged to reduce its annual CO 2 emissions by 130 million tons by 2030, compared with what the level would have been without intervention. But Saudi Arabia has not said what the level would have been otherwise.

The Saudi document describing the plan says that even this pledge is conditional on the economy’s continuing to grow with “a robust contribution from oil export revenues” and on international climate-change policies not imposing a “disproportionate or abnormal burden on the kingdom’s economy.”

But like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia acknowledges that climate concerns are a reason to make its economy more diversified and energy-efficient. Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 30-year-old son of Saudi Arabia’s king, is said to be leading the effort.

Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, who now heads his own consulting firm, said, “There is a big move to reduce energy consumption in the kingdom.”

The Saudi government, Mr. Husseini said, is considering imposing tougher vehicle fuel-efficiency standards as well as raising the price of water derived from energy-intensive desalination plants. It is also studying the feasibility of collecting carbon dioxide emitted from factories and pumping it into aging oil wells. That might squeeze more production from nearly depleted wells, but would at least offset some of the carbon debt.

But analysts caution not to expect any quick shifts by Saudi Arabia, which still depends on oil for nearly half of its economic output and 90 percent of its export revenue. Though the country is a monarchy, analysts say, the leadership prefers to act on the consensus of the country’s technical experts and will be wary of upsetting constituents by raising fuel prices — particularly at a time when so much of the region is in political chaos.

In the United Arab Emirates, a much smaller economy where the rulers take a more top-down approach, diversification has come much faster. Three-quarters of the economy now involves non-oil activities. Progress away from petroleum has been quicker, with 75 percent of gross domestic product coming from non-oil activities.

Mr. Belhoul, the chief of Masdar, which is leading the United Arab Emirates’ energy-diversification efforts, recently showed a visiting reporter one of his company’s showcase experiments: a desalination project on the Persian Gulf. Engineers are trying to harness the sun’s clean energy to transform seawater into drinking water — an energy-intensive process on which Gulf countries now expend large volumes of fossil fuels.

Although less than 1 percent of his country’s energy now comes from clean sources, Mr. Belhoul said he was optimistic that climate concerns, along with ever-improving alternative technologies, would enable the United Arab Emirates to meet their goal of 24 percent by 2021.

“Renewable energy is no longer an expensive alternative — it is becoming a technology of choice,” he said. “Climate change is no longer an academic debate. It’s a reality.”","Despite Climate Concerns, OPEC Plans to Keep Pumping Oil While It Can",2015-12-05,"Some members, including the United Arab Emirates, have acknowledged that they need to diversify and wean themselves from an oil-rich diet.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html

1114,"But the company announced it was scaling back share buybacks as cash flows tighten because of low oil and gas prices. Analysts estimated that Exxon buybacks would be a tenth what they were just four years ago, when energy prices were far higher. Not expecting a rebound in oil and gas prices anytime soon and trying to conserve cash, the company cut its spending in the quarter, reducing capital and exploration expenditures 12 percent to $16 billion.

“A second straight quarterly loss in the U.S. production segment was a surprise, given that oil prices were higher than the last quarter,” said Brian M. Youngberg, a senior energy analyst at Edward Jones.

Energy companies that have long been known for hefty profits are now forced to cut investments around the world. Rystad Energy, a consulting firm based in Norway, has estimated that the cuts will amount to $180 billion in 2015 alone. That has brought tens of thousands of job losses, which are beginning to hurt the economies of energy-rich states like Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas.

Some of the cuts in spending by Exxon, Chevron and other companies result from lower payments to service companies, which must lower their rates for well drilling and completions as exploration activity declines. Other cuts come in high-cost fields, like Canada’s oil sands and deepwater offshore projects. But Exxon and Chevron are still pressing ahead in promising oil and gas fields in several countries, including the United States and Australia.

Chevron’s net income fell severely in the second quarter to $571 million, from $5.67 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue fell to $40.4 billion, from nearly $58 billion a year ago. Over the first six months of the year, Chevron cut its capital and exploratory expenses to $17.3 billion, from $19.6 billion, over the first half of 2014.

Its oil and gas production businesses actually lost money, $2.22 billion, in contrast to earning more than $5 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company announced a write-down on assets of $1.96 billion. This week the company said it would cut 1,500 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $1 billion.

“Our upstream businesses were particularly hard hit,” said Chevron’s chief executive, John Watson, “as lower prices reduced revenues and triggered impairments and other charges.” He added, “Multiple efforts to improve future earnings and cash flows are underway.”

There was some good news in the Chevron results. Earnings from its refinery businesses, which make gasoline, lubricants, diesel and other refined products, were lifted by stronger margins to nearly $3 billion from $721 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, production of oil and gas was up 2 percent because of new or stepped-up operations in Argentina, Bangladesh and the Permian basin in West Texas.

Nevertheless, analysts expressed disappointment.

“Second-quarter earnings were lower than expected for both companies, a disappointment for Exxon and a disaster for Chevron,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. “Both lost money in the U.S., especially Chevron.”

The lower oil prices are helping consumers. The AAA motor club reported that gasoline prices are falling at the fastest rate since January, declining 16 days in a row for a total of 11 cents a gallon. The average price nationally for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $2.66, the lowest for this time of year since 2009.

Most energy analysts expect that oil prices will decline through at least the end of the year.

“Oil prices will be under downward pressure until there is evidence the glut is shrinking,” IHS Energy, a consultancy, projected in a report on Friday. “This will not happen quickly unless prices fall even further from recent levels.”

The IHS Energy report noted that global oil production had gone up, not down, this year because of production in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Together, they have increased their output by two million barrels a day, far outstripping demand. It further projected that oil prices would have to slide closer to $40 a barrel for several months before a decline in United States output would erode the global glut.

A $40 price would be ruinous for many small, independent oil companies operating in the shale fields of North Dakota and Texas, where break-even well costs average about $60 a barrel. The domestic rig count has already dropped roughly 60 percent, but it takes time before the output of new wells falls. Many of the small companies have remained solvent because they have price hedges on their output, but those hedges will begin to run out this year and next.

Some analysts, however, think prices could rebound. A Barclays report on Friday said the high output by several members of the OPEC cartel was not sustainable, and a drop in production and exports would help tighten the market. The report noted that pipeline disruptions tied to political violence in Iraq were already taking a toll. It also said that Iranian oil was not likely to be a significantly larger portion of the global market until at least the middle of 2016.

And perhaps most important, the Barclays report noted, “U.S. production will fall in 2016 if prices stay at these levels.”",Exxon and Chevron Report Worst Quarterly Results of Current Decade,2015-08-01,Declining oil and natural gas prices contributed to the companies’ disappointing second-quarter results.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-chevron-q2-earnings-oil-prices.html

This will be true when President Obama (or his successor) finally decides if the Keystone XL pipeline is in the national interest and it is certainly true today with Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic oil drilling effort after a test well sunk more than a mile below the sea floor was deemed a dud.

It’s good news for the Arctic environment, if not the company’s bottom line. The maritime Arctic is one of the last places to go to slake the country’s petroleum thirst given the lack of capacity for oversight and cleanups, even though a lot has been learned. (Of course there are plenty of other oil frontiers where similar vulnerabilities, ecological or social, exist.)

The potential environmental impacts had raised the project to the level of a campaign talking point, largely through ferocious criticism of President Obama from the left for approving it and inventive “#ShellNo” protests as the company deployed its vessels earlier this year:

Bye, bye @Shell. And don’t come back … #ShellNo #SavetheArctic http://t.co/EeCmz07ev0 — Save The Arctic (@savethearctic) 28 Sep 15

Still, while clearly a disappointment for Shell executives, this was just another day at the office in the always-risky global quest to profit from humanity’s 150-year-old oil habit.

The Wall Street Journal explained the finances this way:

Since 2007 Shell has spent roughly $7 billion in the Arctic, including $2.1 billion acquiring its licenses in the Chukchi Sea. Shell put the balance-sheet value of its offshore Alaska holdings at $3 billion, with a further $1.1 billion of future contractual commitments. That could translate into big write-downs when the company reports its third-quarter earnings, due Oct. 29. It is expected to repurpose some of the contracts for rigs and ships it has already paid for to other projects to help mitigate the financial impact, but the blow could be significant. Shell’s entire net profit in the second quarter this year was $3.4 billion. Though the company had high hopes for its exploration program in the Arctic, it always maintained that it would likely walk away if it failed to find oil this summer, even though the decision would be costly.

Environmental groups hailing the news were not quick to mention a role for low oil prices in contributing to the decision and Shell didn’t mention this in the statement announcing the decision to “cease further exploration activity in offshore Alaska for the foreseeable future.”

So I reached out to a few energy mavens to examine this subtext. I asked for help setting this write-off in the context of overall industry spending on exploration and production.

Citing an Oil & Gas Journal article, Michael Levi, the author of “The Power Surge” and a Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow, replied:

I don’t know exploration only. But combined exploration and production spending on oil and gas is on the order of $500 billion or more.

I also said the Shell news release cited “the high costs associated with the project and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska” but didn’t mention low oil prices. I noted that oil exploration is a “long game” gauged around the likelihood for rising demand in decades to come, but asked if they thought low prices (and projections for more of the same) played a role?

I included two Standard & Poors Dow Jones graphs that help tell the story.

Levi said low oil prices can affect a long-term exploration strategy simply by crimping cash flow:

Price has to be a factor at some level. In the long run, cost only matters relative to expected price. In the short run, cost matters relative to access to cash regardless of the expected price.

Daniel Yergin, author of “The Quest” and vice chairman of IHS, an energy consultancy, added these thoughts:

Price is centrally in the mind of every company now in every decision they make. Even before the price collapse, companies were becoming increasingly concerned about escalating upstream costs owing to the high demand for services. Over the last few months, a consensus has gelled that lower crude oil prices, if not these very low prices, will persist for a longer time, and that has led to significant cuts in spending – 30 to 50 percent for independent companies, and about 10 to 15 percent for the large companies. This particularly applies to big ticket earlier-stage exploration projects. So you’re seeing many delays and postponements – and some outright cancellations

For some overarching thoughts on oil demand now and in coming years I reached out to Vaclav Smil, the emeritus professor at the University of Manitoba who has run the numbers on just about every risk and resource question imaginable. His latest column in IEEE Spectrum describes how the oil intensity of the United States economy (oil use per unit of economic activity) has been halved since the 1970s.

First, he said, bluntly as always, no one should expect, or want, exploration to end any time soon:

This is a civilization built on oil. Why do people want to see its rapid demise? Do we have anything on the scale of 4 billion metric tons a year to replace it and do so in less than 20 to 25 years in order to drive, fly, fuel container and other ships, produce fertilizers and make plastics?

I noted that I agree with him on the time scale of energy transitions (which is why I’ve supported domestic drilling while we still use oil, rather than exporting the hazards to places less able or willing to safeguard lives and the environment). I asked him to weigh in on what seems to be an unbreakably perverse cycle of high prices driving overzealous exploration but also more fuel conservation, then low prices doing the opposite on both fronts.

Smil replied:

Unfortunately, such is the inherent idiocy of standard economic behavior, wall to wall: Low prices spur consumption, increased demand cannot keep up with “normal” investments, that leads to a mad rush for developing any half-plausible resource, prices spike, demand slackens. We have been through this, most violently, between 1978 and 1986, and three times since in smaller, shorter versions. The latest “down” could offer price stability for a decade as we had through the 1990s, or even longer, followed by the inevitable price rise. Classical liquid oil is steadily depleting, oil sands and fracking are slowing down, and a new relative shortage will arise, guaranteed. Being human, we will never learn and do it again.

1147,"The stock market edged a hair lower Wednesday, ending a four-day rally, as a drop in energy shares and anxiety over Greece outweighed encouraging earnings reports from banks.

Energy stocks slumped with the price of oil after a report showed that a drop in United States supplies last week was less than expected.

The market’s pause follows strong gains. Stocks have surged in the last week as a slump abated in China’s stock market and a deal was reached on a possible bailout for Greece.

Greece’s agreement with its creditors still requires approval by the country’s lawmakers. As investors waited for a vote in the nation’s Parliament, protesters in Athens clashed with police. The protesters want an end to the harsh austerity measures demanded by Greece’s creditors in exchange for more loans.

“You come in some days and it looks like it’s all clear and that Greece has been resolved, and the next day it hasn’t,” said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager with John Hancock Asset Management.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index edged down 1.55 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,107.40. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.41 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,050.17. The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,098.94.

The market started the day higher after encouraging second-quarter results from banks, including Bank of America. The bank said its profit more than doubled thanks to lower legal bills. It also said an increase in deposits, lower expenses and an improving balance sheet helped offset a decline in revenue.

Bank of America rose 55 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $17.68.

There was economic data to sift. The Federal Reserve said U.S. factory production was unchanged for a second straight month in June as a sharp drop in auto manufacturing was offset by greater output of furniture and chemicals.

The cutback in auto production comes after three months of healthy gains and is probably temporary. Still, manufacturers are struggling to overcome several challenges, including a strong dollar, weak overseas growth, and cheaper oil.

The Fed said that overall industrial production — which includes mining output and utilities, as well as manufacturing — rose 0.3 percent, the best showing since November. Mining, which includes oil and gas wells, rose 1 percent, as oil output increased. Utility output jumped 1.5 percent, the most since February, as people ramped up air conditioning in the summer.

Also Wednesday, the Labor Department said that its producer price index increased 0.4 percent in June, another sign that inflation remains tame.

Producer prices have fallen 0.7 percent over the past 12 months due to lower oil and gasoline costs. Core prices, which exclude energy and food, rose 0.3 percent in June.

Fed officials are monitoring measures of inflation as they weigh whether to raise a key short-term interest rate. The central bank’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, gave an indication of those plans Wednesday when she appeared before the House Financial Services Committee.

Ms. Yellen told Congress she saw encouraging signs that the economy was reviving after a harsh winter. If the improvements continue, she said, policy makers will most likely start raising interest rates later this year.

Freeport-McMoRan, the mining and energy company, said on Tuesday that it might separate its oil and gas unit. The announcement comes six weeks after the activist investor Carl C. Icahn disclosed an 8.5 percent stake in the company.

Freeport-McMoRan said that “following constructive discussions with many of its largest shareholders,” it was considering selling a minority interest in the oil and gas business through a public offering or spinning off the unit to shareholders. The company is also looking into joint ventures and ways to cut spending for the unit, it said.

Additionally, Freeport-McMoRan said it had reduced the board to nine members from 16.

Freeport-McMoRan’s stock price has tumbled nearly 52 percent so far this year as commodity prices have slumped. The company said in August that it would reduce production levels and expenditures to help weather the weakness in the markets.

The company, which says it is the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, plans to also focus on that commodity and reducing its debt load.

1167,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Islamic State fighters are preventing fuel shipments from reaching rebel-held parts of northern Syria, causing severe shortages that are grounding ambulances, paralyzing medical centers and shutting down bakeries, according to antigovernment activists and aid workers.

Adding to the misery, international aid groups said, the forces of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, are targeting medical centers in opposition areas, killing some workers and forcing facilities to shut down.

The fuel shortages highlight how more than four years of war in Syria have ravaged the economy and allowed the warring parties to use the country’s scarce resources as a vise to squeeze their enemies.

Since the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized oil-rich regions in Syria’s north and east, it has used the output to finance its efforts to build an Islamic caliphate that straddles the Syria-Iraq border.

Traders from elsewhere in Syria, such as the rebel-held regions in the northwest, have long bought locally refined petroleum products in Islamic State-controlled areas and trucked them home, where residents came to rely on them to power their cars and fuel generators that ran clinics, bakeries and other essential facilities.

But this month, the jihadists began barring fuel trucks from leaving their areas, activists, aid workers and truckers said.

“They are using fuel as a weapon,” said Dr. Khaled Almilaji, of the Canadian International Medical Relief Organization, which supports medical facilities in northern Syria.

The fuel embargo, Dr. Almilaji noted, comes as the Islamic State has been clashing with rebel groups as it seeks to expand in Aleppo Province. Dr. Almilaji said he presumed that the fuel cutoff was aimed at weakening the rebels to ease a jihadist advance.

But the cutoff has affected more than the rebels’ ability to fill up their trucks, he said. Clinics lacking electricity cannot treat the wounded, give dialysis or provide other essential services, the doctor said. Medical committees in Idlib and Hama Provinces have warned that they will have to shut down facilities soon if they do not receive fuel.

The shortages have also limited the movements of emergency medical workers in areas where the government frequently drops barrel bombs that destroy buildings and often leave civilians buried in the rubble.

“The most important thing is the ambulances and the civil defense trucks,” Dr. Almilaji said. “They cannot move in Aleppo and Idlib now, so if any barrel bombs are dropped, they can’t go dig the people out.”

Civilians across rebel-held parts of the northwest have described a mounting crisis as fuel supplies have dwindled, causing bakeries to cut production and grounding traders who move merchandise.

“For the time being, everything has stopped,” said an activist who would give only his first name, Hassan, adding that the price of a liter of gasoline, when available, had gone up fivefold.

A driver from the town of Jarjanaz said by phone that Islamic State fighters had stopped him at a checkpoint as he was leaving their area and forced him to abandon his tanker truck.

“They said it was not allowed,” the driver said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he works in Islamic State areas and feared retribution. “You can’t discuss with them. If they say it is not allowed, you have to obey.”

International aid groups sounded the alarm on Thursday about Syrian government attacks on medical facilities in opposition-controlled areas. Doctors Without Borders said that a hospital in Dara’a Province in the south had been destroyed after being struck by four barrel bombs this week.

The hospital was the only one in the province providing dialysis and neonatal care and has been closed indefinitely because of damage caused by the bombing, the group said in a statement.

Also on Thursday, Physicians for Human Rights said that May had been the worst month for attacks on health care facilities since the start of the conflict in March 2011, with 14 centers attacked and 10 medical workers killed.

LONDON — Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday that its profit fell sharply in the second quarter as a strong performance in marketing and refining failed to offset the brunt of lower oil and gas prices.

The oil giant also said it would cut its capital investment and eliminate 6,500 jobs as the drop in oil and gas prices squeezes its vast global exploration and production operations.

The company, based in The Hague, said earnings adjusted for inventory changes and excluding one-time items were $3.8 billion, compared with $6.1 billion in the period in 2014.

Ben van Beurden, the company’s chief executive, justified Shell’s plans for exploratory drilling in the Arctic waters off Alaska this summer, despite strong opposition from environmental groups, citing the potential to increase company reserves greatly. He told reporters here that the oil field “has the potential to be multiple times larger than the largest prospects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, so it’s huge.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. van Beurden said that if Shell did find oil and an acceptable way to develop it, production would not begin until 2030 because of the complexities of Arctic operations.

The company earned $1 billion in the quarter from oil and gas exploration and production, compared with $4.7 billion a year earlier. Its average revenue from a barrel of oil was 48 percent lower for the quarter than a year earlier, while those from natural gas, an important earner for Shell, fell 31 percent.

Shell executives indicated that they were preparing for what could be a long period of low oil prices.

The company also appeared to try to allay fears among some investors that the $70 billion acquisition of the BG Group, the British oil and gas producer, could prove ill-timed. In April, Shell agreed to buy BG, which was once part of British Gas and is a major player in liquefied natural gas.

“We will reshape the company once this transaction is complete,” Mr. van Beurden said in a statement.

He said that the BG acquisition, which brings promising development prospects in Brazil and elsewhere, would allow Shell to cut exploration spending and would lead to wide-ranging asset sales of $30 billion from 2016 to 2018.

Shell said it had already established a team with BG to plan the integration of the two companies once the deal closed in early 2016.

Shell’s stock price rose 4 percent on Thursday, but it was still down more than 10 percent since the announcement of the BG acquisition.

As part of its cost cutting, Shell said it anticipated 6,500 staff and contractor reductions this year. Capital investment in 2015 will be $30 billion, $7 billion lower than last year, the company said.

Shell’s profit decline is in line with the rest of the industry, which is suffering from a roughly 50 percent decline in oil prices over the last year. ConocoPhillips reported on Thursday a net loss for the second quarter of $179 million, compared with a gain of $2.1 billion for the quarter last year. The loss included a deferred Canadian tax charge. The company, based in Houston, said it would cut $500 million more from its capital budget, to $11 billion.

Chevron announced this week that it would cut 1,500 jobs in the coming months.

Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, said Shell’s comments on Thursday would most likely be “taken positively” by investors, who had been uneasy about the BG transaction as well as Shell’s efforts to drill off Alaska.

Shell has invested more than $7 billion over the last seven years to explore for oil in the Alaskan Arctic, when most other companies have given up or at least suspended their operations in the region. With oil prices plummeting to about $54 a barrel from nearly $110 last summer, Shell’s effort in Alaska has appeared all the more risky in terms of costs.

But after years of frustrating accidents and regulatory delays, the company has two floating rigs in the Chukchi Sea ready to explore what Shell geologists say they believe is a major new oil field.

Environmentalists have dogged Shell’s latest efforts, with kayakers in the port of Seattle trying to block drilling ships. This week, a few dozen protesters rappelled off a bridge to block an icebreaking vessel trying to leave Portland, Ore., after repairs.

Once the icebreaker reaches the Chukchi Sea in mid-August, Shell will seek final permission from federal regulators to drill in oil-bearing zones. But even if drilling is approved, Shell acknowledged, there is likely to be enough time to drill only one well before the sea freezes, and a single well will not be sufficient to determine how much oil is there.

But for all the hurdles, Mr. van Beurden gave a stirring defense of the company’s Arctic efforts.

“Alaska is a long-term play. That is the way you have to look at it,” he said. “Of course, you can decide to walk away from it, but this is a play that will work for us.”","Royal Dutch Shell Profits Continue to Fall, Prompting Layoffs",2015-07-31,"The company said the drop in oil and gas prices was squeezing it, as ConocoPhillips also reported a loss.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-earnings-q2.html

1171,"With oil prices so low, it’s tempting to say the worst is over, as many hedge fund managers did earlier in 2015, only to get burned. But Damien Courvalin, senior strategist in the Global Investment Research Commodities team at Goldman Sachs, told me this week that it was too soon for the all-clear signal. While Goldman expects oil prices to recover eventually, even by late 2016, over the near term the same forces that drove prices to new lows in the last year, starting with oversupply, shadow the market. Goldman’s three-month forecast for oil prices is $38, about where they are now, but they could go as low as $20, Mr. Courvalin suggested.

“We’re more concerned about the downside risks than the upside potential at this point,” he said. “People keep asking if it’s time to get excited about energy, but we believe that conversation is premature.”

In theory, slumping prices, and the resulting financial stress for marginal producers, should lead to cutbacks in production. There have been some, “but supply has proven surprisingly resilient,” Mr. Courvalin said. After a long period of capital investment driven by high prices for oil and other commodities, many production facilities are only now coming on line, “and they’re going to produce, no matter what the price,” Mr. Courvalin said.

He compared recent oil price moves to the period from 1976 to 1989. After peaking in 1980, oil prices fell through much of the ‘80s, finally bottoming in 1988. So far, the current period, beginning in 2005, looks similar. If the pattern continues — a big if — a recovery should begin by 2018, which is still two years away. “It could even be another decade,” Mr. Courvalin said, “before prices sustainably return to the levels of the past few years.”

For insights into global stock markets, I turned to two of the year’s most successful fund managers, Kristian Heugh at Morgan Stanley and David Nadel at the Royce Funds. Each has the distinction of managing funds ranked No. 1 in their categories for 2015 by Morningstar.

Mr. Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, manages the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Global Opportunity Portfolio, which gained over 20 percent in 2015. Mr. Nadel is senior portfolio manager in New York for Royce’s International Premier Investment Fund, which gained over 17 percent in 2015, and the Royce European Small-Cap Fund, up nearly 14 percent.

Both managers invest in relatively concentrated portfolios, by fund standards, that don’t closely track broad indexes, which helped them outperform their respective indexes in the last year by a large margin. And both avoided the energy sector. Mr. Heugh’s largest holdings as of November were Facebook, the software concern Epam Systems and Amazon. Mr. Nadel’s were VZ Holding, a Swiss financial services company; Clarkson P.L.C., a shipping firm based in London, and Bajaj Finance in India.

“They’re boring companies,” Mr. Nadel said, reflecting his investment philosophy, which focuses on companies that meet a modified version of the “five forces” that determine the long-run profitability of businesses, as developed by the Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter. “But boring can be beautiful.”

Several money managers are predicting another flat-to-down year for United States equities for the same reasons stocks were flat in 2015 — high valuations, expectations of rising interest rates, a strong dollar and continued weak oil and commodity prices.

But both Mr. Heugh and Mr. Nadel see future opportunities in international stocks. “The U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world for quite a few years now, and the strong dollar has been exacerbating this trend,” Mr. Heugh said. “These cycles tend to reverse themselves over time, sometimes violently.”

He sees many opportunities in Asia, including China, which he notes is still growing, even if at a slower pace. “Asia is trading at a discount to its historical multiples of free cash flow and earnings, while the U.S. and Europe are trading at premiums,” he said.

But Mr. Heugh focuses more on fundamental stock analysis and less on broad geographic or macroeconomic forces. He said he looked for high-quality companies with competitive advantages that deter potential competitors. Then, “it doesn’t matter which region outperforms in a given year or three- or five-year period, you will become partners in great businesses and have the potential to benefit as partners over time.”

Photo

Mr. Nadel said he also looked for stocks of international companies that benefit from high barriers to entry. “I’m not big on predictions, but the stage is set nicely for investing internationally,” he said. While the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has risen 75 percent over the last five years, international small-cap indexes have contracted slightly. “Dividend yields are over twice as generous outside the U.S.,” he said. “I think in 2016 we could see some catch-up.”

He especially likes some companies based in India, a country with “some of the best 10-year prospects in the world,” and Brazil, whose market “has to have hit rock bottom — at least, I hope so.” He said he was “cautiously optimistic” about the prospects for emerging markets. He praised structural reforms in Japan and said a wave of immigration should eventually benefit developed European economies.

The long bull market in bonds sputtered in 2015, as the Fed finally raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter point for the first time since 2006. United States Treasuries and most investment-grade corporate bonds barely eked out positive returns, and junk bonds plunged in a panicky sell-off late in the year.

Travis King, head of investment-grade credit at Voya Investment Management in New York, managed a 1.3 percent return for the Voya Investment Grade Credit Fund. While modest, that was better than most fixed-income funds, and Morningstar has ranked his fund the No. 1 corporate bond fund over the most recent three-year period. Mr. King said that even with the Fed expected to continue a slow but steady rise in interest rates, he anticipated modest positive returns again in 2016.

“Our market view is for a slow and gradual rise in the Fed funds rate, with Japanese and European rates staying very low,” Mr. King said. “In that environment, we think corporate bonds will be a winning trade, but you have to be selective.” In 2015, his fund rotated toward bonds from money center banks and other financial concerns, which helped it outperform its benchmark. He said he expected to continue that emphasis in 2016. “We think financials are still a good place to be overweight,” Mr. King said.

As for junk bonds, he said he thought that the worst of the sell-off might have run its course.

“Yields are starting to push 9 percent,” he said. “People are still avoiding high-yield debt from the energy sector, but elsewhere you’re seeing some stability. In a world where the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.25 percent, 8 percent or 9 percent starts to look pretty interesting.”","After a Tumultuous Year for Investors, the Experts Look Ahead",2016-01-01,Turning to some of 2015’s most successful investors and analysts for an annual look at what to expect next year.,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/01/business/after-a-tumultuous-year-for-investors-the-experts-look-ahead.html

1188,"Salaries are stagnant, while recent studies show that inequality and poverty have increased over the past few years.

Now, just when Mexico might have begun to see the first concrete benefits of the economic revisions, the economy is being pummeled by forces beyond the government’s control as global financial uncertainty mounts.

The peak of the wave of constitutional changes that Mr. Peña Nieto maneuvered through a divided Congress in his first three years was opening the oil, gas and electricity industry to private investment, reversing the nationalization of the country’s oil industry 75 years ago.

The timing could not have been worse. The collapse in oil prices all but halted the predicted rush by international oil companies into Mexico and will force the government, which relies on oil revenue to fund at least a third of its spending, to make significant cuts in social and infrastructure programs next year.

The first auction for offshore oil exploration blocks in July drew so few bids that only two of the 14 on offer were awarded. Regulators have relaxed the conditions for coming bids, but the billions in investment that the government promised seem even further off.

“Energy reforms are going to kick in some time in the future,” said Gabriel Casillas, chief economist at Banorte Financial Group, a large Mexican bank. “It’s going to take longer, 15 years, not by 2017 or 2018 as we thought.”

In addition, the peso’s slide over the past year — along with the fall of currencies in other emerging markets — has raised the price of imports from the United States about 30 percent. That upends business investment plans and makes consumers nervous about big purchases.

There are bright spots. Prudent economic management over the years has kept inflation under control and debt in check. About $20 billion in foreign investment has poured into the Mexican auto industry over the past six years to take advantage of Mexico’s proximity to the United States, its trade agreements and its skilled labor force.

The results, though, are pockets of success in the highly efficient export sector that have failed to reach those on lower rungs of the economic ladder.

“These policies have delivered stability, they haven’t delivered growth,” said Joydeep Mukherji, a managing director at Standard & Poor’s who follows Mexico closely.

“There is a general negativeness in the air for many, many reasons,” Mr. Mukherji added. “That’s the hardest thing to turn around because you have to boost the confidence of investors and consumers. It requires political leadership and a different set of skills than passing a law.”

There are other problems that weigh on the economy. Citing measurements from Mexico’s national statistics institute, Alonso Cervera, the chief Latin America economist at Credit Suisse, estimated that crime cuts a full percentage point off Mexican growth.

“The economic reforms were very powerful and very forceful,” Mr. Cervera said. “I would have liked to see the same forcefulness on judicial reform. Crime and corruption have to be punished.”

Business leaders argue that preaching patience is no longer enough.

Along with opening up the energy sector, the economic changes closed tax loopholes, gave new powers to antitrust regulators, set up special rules to weaken telecommunications monopolies, encouraged banks to lend to small businesses, and gave employers new flexibility to hire and fire workers. But businesses argue that the economy now needs incentives for investment and job creation.

Analysts argue that Mr. Peña Nieto’s government failed to invest during his first two years in office — when high oil prices gave finance officials much more room to maneuver than they have now — and lost a valuable opportunity.

“Instead of building a bridge, they put money in accounts,” said Mr. Casillas of Banorte. “They earmarked money, but it was never used.”

Others say the main diagnosis of Mexico’s ailment was wrong.

“The reforms were oversold,” said Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at the Colegio de México and the author of a recent study for Oxfam that found that the country’s already vast inequality was growing.

The government thought “that the energy issue was the solution to the country’s problems,” he said. “All sectors need to grow. It won’t drag up the rest of the economy.”

The government points to an increase of 1.4 million workers during the last two years who are affiliated with Mexico’s Social Security Institute, a measure of formal employment and an indicator of success. But 60 percent of the population still works in the informal sector in jobs such as taxi drivers or street vendors, most of them barely scraping by. Almost 42 percent of workers cannot afford to meet their basic needs with their salary alone, according to one think tank, Mexico Como Vamos, a figure that is about the same as it was when Mr. Peña Nieto took office.

“Low salaries are a fundamental part of the economy,” Mr. Esquivel said. “A good part of the economy has no purchasing power.”

Luis Foncerrada, the director of the Center for Economic Studies of the Private Sector, a think tank affiliated with Mexico’s main business alliance, argues that overall salaries have been depressed because 21 percent of the work force is either unemployed or working just a few hours a week.

“It’s naïve to sit here with our arms crossed waiting for the reforms to have results,” he said. “It’s like telling somebody who is sick to wait five years for the cure to appear.”",Pessimism Pervades Mexico as Economic Promises Fall Short,2015-09-02,"As Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to reboot his presidency, the Mexican economy is being pummeled by forces beyond the government’s control.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/world/americas/mexicans-remain-pessimistic-on-economy-despite-signs-of-progress.html

TERIBERKA, Russia — The warming Arctic should already have transformed this impoverished fishing village on the coast of the Barents Sea.

The Kremlin spent billions in the last decade in hopes of turning it into a northern hub of its energy powerhouse, Gazprom. It was once the most ambitious project planned in the Arctic Ocean, but now there is little to show for it aside from a shuttered headquarters and an enormous gravel road carved out of the windblown coastline like a scar.

“There are plans,” said Viktor A. Turchaninov, the village’s mayor, “but the facts — the realities of life — suggest the opposite.”

The dream of an Arctic Klondike, made possible by the rapid warming of once-icebound waters, has been at the core of Russia’s national ambitions and those of the world’s biggest energy companies for more than a decade. But even as Royal Dutch Shell began drilling an exploratory well this summer off the north coast of Alaska, Russia’s experiences here have become a cautionary tale, one that illustrates the challenges facing those imagining that a changing Arctic will produce oil and gas riches.

Tectonic shifts in the global energy economy, fierce opposition from environmentalists who oppose tampering with the ecologically fragile waters, and formidable logistical obstacles have tempered enthusiasm that only a few years ago seemed boundless. After years of planning and delays, Shell’s drilling project in the stormy waters of the Chukchi Sea is now being watched by the industry, officials, residents and critics as a make-or-break test of the viability of production in the Arctic.

“From an economic point of view, I’m not sure going offshore Arctic is very rational,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive and president of Total, the French oil company, which once also planned to drill off Alaska’s northern coast.

Shell has already spent $7 billion and this summer has faced tribulations like those that marred an ill-fated exploration three years ago, including dogged protests, harsh weather and an accident in July that gouged a hole in one of its ships after it struck an uncharted shoal in the Aleutian Islands.

Only seven years ago, Shell and other companies — ConocoPhillips, Statoil of Norway, Repsol of Spain and Eni of Italy — together paid $2.7 billion for leases for the fields off Alaska. The price of oil at the time climbed to nearly $150 a barrel, and the accelerated reduction of ice that once choked the Arctic Ocean seemed to make exploration easier.

Then the market changed. The world today is awash in oil and natural gas, largely because of the shale revolution in the United States and the advent of hydraulic fracturing, which has so increased production that the United States has slashed imports. Saudi Arabia and other states around the Persian Gulf are producing at maximum levels, and if the nuclear agreement with Iran gets final approval and economic sanctions are lifted, Iran’s reserves could soon flood the market. In the last year alone, the price of oil has plummeted to less than $50 a barrel from more than $90.

Across the Arctic, from Russia to Norway to Canada, offshore projects have already proved disappointing. After drilling eight exploratory wells off Greenland in 2011 and 2012, Cairn Energy, a Scottish company, abandoned them. Chevron shelved exploration in the Canadian waters of the Beaufort Sea last December, followed in June by a consortium including ExxonMobil and BP.

American sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year forced ExxonMobil to withdraw from a joint venture in the Kara Sea with the state-owned oil giant Rosneft, which has had to suspend its drilling plans there as it searches for new partners.

“When we look at Arctic opportunities, they are always the opportunities that are 10 years away,” said Kenneth B. Medlock III, director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University.

The difficulties of getting oil and gas out of the Arctic are daunting. Winters are long and dark, and the Arctic seas, despite reductions in the permanent ice pack, are still clogged with floes and icebergs, while intensifying storms have threatened ships or oil rigs even during the summer. Marshy tundra onshore complicates the construction of pipelines and support facilities. So do coastal erosion and melting permafrost.

There are few roads or airports, or people for that matter, near the areas to be drilled, requiring workers and equipment to be shipped long distances. Despite agreements by the Arctic Council, an international organization that includes the United States, Russia and six other Arctic countries, few resources are available for search and rescue or the cleanup of oil in icy conditions. That, along with strict requirements imposed by the Obama administration, forced Shell to send a flotilla of more than two dozen ships to the Chukchi Sea this summer.

“The entire cost structure up there is three to five times more expensive than onshore lower 48,” said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a Texas-based oil company. Two years ago, his company gave up on a field projected to contain 100 million barrels of oil in the Beaufort Sea — drilled from a man-made island and connected by an eight-mile pipeline to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska — in order to invest more in Texas shale fields.",Melting Ice Isn’t Opening Arctic to Oil Bonanza,2015-09-08,"The region remains inhospitable for drilling, while environmental concerns, a sagging market and sanctions against Russia also have impeded plans.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/world/europe/melting-ice-isnt-opening-arctic-to-oil-bonanza.html

Diesel automobiles, which are more fuel-efficient than their gasoline-powered counterparts, were always supposed to shield their owners from some of the impact of oil-price spikes.

All told, roughly 20 percent of new cars sold around the world are diesel-powered. Diesel accounts for about half of new passenger vehicles sold in Europe and India, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. It reaches double-digit penetration rates in a small number of other major markets, such as Australia and South Korea, but barely more than 1 or 2 percent in the United States, China and Japan.

But in fact emissions were always the real issue with diesel. Progress has been made in reducing the sulfur content of diesel fuel, the chief culprit in soot emissions. But the higher compression of diesel engines and the less refined nature of the fuel, compared to gasoline, ensure that diesel cars produce more of several pollutants, including nitrogen compounds, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and dioxide.

The emissions issue was brought to the fore when Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker and No.2 in the world (after Toyota), acknowledged in September that it had fiddled with 11 million of its diesel-powered cars to make them appear to meet emissions standards.

Subsequent press reports indicated that diesel cars produced by other companies violated European emissions targets, but this was generally attributed to the way tests are conducted — the cars generate fewer emissions in the lab than on the road — and not to wrongdoing.

To compensate for the pollution levels, diesel emission-control systems are more complex and costly. It is thought that Volkswagen manipulated the software in its cars to show false readings because a pollution-control system able to meet American emissions requirements, which are stricter than Europe’s, would have been prohibitively expensive.

Apart from the dishonesty, the scandal suggests that diesel technology is less clean and less cost-effective than advocates assert. Even before the story broke, diesel had several factors going against it, including declining crude-oil prices, improvements in gasoline engines and technologies that produce cleaner cars.

“Diesel probably doesn’t make sense for light-duty vehicles,” said Daniel Sperling, a professor of civil engineering and environmental science and policy at the University of California’s Davis campus and director of the Institute of Transportation Studies there. Other types of cars “are more efficient,” he said. “Emission standards are getting tighter and tighter, and as the shift takes place to electric, diesel does not have a promising long-term future” in passenger cars.

David Keith, assistant professor of system dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered a similar prognosis. “There’s a strong headwind for diesel in the passenger-vehicle market,” he said. “Emission regulations support alternatives.”

All things considered, the costs of diesel and gasoline cars are comparable. Because they have to run hotter, diesel engines must be built sturdier. Between the engines and emission-control systems, the cars are pricier, but they tend to stay on the road longer.

Diesel cars have been popular in Europe because diesel fuel is subsidized there and because emission standards are lower than for gas-powered cars. Regulators in the United States require both types to meet the same standards, which raises costs for diesel cars made for the American market, said Mr. Sperling, who also serves on the California Air Resources Board.

But Europe is introducing tougher emissions standards, which could require more expensive control systems in diesel cars. And after the Volkswagen affair, testing is likely to get tougher, too, said Colin Langan, who follows the auto industry for the Swiss bank UBS.

At the same time, improvements to gas engines could make them more appealing. “In Europe, a lot of people have assumed that diesel was going to lose momentum,” Mr. Langan said. “Gas engines are getting a lot better; they’re getting turbochargers, which diesel engines already have. People are going to start migrating more to gas from diesel.”

He added, however, that Europe has also set tougher fuel-economy targets for carmakers. Diesel still has an edge there, which may slow the shift to gas.

Gasoline-powered cars are not the only ones that makers of diesel cars have to worry about. Coming up in the fast lane, even if there’s little traffic there now, are hybrid and electric vehicles.

Mr. Langan sees little threat from the cleaner alternatives just yet, however, because they are more expensive than gas or diesel models. Electric works at the upscale, high-performance end of the market, where manufacturers like Tesla live, but not in the mainstream.

Alan Baum, principal of Baum and Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Michigan, is more hopeful.

“Costs are coming down and the technology is improving” amid “an all-hands-on-deck strategy among regulators and automakers,” Mr. Baum said. Internal-combustion vehicles are less expensive than electric and hybrid equivalents today, but he wonders what the cost might be “when you have to have a car that gets 30 miles per gallon or, in 10 years, 40?”

As a result of the various threats to its position in the marketplace — both external and self-inflicted — diesel’s proportion of the world’s fleet of passenger cars is likely to shrink into the teens in the next decade, Mr. Baum forecast.

Mr. Keith at M.I.T. similarly highlighted “the great scope for innovation to introduce electric-drive technology that promises to be cleaner.”

“I don’t think diesel’s going to go away completely,” he added. “I think there’s a role for all these technologies, but definitely in the U.S. and increasingly in Europe, we can see challenges in getting diesel to perform at a level we like.”",The Dimming of Diesel Fuel’s Future in Cars,2015-12-09,"Even before the Volkswagen scandal, diesel had several factors going against it, including lower oil prices, improvements in gasoline engines and technologies that produce cleaner vehicles.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/business/energy-environment/the-dimming-of-diesel-fuels-future-in-cars.html

1237,"Decades of cooperation in the Arctic Council, which includes Russia, the United States and six other Arctic states, all but ended with Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing war in eastern Ukraine. In March, Russia conducted an unannounced military exercise that was one of the largest ever in the far north. It involved 45,000 troops, as well as dozens of ships and submarines, including those in its strategic nuclear arsenal, from the Northern Fleet, based in Murmansk.

The first of two new army brigades — each expected to grow to more than 3,600 soldiers — deployed to a military base only 30 miles from the Finnish border. The other will be deployed on the Yamal Peninsula, where many of Russia’s new investments in energy resources on shore are. Mr. Putin has pursued the buildup as if a 2013 protest by Greenpeace International at the site of Russia’s first offshore oil platform above the Arctic Circle was the vanguard of a more ominous invader.

“Oil and gas production facilities, loading terminals and pipelines should be reliably protected from terrorists and other potential threats,” Mr. Putin said when detailing the military buildup last year. “Nothing can be treated as trivial here.”

In Washington and other NATO capitals, Russia’s military moves are seen as provocative — and potentially destabilizing.

In the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, Russia has intensified air patrols probing NATO’s borders, including in the Arctic. In February, Norwegian fighter jets intercepted six Russian aircraft off Norway’s northern tip. Similar Russian flights occurred last year off Alaska and in the Beaufort Sea, prompting American and Canadian jets to intercept them. Russia’s naval forces have also increased patrols, venturing farther into Arctic waters. Of particular concern, officials said, has been Russia’s deployment of air defenses in the far north, including surface-to-air missiles whose main purpose is to counter aerial incursions that only the United States or NATO members could conceivably carry out in the Arctic.

“We see the Arctic as a global commons,” a senior Obama administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters of national security. “It’s not apparent the Russians see it the same way we do.”

Russia has also sought to assert its sovereignty in the Arctic through diplomacy. This month, Russia resubmitted a claim to the United Nations to a vast area of the Arctic Ocean — 463,000 square miles, about the size of South Africa — based on the geological extension of its continental shelf.

The commission that reviews claims under the Convention on the Law of the Sea rejected a similar one filed in 2001, citing insufficient scientific evidence. But Russia, along with Canada and Denmark (through its administration of Greenland), have pressed ahead with competing stakes. Russia signaled its ambitions — symbolically at least — as early as 2007 when it sent two submersibles 14,000 feet down to seabed beneath the North Pole and planted a titanium Russian flag.

Although the commission might not rule for years, Russia’s move underscored the priority the Kremlin has given to expanding its sovereignty. The United States, by contrast, has not even ratified the law of the sea treaty, leaving it on the sidelines of territorial jockeying.

“Nobody cared too much about these sectors,” said Andrei A. Smirnov, deputy director for operations at Atomflot, which operates Russia’s fleet of six nuclear-powered icebreakers, “but when it turned out that 40 percent of confirmed oil and gas deposits were there, everybody became interested in who owns what.”

Some have questioned whether Russia, whose economy is sinking under the weight of sanctions and the falling price of oil, can sustain its efforts in the Arctic.

“It is rather difficult to find rationale for this very pronounced priority in the allocation of increasingly scarce resources,” said Pavel K. Baev of the Peace Research Institute Oslo. He added that Russian claims that it was protecting its economic interests from NATO were “entirely fictitious.”

“The only challenge to Russian exploitation of the Arctic came from Greenpeace,” he said.

American commanders are watching warily. The United States and its NATO allies still have significant military forces — including missile defenses and plenty of air power — in the Arctic, but the Army is considering reducing its two brigades in Alaska. The Navy, which has no ice-capable warships, acknowledged in a report last year that it had little experience operating in the Arctic Ocean, notwithstanding decades of submarine operations during the Cold War. While it saw little need for new assets immediately, it predicted that could change.

Adm. William E. Gortney, head of the Pentagon’s Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said that Russia was increasing its capabilities after years of neglect but did not represent a meaningful threat, yet. “We’re seeing activity in the Arctic, but it hasn’t manifested in significant change at this point,” he said in a recent interview.

Despite concerns over the military buildup, others said that some of Russia’s moves were benign efforts to ensure the safety of ships on its Northern Sea Route, which could slash the time it takes to ship goods from Asia to Europe. Russia had pledged to take those steps as an Arctic Council member.

“Some of the things I see them doing — in terms of building up bases, telecommunications, search and rescue capabilities — are things I wish the United States was doing as well,” said Robert J. Papp Jr., a retired admiral and former commandant of the Coast Guard. He is now the State Department’s senior envoy on Arctic issues.

Less Ice, More Traffic

Aboard the Alex Haley, the crew made contact with each of the ships it encountered plowing the waters, recording details of the owners, courses and the number of crew members who might need to be plucked from the sea in case of disaster.

The cutter’s captain, Cmdr. Seth J. Denning, was a young ensign when he first crossed the Arctic Circle just north of the Bering Strait 19 years ago. “I never really realized that the Arctic was going to open up as much as it has — enough to allow this much activity,” he said. “I think it surprised many people.”

What had been a brief excursion for Ensign Denning when the Arctic was choked with ice has now become routine.

The Alex Haley — named after the author of “Roots,” who was a 20-year Coast Guard veteran — is one of five ships that the Coast Guard is deploying to the Arctic from June to October. It will be replaced by an advanced cutter, the Waesche, based in Alameda, Calif. The Coast Guard has also stationed two rescue helicopters at the airport at Deadhorse, the town where the Trans-Alaska Pipeline begins.

The deployments are part of an annual summer surge that was started in 2012 when Shell first explored the oil fields off Alaska’s North Slope. The challenges of the new mission have been exacting, given the vast distances and limited support infrastructure on land. For several days this month the Alex Haley’s only helicopter, which operates from a retractable hangar on the ship’s aft was out of service, awaiting a spare part that had to be flown in on several hops from North Carolina.

This year’s deployments are intended to assess the requirements for operating in the Arctic, but the expected increase in human activity there will put new demands on the service.

The House of Representatives voted on Friday to reverse a 40-year-old ban on oil exports, giving major oil companies a political victory at a time when they are suffering from lower oil prices and falling profits.

The House vote of 261-159 included 26 Democrats in favor of the legislation. But even though the legislation has gained momentum in recent weeks, it continues to face a major challenge in the Senate as well as the threat of a White House veto.

Still, the House vote makes it more likely that the export ban, which was enacted in the 1970s when the American economy was threatened by international oil embargoes and falling domestic production, will become an important issue in the presidential election campaign.

Jack N. Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, praised the bill as a job creator. “American producers would be able to compete on a level playing field with countries like Iran and Russia, providing security to our allies and accelerating the energy revolution that has revitalized our economy,” he said.

Opponents say lifting the export ban could raise gasoline prices, an assertion contested by many energy experts and economists since increased United States supplies on world markets could bring global prices down at least a bit. Others, including Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, say the immediate impact of lifting of ban would be limited since the global oil markets are currently glutted.

“Every American household is saving $700 or more this year from lower fuel prices because refiners are passing on savings to U.S. consumers,” said Jay Hauck, executive director the Crude Coalition, a lobbying group led by several refiners who profit from the low price of domestic oil, which is their principal raw material.

The Obama administration has been tinkering with the ban, and it recently gave oil companies temporary permission to export a limited amount of oil to Mexico. The administration has also allowed the export of a limited amount of extra-light oil, which comes out of the shale fields of Texas and several other states.

The Obama administration has been reluctant to lift the export ban entirely, in part because environmentalists say it would encourage more petroleum development and hydraulic fracturing at a time when the nation should be moving away from fossil fuels to curb climate change.

1250,"The price of imports in the United States fell in October as the cost of petroleum and a range of goods declined, indicating that a strong dollar and soft global demand continued to exert downward pressure on imported inflation.

Other data on Tuesday showed a surprise increase in wholesale inventories in September, suggesting that the slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter was not as abrupt as initially believed.

The Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.5 percent last month after declining 0.6 percent in September.

Import prices have now fallen in 14 of the last 16 months. Imported petroleum prices fell 2.1 percent after slipping 6 percent in September.

“We believe that weakness in emerging Asia, especially China, is likely to push down import prices over and above any effect from the appreciation of the dollar,” said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays.

In the 12 months through October, prices of imports tumbled 10.5 percent. The robust dollar and a sharp decline in oil prices have weighed on overall inflation, which is persistently running below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.

Weak inflation pressures, however, are unlikely to deter the Fed from raising its benchmark interest rate next month after job growth surged in October and the unemployment rate fell to a seven-and-a-half-year low of 5 percent.

A tightening labor market could give Fed officials confidence that inflation would gradually move toward its target.

A Reuters survey of over 80 leading economists published on Tuesday showed a 70 percent median chance the Fed would raise its benchmark overnight interest rate at its Dec. 15-16 policy meeting.

The dollar has gained 16.6 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014. Its impact on inflation was underscored by a 0.4 percent drop in import prices excluding petroleum last month, the largest decrease since January.

On Tuesday, the dollar rose to a fresh seven-month high against a basket of currencies as traders anticipated the first interest rate increase from the Fed in nearly a decade.

In a separate report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.5 percent as increases in automobiles, furniture, farm products and apparel offset declines in machinery, petroleum and a range of other goods.

Wholesale stocks rose 0.3 percent in August.

Inventories are a crucial component of revisions in the gross domestic product. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of G.D.P. — wholesale stocks excluding autos — increased 0.5 percent.

That is more than the government estimated in its advance G.D.P. estimate, which showed that inventories sliced off 1.44 percentage points from growth in the third quarter, leaving output expanding at a 1.5 percent annual rate.

As result, economists expect that third-quarter growth could be revised up to as high as a 1.9 percent rate later this month.

“The third-quarter inventory correction now looks less severe than we had previously believed,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.","Import Prices Fall on Weakness in Oil, and Wholesale Inventories Show Gains",2015-11-11,The Labor Department said import prices fell 0.5 percent last month after declining 0.6 percent in September.

1251,"Valeant stock has since tumbled. The hedge fund darling has become the target of several prominent short-sellers, one of whom called Valeant the next Enron. At the center of the claims is a specialty pharmacy called Philidor Rx Services, which reportedly used improper sales tactics — including changing doctors’ prescription orders — to secure payment for Valeant products from health insurers. Although Valeant employees are said to have worked at Philidor’s offices since the company’s early years, and even though Valeant paid $100 million for an option to purchase Philidor for $0, the company insists it does not control the pharmacy and is not liable for its misdeeds. Last Friday, after a week of scrutiny from regulators, journalists and short-sellers, Valeant announced it would sever ties with Philidor, forcing the pharmacy to cease operations.

When Philidor is banished to the ranks of extinct businesses, it will join a company called the American Express Field Warehousing Corporation. The warehousing subsidiary of American Express collapsed after it unwittingly guaranteed the soybean oil inventory of Anthony De Angelis, whose background was so shady that his business could not even open a regular bank account. The scandal blew up in spectacular fashion in 1963, when Mr. De Angelis used warehouse receipts stamped with the American Express guarantee to open margin-trading accounts in a reckless attempt to corner the market in soybean oil. When Mr. DeAngelis’s trade turned against him, it sank a brokerage firm with 20,000 customers holding half a billion dollars of stocks, and shut down the Produce Exchange for an entire day.

American Express was far from blameless in the scandal. An anonymous tipster explained Mr. De Angelis’s swindle to the company in 1960, including his method for filling tanks with seawater except for a narrow chamber of oil positioned under the measuring hatch. The accusations were largely ignored, and the fraud grew tenfold over the following three years, until American Express had guaranteed more soybean oil than actually existed in the entire country.

After Mr. De Angelis’s empire collapsed, American Express was left with scores of angry creditors demanding payment. Because the field warehousing business was housed in a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Mr. Clark, the American Express chief executive, could have let the unit fail and ignore the liabilities. In a decision that activist shareholders would later sue the company over, Mr. Clark announced that American Express felt morally bound to honor the liabilities. The company settled with soybean oil claimants, the stock recovered and resumed its upward climb, and Mr. Clark credited the scandal with injecting new life into his employees.

The difference between American Express after the salad oil swindle and Valeant Pharmaceuticals is bigger than Mr. Pearson’s refusal to assume financial responsibility for Philidor’s actions. Whereas American Express’s field warehousing business had nothing to do with the company’s rapidly growing credit card and its dominant traveler’s checks franchise, Philidor and other specialty pharmacy partners play an important role in protecting profit margins on Valeant products.

American Express proved to be a bonanza for its shareholders because its valuable brand survived a crisis at an obscure subsidiary operating in a different line of business. Valeant’s Philidor scandal, by contrast, raises real questions about the company’s growth prospects and the long-term viability of its aggressive business model. For Valeant investors, this is an altogether different proposition, and one with a vastly different risk profile, than the one Mr. Buffett faced with American Express.

It can be dangerous to compare current investment opportunities to home runs from the annals of business history. A possible warning sign may be seen in a quiet insurrection at the Sequoia Fund, a Valeant shareholder that is one of the country’s most respected mutual funds.

When Mr. Buffett shut down his investment partnership in 1969, he recommended that his partners invest with his longtime friend William J. Ruane, who co-founded Sequoia the following year. The fund has since compiled a long history of market-beating returns. A big part of Sequoia’s success was a huge position in Mr. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which accounted for 35 percent of the portfolio by the end of 2004, shortly before Mr. Ruane’s death.

His successors drastically reduced the fund’s dependence on Berkshire Hathaway. Sequoia used the proceeds to buy stock in Valeant, which many shareholders, including Mr. Ackman, have compared to a young Berkshire Hathaway. At the end of June, Sequoia held a stunning 29 percent of its portfolio in Valeant stock.

Since then, two directors have left the Sequoia Fund board, reportedly because of concerns over the size of the Valeant position. It is exceedingly rare for directors to quit a mutual fund board because of disagreements over portfolio management.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals may prove to be another in a line of gut-wrenching winners for Mr. Ackman. But when investors look at Valeant and see American Express in 1964 or Berkshire Hathaway in 1970, rather than an envelope-pushing pharmaceuticals vehicle run by a former McKinsey consultant wielding low-cost leverage and a scalpel, there’s more than just fear in the air.

1256,"Issues have already surfaced in Ecuador.

A few miles from the site of the hydroelectric plant, the Coca River vaults down a 480-foot waterfall and cascades through steep canyons toward the Amazon. It is the tallest waterfall in Ecuador and popular with tourists.

When the dam is complete and the water is diverted to the plant, the San Rafael falls will slow to a trickle for part of the year. With climate change already shrinking the Andean glacier that feeds the river, experts debate whether the site will have enough water to generate even half the electricity predicted.

Ecuadoreans on the Chinese-run project have repeatedly protested about wages, health care, food and general working conditions. “The Chinese are arrogant,” said Oscar Cedeno, a 20-year-old construction worker. “They think they are superior to us.”

Last December, an underground river burst into a tunnel at the site. The high-pressure water flooded the powerhouse, killing 14 workers. It was one of a series of serious accidents at Chinese projects in Ecuador, several of them fatal.

The Rise of China

When the research arm of China’s cabinet scheduled an economic development conference this spring, the global financial and corporate elite came to Beijing. The heads of major banks and pharmaceutical, auto and oil companies mingled with top Chinese officials.

Some had large investments in the country and wanted to protect their access to the domestic market. Others came to court business, as Beijing channeled more of its money overseas.

At the event, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, commended China’s efforts to engage globally through investment and trade, as well as to enact economic reforms. It “is good for China and good for the world — their fates are intertwined,” she said in her keynote address.

China’s pull is strong.

It is the world’s largest buyer of oil, which gives China substantial sway over petropolitics. It is also increasingly the trading partner of choice for many countries, taking the mantle from Western nations. China’s foreign direct investment — the money it spends overseas annually on land, factories and other business operations — is second only to the United States’, having passed Japan last year.

Chinese companies are at the center of a worldwide construction boom, mostly financed by Chinese banks. They are building power plants in Serbia, glass and cement factories in Ethiopia, low-income housing in Venezuela and natural gas pipelines in Uzbekistan.

The evolution has been swift. When China started to open its economy in the late 1970s, Beijing had to court companies and investors.

One of the first multinationals to enter was the American Motors Corporation, which built a factory in Beijing. The project was initially aimed at producing Jeeps for export to Australia, rather than building cars for Chinese consumers.

“We didn’t devote a lot of our boardroom discussions to it,” said Gerald Meyers, then the chief executive of the carmaker. “We were really trying to scrape out a living in our domestic market.”

Today, China produces two million cars a month, far more than any other country. It mirrors the broader transformation of the economy from an insular agrarian society to the world’s largest manufacturer.

While the change has showered wealth on China, it has also brought new demands, like a voracious thirst for energy to power its economy. The confluence of trends has compelled China to look beyond its borders to invest those riches and to satisfy its needs.

Oil has been on the leading edge of this investment push. Energy projects and stakes have accounted for two-fifths of China’s $630 billion of overseas investments in the last decade, according to Derek Scissors, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.

China is playing both defense and offense. With an increased dependence on foreign oil, China’s leadership has followed the United States and other large economies by seeking to own more overseas oil fields — or at least the crude they produce — to ensure a stable supply. In recent years, state-controlled Chinese oil companies have acquired big stakes in oil operations in Cameroon, Canada, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iraq, Nigeria, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sudan, Uganda, the United States and Venezuela.

“When utilizing foreign resources and markets, we need to consider it from the height of national strategy,” Prime Minister Li said in 2009, when he was a vice premier. “If the resources mainly come from one country or from one place with frequent turmoil, national economic safety will be under shadow when an emergency happens.”

Road to Dependence

For President Correa of Ecuador, China represents a break with his country’s past — and his own.

His father was imprisoned in the United States for cocaine smuggling and later committed suicide. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Mr. Correa focused his doctoral thesis on the shortcomings of economic policies backed by Washington and Western banks.

As a politician, he embraced Venezuela’s socialist revolution. During his 2006 campaign, Mr. Correa joked that the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez’s comparison of President George W. Bush with Satan was disrespectful to the devil.

In an early move as president, Mr. Correa expelled the Americans from a military base in Manta, an important launching pad for the Pentagon’s war on drugs. “We can negotiate with the United States over a base in Manta if they let us put a military base in Miami,” President Correa said at the time.

Next, he severed financial ties. In late 2008, Mr. Correa called much of his country’s debt, largely owned by Western investors, “immoral and illegitimate” and stopped paying, setting off a default.

At that point, Ecuador was in a bind. The global financial crisis was taking hold and oil prices collapsed. Ecuador and Petroecuador, its state-owned oil company, started running low on money.

Shut out from borrowing in traditional markets, Ecuador turned to China to fill the void. PetroChina, the government-backed oil company, lent Petroecuador $1 billion in August 2009 for two years at 7.25 percent interest. Within a year, more Chinese money began to flow for hydroelectric and other infrastructure projects.

Spreading Its Wealth China has lent nearly $11 billion to Ecuador, much of which has gone for hydroelectric, bridge, road and other infrastructure projects.

“What Ecuador wants are sources of capital with fewer political strings attached, and that goes back to the personal history of Rafael Correa, who holds the United States directly or indirectly responsible for his father’s death and suffering,” said R. Evan Ellis, professor of Latin American studies at the United States Army War College Strategic Studies Institute. “But there is also a desire to get away from the dependence on the fiscal and political conditions of the I.M.F., World Bank and the West.”

The Ecuadorean foreign minister calls the shift to China a “diversification of its foreign relations,” rather than a substitute for the United States or Europe. “We have decided that the most convenient and healthy thing for us,” said the foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, is “to have friendly, mutually beneficial relations of respect with all countries.”

The Chinese money, though, comes with its own conditions. Along with steep interest payments, Ecuador is largely required to use Chinese companies and technologies on the projects.

International rules limit how the United States and other industrialized countries can tie their loans to such agreements. But China, which is still considered a developing country despite being the world’s largest manufacturer, doesn’t have to follow those standards.

It is one reason that China’s effort to build an international development fund, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, has faced criticism in the United States. Washington is worried that China will create its own rules, with lower expectations for transparency, governance and the environment.

While China has sought to quell those fears over the infrastructure fund, its portfolio of projects around the world imposes tough terms and sometimes lax standards. Since 2005, the country has landed $471 billion in construction contracts, many tied to broader lending agreements.

In Ecuador, a consortium of Chinese companies is overseeing a flood control and irrigation project in the southern Ecuador province of Cañar. A Chinese engineering company built a $100 million, four-lane bridge to span the Babahoyo River near the coast.

Such deals typically favor the Chinese.

PetroChina and Sinopec, another state-controlled Chinese company, together pump about 25 percent of the 560,000 barrels a day produced in Ecuador. Along with taking the bulk of oil exports, the Chinese companies also collect $25 to $50 in fees from Ecuador for each barrel they pump.

China’s terms are putting countries in precarious positions.

In Ecuador, oil represents roughly 40 percent of the government’s revenue, according to the United States Energy Department. And those earnings are suddenly plunging along with the price of oil. With crude at around $50 a barrel, Ecuador doesn’t have much left to repay its loans.

“Of course we have concerns over their ability to repay the debts — China isn’t silly,” said Lin Boqiang, the director of the Energy Economics Research Center at Xiamen University in China’s Fujian province and a government policy planner. “But the gist is resources will ultimately become valuable assets.”

If Ecuador or other countries can’t cover their debts, their obligations to China may rise. A senior Chinese banker, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity for diplomatic reasons, said Beijing would most likely restructure some loans in places like Ecuador.

To do so, Chinese authorities want to extend the length of the loans instead of writing off part of the principal. That means countries will have to hand over their natural resources for additional years, limiting their governments’ abilities to borrow money and pursue other development opportunities.

China has significant leverage to make sure borrowers pay. As the dominant manufacturer for a long list of goods, Beijing can credibly threaten to cut off shipments to countries that do not repay their loans, the senior Chinese banker said.

With its economy stumbling, Ecuador asked China at the start of the year for an additional $7.5 billion in financing to fill the growing government budget deficit and buy Chinese goods. Since then, the situation has only deteriorated. In recent weeks, thousands of protesters have poured into the streets of Quito and Guayaquil to challenge various government policies and proposals, some of which Mr. Correa has recently withdrawn.

“China is becoming the new company store for developing oil-, gas- and mineral-producing countries,” said David Goldwyn, who was the State Department’s special envoy for international energy affairs during President Obama’s first term. “They are entitled to secure reliable sources of oil, but what we need to worry about is the way they are encouraging oil-producing countries to mortgage their long-term future through oil-backed loans.”

Plagued by Problems

A pall of acrimony surrounds the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric plant, Ecuador’s largest construction project.

Few of the Chinese workers speak Spanish, and they live separately from their Ecuadorean counterparts. When the workers leave their camp in the village of San Luis at noon for lunch, they walk down the main street in separate groups. At night, they also walk in separate groups up the hill to the local brothel. (Prostitution is legal in Ecuador.) The workers sit at separate tables drinking bottles of the Ecuadorean beer, Pilsener.

When the Chinese and Ecuadorean workers return to camp, typically drunk, there have been shoving matches. Once a Chinese manager threw a tray at an Ecuadorean worker at mealtime.","China’s Global Ambitions, Cash and Strings Attached",2015-07-26,"The country has invested billions in Ecuador and elsewhere, using its economic clout to win diplomatic allies and secure natural resources around the world.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/business/international/chinas-global-ambitions-with-loans-and-strings-attached.html

HOUSTON — The opening of an investigation of Exxon Mobil by the New York attorney general’s office into the company’s record on climate change may well spur legal inquiries into other oil companies, according to legal and climate experts, although successful prosecutions are far from assured.

Many oil companies have funded lobbying efforts and research on climate change, so prosecutors would most likely be able to search through vast amounts of material. The industry has also resisted pressure for years from environmental groups to warn investors of the risks that stricter limits on carbon emissions could have on their businesses, although that appears to be changing.

“Exxon Mobil is not alone,” said Stephen Zamora, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center. “This is not likely to be an isolated matter.”

Energy experts said prosecutors may decide to investigate companies that chose to fund or join organizations that questioned climate science or policies designed to address the problem, such as the Global Climate Coalition and the American Legislative Exchange Council, to see if discrepancies exist between the companies’ public and private statements.

British Petroleum (now BP), Shell Oil, Texaco (now part of Chevron) and Exxon, along with several manufacturing companies, were all members of the coalition, a group of companies and trade associations that started an advertising campaign in the 1990s opposing Washington’s involvement in strong international efforts like the Kyoto Protocol initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Energy experts said internal documents from member companies about climate change could contradict what the companies said as part of the coalition, which disbanded in 2002.

“There was a concerted effort by multiple American oil companies to obscure the emerging climate science consensus throughout the 1990s,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton on climate issues. “This group may be vulnerable to legal challenge.”

British Petroleum and Shell Oil left the coalition early on, setting a pattern in which European oil companies took a very different course on climate and other environmental issues than most of their American competitors.

Shell announced this summer that it would not renew its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a free-enterprise group that has opposed government mandates, subsidies and other efforts to force or encourage companies to develop and use more renewable energy sources.

Occidental Petroleum and several other companies have also left ALEC, but Chevron and Exxon Mobil still support the group.

Big American and European oil companies can point to efforts they have made to support renewable energy, perhaps clouding attempts by prosecutors to paint them as one-sided on the issue of climate change.

Chevron, for example, has been a pioneer in geothermal energy for decades. Exxon Mobil has a project underway to convert algae into a biofuel that can run vehicles and soak up carbon. BP is active in wind power. Several companies in the United States have begun working with the Environmental Defense Fund to limit emissions of methane.

“The oil and gas industry has probably been the biggest funder of research into decarbonization, maybe more even than the federal government,” said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas.

But foreign oil and gas companies, including most recently Total of France and BHP Billiton of Australia, have been far more outspoken about the dangers of climate change than American ones.

Last month, 10 of the world’s biggest oil companies, including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Saudi Aramco, Repsol of Spain, Eni of Italy and Total, made a public declaration acknowledging that their industry must help address global climate change.

None of the big American companies joined the group, largely because they oppose carbon taxes and trading of carbon-emission permits — remedies that would raise the price of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas.

Last September, five major European, Asian and Latin American oil and gas companies signed on to a voluntary United Nations-backed program to monitor and disclose methane emissions, as well as invest in technologies to control greenhouse gases from their operations.

The only American company to join was Southwestern Energy, a midsize Houston-based company that mostly invests in natural gas.

“There are times to go off the reservation, and this may be one of them,” said Steven L. Mueller, chief executive of Southwestern Energy, just after his company joined the effort.

Energy experts say it will be harder to make cases against the oil companies than it was against tobacco companies that deliberately hid research from their customers, since many oil company scientists, including those of Exxon Mobil, have presented papers on climate change publicly at conferences and contributed to the research of international groups concerned with the issue.

“Unless they directly lied in Congress, the legal case against them is kind of thin,” said Hal Harvey, chief of Energy Innovation, an energy consultancy. But he added, the record shows that the companies “have walked away from being a credible spokesman on science.”",More Oil Companies Could Join Exxon Mobil as Focus of Climate Investigations,2015-11-07,The start of an inquiry by the New York attorney general’s office into Exxon Mobil’s record on climate change could lead to additional legal actions involving other major energy companies.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/science/more-oil-companies-could-join-exxon-mobil-as-focus-of-climate-investigations.html

1285,"“The economy continues to deteriorate,” said Yiannis Deligiannis, the founder of Tradenow. “The capital controls were the last bullet to the head. People have to find other ways to make things work. We are offering them one alternative.”

Much of it is being done virtually through online networks that match offers and needs, a digital twist on a centuries-old tradition.

Photo

After capital controls were imposed in June, about 6,000 users signed up for Tradenow, on top of 25,000 registered members. Even small businesses that had previously shunned barter networks as unworkable have come aboard.

The system equates one tradepoint to one euro, and lets users barter directly or rack up the digital currency to get goods and services from others in the community. To attract business, users can also deal in a mix of euros and points.

The modern online systems make bartering more efficient. The activity can also have a multiplier effect in the economy, generating new work and business.

At Mr. Roussos’s butcher shop, the first 20 chickens and 20 packages of ground beef he posted online for seven tradepoints each sold out quickly, allowing him to rack up points in his account. He doubled his offers, and new customers lined up.

“It went viral,” he said. “People want to barter because they have little money to buy.”

Some deal offers were not up to snuff. “One person wanted me to trade a Madonna CD for a chicken,” he said. “But I said no. The Madonna CD was definitely not worth a chicken.”

Mr. Roussos approached the tire vendor, whom he had met on the platform, and worked out the deal to renovate his van. He paid with a month’s supply of meat and tradepoints, which the vendor used to get an iPad.

Some advocates are pushing to make the so-called alternative economy more widespread, not only to combat the liquidity squeeze, but also to have some kind of system should Greece ever come crashing out of the euro. While the new government has pledged to keep Greece inside the single currency, analysts said new instability could reappear if Greece cannot carry out structural reforms demanded by its lenders.

When Greece verged on exiting the euro this summer, the government explored nationwide backups including I.O.U.s, a possible parallel currency or a return to the drachma. But barter advocates say communities would be able to cope more quickly if a barter system were in place.

“Greeks are aware there are devastating consequences of being in a single currency, like capital controls,” said Helen Panagiotopoulos, a researcher at the City University of New York who studies the Greek barter system. “There’s a pressing sense that we need to be working together to form something that connects us all, because we don’t know what may happen in the future.”

Achieving that may be a herculean task. Hundreds of barter communities emerged in Greece when the crisis broke out in 2010. Among them was Volos, a port city north of Athens where residents operate an alternative euro-equivalent currency called the TEM. Elsewhere, time banks sprang up, so doctors or babysitters could swap services. A “no-middleman” movement between producers and consumers cut out profiteers.

But many of those systems were plagued by inefficiencies. Time banks discovered that one unit of a doctor’s time was more valuable than a unit of a babysitter’s, complicating trades. In Volos, and in online barter clubs, problems arose because no rules ensured that counterparties to transactions would keep their end of a deal.

Similar troubles arose in Argentina, where a huge social money movement evolved in 2001 after the peso crisis. Scams and inefficiencies eventually plagued the system, causing it to splinter.

Greek barter advocates say they are learning from those mistakes. As they seek to revive barter platforms, their focus is on better rules and oversight.

Dimitris Mouroulis, a self-employed web designer, is among those leading the charge. On a recent afternoon, he scanned a bank of computer screens in the garage of his family’s home in Athens, which he converted into a sleek white work space partly with services from Free Economy, an online barter club that he founded in 2011.

To avoid “phantom traders,” people who sign onto barter platforms and get goods or services without returning them in kind, Mr. Mouroulis requires users to provide identification and financial guarantees. A social activist who says he is driven by an ethos of solidarity for Greece, he has been meeting with other barter club founders to strategize over whether his model can help.

With just 85 members, Free Economy is hardly a parallel economic universe. But for some, the system has become a lifeline.

Jorgos Kazianis, 59, an experienced electrician who worked on projects like the Athens metro, had not found steady work since 2010 until he heard about Mr. Mouroulis’s network. He wired Mr. Mouroulis’s garage in exchange for alternate currency, which he used to procure olive oil, food and motorcycle parts. Other people began contacting him through the barter platform and now, one out of every five projects is a barter deal.

“It makes a difference,” Mr. Kazianis said. “I have virtual money in my barter account, and the best part is, there are no capital controls.” He does not trust the banks, and has €400, about $445, in his regular bank account, but €600 worth of virtual currency in his Free Economy account.

While some view bartering as a step backward, Mr. Kazianis said he saw it as a natural progression to relieve some of the misery that money — and the country’s membership in the euro currency — has brought to Greek society.

“Since ancient times, when there was no money, transactions happened through bartering,” he said. “I have no faith in money the way it has evolved today. This crisis is the byproduct of what money has become, where there’s a lot of it in the hands of the few, and a deficit of it for most other people.”",Trading Meat for Tires as Bartering Economy Grows in Greece,2015-09-23,"As Greece grapples with a continued downturn, bartering is gaining traction at the margins of the economy, a worrisome sign for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras who was re-elected on Sunday.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/business/international/trading-meat-for-tires-as-bartering-economy-grows-in-greece.html

MOSCOW — The Russian energy giant Gazprom announced on Wednesday that it had halted deliveries of natural gas to Ukraine because of a pricing dispute.

Gazprom has not received advance payment for deliveries of natural gas in July, Alexey B. Miller, the chief executive of Gazprom, said in a statement on Wednesday, and had cut the flow of natural gas to Ukraine immediately.

“Gazprom will not deliver gas to Ukraine at any price without prepayment,” Mr. Miller said.

One day earlier, Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state energy company, said it would cease buying Russian gas because of disputes over prices and the breakdown of talks mediated by the European Union to negotiate a new contract.

Russia briefly cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine in June 2014 amid a growing conflict between the Ukrainian Army and pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine after the ouster of the president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Disputes over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine had also led to shut-offs in 2006 and 2008.

Gazprom, which is controlled by the Russian government, raised prices on gas after Mr. Yanukovych’s ouster. On Monday, the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, announced a third-quarter gas price of $247.18 per thousand cubic meters for Ukraine, close to a $40 discount on Russia’s benchmark price. Previously, Russia had given the Ukrainians a $100 discount on the gas price, partly in exchange for leasing rights to the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. That discount was canceled after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014.

Analysts say that Ukraine has sufficient stores of gas to make it through the summer, when consumption is low. Ukraine has claimed that it can supplement its supplies by purchasing Russian gas exported to other countries, like Slovakia.

Ildar Davletshin, an oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital, noted that the instability in Ukraine would most likely delay a long-term agreement over gas supplies from Russia.

“Possibly Russia does not want to increase its exposure to Ukraine, the risk of growing loans,” Mr. Davletshin said. “Also, they can use this as a way to put some pressure on the Ukrainian government.”

Ukraine is a transit corridor for Russian gas exports to the European Union, but Mr. Davletshin said the supply cut had “no critical implications short term in terms of consumption or gas flow to Europe.” He added that Ukraine would likely have to strike a deal in the fall in order to replenish stores of natural gas before colder temperatures set in.",Gazprom Halts Natural Gas Deliveries to Ukraine,2015-07-02,"The Russian energy giant and Ukraine are locked in a pricing dispute, and negotiations over a new contract have broken down.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/business/international/gazprom-ukraine-natural-gas-deliveries-russia.html

LAO CAI, Vietnam — National flags rustled in the breeze on both banks of the Red River, but nothing else was moving at this normally bustling border crossing.

On the Chinese side, a concrete landing area was empty.

On the Vietnamese side, more than a dozen maroon-hulled motorboats were docked, upriver from the border city of Lao Cai. Just as many container trucks were parked bumper-to-bumper along a narrow road leading to the crossing, baking in the midday sun.

Three Vietnamese truckers, eating fried pork and drinking vodka at a nearby restaurant, said trade had stalled at this semiofficial crossing for much of the spring, under orders from the border authorities.

One trucker said that seven of the trucks had not moved for two months. Another complained that it was costing him nearly $7 an hour to keep his cargo — chicken wings, he said — refrigerated.

“I’m angry about having to wait, but I have no choice,” said a third trucker, who wore jeans and a denim shirt and gave only his first name, Cuong.

Red River 200 Miles CHINA Lao Cai Hanoi LAOS Gulf of Tonkin Mekong River South China Sea THAILAND VIETNAM CAMBODIA Ho Chi Minh City

The relationship between Vietnam and China, always hot and cold, hit a low point last year after China moored an oil exploration rig in waters off Vietnam’s central coast, setting off anti-Chinese protests in Vietnamese cities and riots in some industrial parks. The tension has lingered as Beijing has built islands in parts of the South China Sea that are claimed by Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations.

Political ups and downs typically do not have major effects on overall trade and investment ties between Vietnam and China, its largest trading partner. But they have profound effects on the small-scale traders who live near Vietnam’s 800-mile border with China.

In May, for example, a 152-mile highway from Hanoi was extended to the border in Lao Cai, the provincial capital, and officials from both countries met to discuss plans for creating an economic cooperation zone here, raising hopes among local businesspeople for increased trade.

But just a few days later, Chinese and Vietnamese defense ministers met to discuss border management, and local traders said the result was a clampdown on cross-border trade, particularly at the semiofficial Red River crossings where customs enforcement normally hovers between lax and nonexistent. They said a similar clampdown had persisted for months after last year’s oil rig episode.

“The relationship between Vietnam and China is always going up and down, and it’s the same with business,” Do Thi Lien, 57, said at her truckers’ canteen near an official crossing in Lao Cai. “But Chinese people are just like us: They don’t want any trouble. It’s our governments that make trouble.”

In one apparent sign of Vietnamese-Chinese tensions, the general secretary of Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, who is widely viewed as more friendly toward China than toward the United States, may visit Washington as early as this summer, the first such visit by any Vietnamese party secretary.

The party’s senior leadership has long been divided over how close Vietnam should be to China or the United States.

But a Vietnamese academic in Hanoi with close ties to the government, who requested anonymity to discuss a politically sensitive matter, said Mr. Trong’s planned trip reflected a growing consensus inside the party that a stronger relationship with the United States was in Vietnam’s national interest.

Independent Hanoi intellectuals, too, are urging the government to escape China’s economic orbit and deepen trade ties with the United States and the European Union.

But the Vietnamese who live on the border tend to see things differently.

“Traders on the borders don’t care about the national interest,” said Alexander Vuving, a Vietnam expert at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. “They may have that sense of ‘We are proud of being independent,’ but their first interest is their business.”

That goes for Nguyen Duy Manh, a trader who says he used to smuggle beef, seafood and other contraband across the river into China, and fruit, vegetables and cigarettes back into Vietnam.

“If we sell everything we have to China, then Vietnam won’t develop, and that’s very bad,” Mr. Manh, 29, said between drags of a cigarette on the patio of his home. “But a lot of workers aren’t thinking about politics. They just think about how much money they can earn.”

The mutual dependence and misgivings go back centuries. China ruled northern Vietnam for more than a millennium, and the China-Vietnam border was abruptly closed after a short border war in 1979.

After the border reopened in 1991, trade increased economic growth on both sides, and new relationships between the Vietnamese and Chinese sprouted up based on mutual economic interests, Yuk Wah Chan, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong, said in an email. But current tensions in the South China Sea have repercussions on borderland economies, she added, often in the form of tightening border procedures and heavier scrutiny of illicit trade.

As dawn broke over the skinny buildings and corrugated red roofs of Lao Cai’s downtown on a recent weekday, Vietnamese traders were walking back and forth along a bridge that is an official pedestrian crossing to China. Many set off carrying fresh fruit on bicycle-mounted wooden pallets, and returned with Chinese produce or bundles of consumer goods like clothing or umbrellas.

Ha Thi Huong, a trader working near the bridge, was racing to finish selling a shipment of mangoes that had been trucked in from southern Vietnam. She had sold five 110-pound crates around 3 a.m. to traders who smuggled the fruit into China under cover of darkness, she said. But now it was almost 7 a.m., and the mangoes in her last two crates were going soft in the heat.

Ms. Huong, 25, said that she occasionally sold fruit to local traders who resold it in Lao Cai, but that her primary business was across the Red River.

“If people here couldn’t trade with China for a few days, we’d all be out of work,” she said.","When Vietnam and China Bicker, Traders on the Border Feel the Bluster",2015-06-26,Political ups and downs between Hanoi and Beijing have profound effects on the small-scale traders who live near the shared 800-mile boundary.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/world/asia/when-vietnam-and-china-bicker-traders-on-the-border-feel-the-bluster.html

1292,"A sharp drop in the price of oil on Monday rattled investors and helped push stocks lower across several industries.

Investors sold from the start of trading following a decision by OPEC last week not to cut production. Benchmark U.S. crude dropped nearly 6 percent, deepening its year-and-a-half plunge, and closed at its lowest level in nearly seven years. The losses were broad, with seven of the 10 industry sectors in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closing lower.

As they have all year, oil drillers bore the brunt of the selling. Chevron and Exxon Mobil, both members of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, each fell nearly 3 percent.

“There was a big hope that OPEC would announce a production cut, but it just didn’t happen,” said Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho Securities chief economist. He added: “The whole world is facing excess supply as the global economy slows.”

In theory, lower oil prices should help many stocks because consumers typically spend the money they save at the pump or on heating bills in other ways, but so far that hasn’t happened.

“Retailers have been waiting for the pump-price dividend to filter into their stores, but for the most part we’re not seeing it,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.

The shift in the U.S. to producing more oil has made the stock market more vulnerable to price swings in the commodity.

In each of the past three quarters, as oil prices have tanked, earnings per share for energy companies in the S.&P. 500 have dropped more than 50 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ, a financial data provider. After Monday’s drop, their stocks are down 22 percent since the start of the year.

Among other stocks making big moves, Chipotle Mexican Grill dropped $9.45, or 1.7 percent, to $551.75. The restaurant chain warned late Friday that an outbreak of E. coli linked to its restaurants sent sales plummeting by as much as 22 percent in recent weeks.

1295,"Ulises Flores González, 32, said workers from Mr. Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, turned up at his house shortly after the state campaign kicked off last month.

“The PRI offered me a television screen to give my vote,” said Mr. Flores, who works in his family’s small produce store. “I rejected it. I wouldn’t want to sell my vote.”

María Carvajal, 41, who cleans houses in the state capital, Toluca, said that the PRI, which governed Mexico for seven decades before being dumped by voters in 2000 and returning to power under Mr. Peña Nieto in 2012, often hands out money or food packages at election time. The State of Mexico is Mr. Peña Nieto’s home state and a PRI bastion.

“I don’t think it is fair to just try to buy people off like that,” she said, describing how she received her television coupon. “It is the same with the TVs, and it has always been this way.”

There are big issues at stake in this election, which will choose all 500 members of Mexico’s lower house of Congress and almost a third of the country’s governors, as well as mayors and legislatures in more than half of the states.

Mr. Peña Nieto needs a working majority in Congress to support a budget overhaul in response to falling oil revenues and to restart his stalled security proposals. A majority would also give his party control over writing the fine print of a new anticorruption system it supported reluctantly.

Polls show that more than half of Mexicans disapprove of the president’s job performance. His standing has been battered by a scandal over his wife’s purchase of a mansion from a government contractor and his government’s handling of an investigation into the disappearance of 43 students.

Amid continued drug violence and meager economic growth, about two-thirds of Mexicans believe that the country is on the wrong track, according to Francisco Abundis, director of the polling firm Parametría.

Five candidates have been killed, including one shot dead on Tuesday. Teachers opposed to a broad education overhaul promise to boycott the election in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca. Since Monday, demonstrators have stormed the National Electoral Institute’s offices in both states, destroying equipment and burning ballots.

“We have to be prepared for the worst possible scenario,” said Lorenzo Córdova, the president of the National Electoral Institute.

But the parties and their campaigns mostly gloss over the country’s pressing issues by competing to hand out gifts while making vague promises of jobs, security, education and social programs.

“It’s a structural problem,” Mr. Córdova said. “As long as we have poverty, there is always the tendency to use public resources to profit from poverty for political gain.”

The campaign gifts are illegal in most cases, but subjected to fines or other sanctions only after complaints are lodged with the Electoral Institute. Because all the parties break the law, such complaints are rare.

Mexico’s elections are publicly financed, and parties receive free television and radio spots. Private donations are allowed, but they are capped, and there are limits on campaign spending.

Even so, private donations flow unchecked and spending often greatly exceeds the limits, with a variety of means used to avoid detection, said Luis Carlos Ugalde, a former president of the Electoral Institute. That is unlikely to be halted this year by new, tougher auditing rules, Mr. Ugalde said.

“Having money doesn’t guarantee that you win,” he said. “But not having money guarantees that you won’t win.”

Exhibit A during this campaign has been the misnamed Green Party, which is perhaps best known for its support of the death penalty. The party has broken the election laws so persistently that the fines imposed by the Electoral Institute have all but stripped it of its public funding.

Such blatant inducements — many voters received free movie tickets on behalf of the Green Party in the mail, for example — are more than a campaign curiosity. The Greens are the PRI’s reliable allies. Because polls put the PRI’s support at about 32 percent, a strong showing by the Greens is essential to ensuring a majority for Mr. Peña Nieto.

The question is how much impact the handouts will have, especially when the gift is as desirable as a television.

The television plan may be necessary for the country as a whole, Mr. Abundis said, but distributing screens during an election campaign “is like oiling the machinery.”

Still, it is not clear whether inducements will tip the scales in the election. “However great the goody is, it won’t convince you to change your vote,” he said.

Mexico’s communications ministry decided two years ago to jettison an earlier plan to give low-income families converter boxes that allow analog televisions to receive digital signals. Many countries, including the United States, enacted some version of subsidies for the boxes during their transitions to digital television.

Only Mexico, according to a detailed study of 34 countries by Gustavo Rivera Loret de Mola, a consultant on electoral issues, chose to give away televisions, a plan he said costs hundreds of millions of dollars more than providing converter boxes. He also found that some of the televisions have ended up in pawn shops.

The government’s argument is that the digital televisions being given away have the added benefit of reducing electricity consumption by 60 percent. Beyond that, it says, buying so many screens supports manufacturing in Mexico, the world’s second-largest exporter of digital televisions.

Working through the social development ministry, the government has handed out three million televisions to families on government assistance since the plan began last May. Some seven million screens must be distributed by the end of the year to meet a deadline set by Congress.

Yet criticism has been fierce.

“Without a doubt, the televisions are an exercise in political patronage,” said Alfonso Zarate, a political analyst and columnist.

Despite complaints lodged by opposition parties, a commission of the National Electoral Institute voted against suspending the handout during the campaigns.

Here in Ecatepec, whose population of 1.66 million makes it the country’s largest municipality after Mexico City — and a prize for any party — a brisk mayoral campaign has just wrapped up alongside the television handout.

The government expects to distribute about 178,000 televisions to households in Ecatepec by the end of this month.

But as Octavio Martínez, the mayoral candidate for the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, knocked on the metal gates of concrete-block houses to seek votes and hand out his cellphone number, he found that voters were often thinking about other matters.

“What do we want? Security,” snapped María del Carmen Alvaréz Delgado, 55, an English teacher, saying that all the parties give something away during their campaigns and promise more handouts if they win.

1296,"Further complicating that deal is Russia’s inability to pay for the pipelines, and the question of whether China needs the Russian gas badly enough to finance their construction, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “China will have to pay for the construction, one way or another, given Russia’s financial crunch,” he said.

A Chinese expert on Russia, who is usually sanguine about the relationship with Moscow, said that the deal had also run into pricing problems. “The negotiations face many difficulties due to the plunge in the price of gas,” said Zhao Huasheng, director of the Center for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “We have to recalculate all the costs and try to push for a price cut.”

In Moscow, similarly, optimism about China substantially helping Russia out of its economic problems has faded.

“The big hope that China is going to provide a lifeline to sustain Russia through the sanctions and the falling oil price is not working,” said Alexander Gabuev, an analyst of Russian-Chinese relations at the Carnegie Moscow Center.

“It is a symbolic relationship — with a small, volatile economic base,” he said. The Kremlin elite was “disappointed that nothing has materialized as quickly as the Russians hoped.”

Russian demand for Chinese manufactured goods is down 40 percent, and for clothing 50 percent, from this time last year, Mr. Gabuev said. The volatile ruble has made Chinese investors wary, and attempts to get the countries’ banking sectors to work together have not borne much fruit, he added.

Because the goal of $100 billion in trade with China looks impossible to reach in 2015, the $200 billion the countries had projected by 2020 might also prove overly optimistic, Russian officials say.

The big energy deals are not the only victim of the economic slowdowns.

A fast rail link that China had said it would build to Beijing from Moscow is in doubt because China, which is an expert at such construction, is demanding that Russia pay for it. The nearly 500-mile first leg, between Moscow and Kazan, was scheduled to open before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. But work has yet to start, and it is unlikely to, Ms. Hill said. “The Russians won’t have the money to pay for it, and the Chinese are not going to do it for free,” she said.

The friendship between Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi has been striking and captured the attention of both countries, because each man likes to project an image of power and even daring. At global gatherings, they almost strut on the stage together. At a meeting of Asian leaders on the Indonesian island of Bali in 2013, Mr. Xi presented Mr. Putin with a birthday cake. In Beijing in November, Mr. Putin demonstrated for Mr. Xi the finer points of a Russian cellphone.

Their apparent mutual admiration has been all the more noticeable because of the long and rocky relationship during the Cold War between Communist China and the Soviet Union, when the countries were ostensibly on the same side but nearly came to a nuclear showdown in 1969 over a border war. The tenure of Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the helm of the Soviet Union sent shudders through the Chinese Communist Party, and still does.

“There has never been a close relationship until recently,” Ms. Hill said. “The success of China has bred the interest of Russia.” Even though Chinese growth was slowing, China still seemed “brighter” to the Russians relative to the downswings in Europe and Ukraine and to their own economic problems, she said.

The sanctions on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine also pushed the two countries closer.

Both leaders boast that they have elevated the ties between their countries to a strategic relationship; Russia and China recently held joint naval exercises in the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan. And they have joined at the United Nations in opposing American initiatives in Libya and Syria, and have held similar views on Iran.

But there are limits to their strategic interests. China has been wary of Russia’s moves in Crimea and particularly in Ukraine, where Beijing has commercial and military investments. It also worries that Crimea’s secession from Ukraine might set a precedent for Chinese territories such as Tibet or Xinjiang or for the world to recognize Taiwan’s de facto independence.

In Central Asia, they are more competitors than cooperative friends, especially as China buys energy from countries that have been in Russia’s traditional sphere of influence, energy that China could, if it wanted, purchase from Russia.

The Obama administration has responded to the friendship with a certain nonchalance, arguing that Russia will inevitably be a liability to China, particularly in hard economic times.

In the words of Douglas H. Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “Washington seems to think Putin is more burden than boon to Beijing.”",Friendship Between Putin and Xi Becomes Strained as Economies Falter,2015-09-04,"Slowdowns in Russia and China have put energy deals between the countries in question, affecting the once-vaunted relationship between the two leaders.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/world/asia/friendship-between-putin-and-xi-becomes-strained-as-economies-falter.html

For years, New Jersey officials have been trying to make Exxon Mobil Corporation pay for their “staggering and unprecedented” pollution of the state’s northeastern wetlands. The price tag for damages and cleanup of more than 1,500 acres in the Linden and Bayonne areas was estimated at $8.9 billion. Gov. Chris Christie settled for a payout of $225 million from Exxon, a paltry sum that won the approval of a state judge earlier this week.

That ruling by Judge Michael Hogan of New Jersey’s Superior Court is a major setback for the environment and the taxpayers of New Jersey. As Margaret Brown, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said after the ruling, “This is a multi-billion gift to ExxonMobil from Governor Christie and his administration, at the expense of New Jersey residents.”

Exxon’s predecessors began dumping toxic substances into the marshlands in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Nearly a century later, the state courts held Exxon liable for damages, and the company has spent around $260 million so far to cap and control pollution at these sites.

These once-pristine areas turned dumping grounds were described as “sludge lagoons” in a state report a few years ago. State officials described the Bayonne site, for example, as soaked with decades’ worth of petroleum, 15 feet deep in some places. Once-thriving salt marshes were turned solid by the contaminants — all of which should be removed, not capped or covered.

If appeals fail, and they certainly might in New Jersey, there is another concern. What happens to the paltry cleanup fee once Exxon writes the check? Clearly this money should go directly to help protect, preserve or restore the environment that has been so destroyed over the years by the petroleum industry. After the lawyers’ fees, it won’t be that much — certainly not anything close to $8.9 billion. But the last thing New Jersey residents need is for Exxon’s payout to go into the general budget fund, that huge soup of money to be used or misused by Governor Christie and the state legislature.",Governor Christie’s Gift to Exxon Mobil,2015-08-28,The company will have to pay just $225 million for its pollution of New Jersey’s wetlands.,http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/governor-christies-gift-to-exxon-mobil/

1300,"South Sudanese officials would neither confirm nor deny the loan, reported to be $250 million to $500 million, but the economic crisis is evident everywhere.

The day after the anniversary, there will still be less than 50 miles of paved roads in a country of 11 million people. There will still be few paying jobs outside the military and the government. And there will still be little indication of how the world’s newest nation can put itself back together.

In recent months, the fighting has intensified and threatened the government’s main source of income: oil.

“South Sudan is the most oil-dependent country in the world,” according to the World Bank, “with oil accounting for almost the totality of exports.”

Rebel forces attacked the last working oil field in May, forcing workers to evacuate and nearly seizing control before being turned back. They began another offensive last week, but it is unclear how close they came to the oil field.

Even before the war, oil income was severely strained by South Sudan’s terms with Sudan, the nation it split from after decades of war.

The government pays a set fee to Sudan, regardless of the price of oil, and it is now making less than $10 a barrel, according to Western officials. Since the war began, production has fallen by one-third, according to the Oil Ministry.

The shortages of gasoline and diesel force gas stations to close without notice, and the currency has recently undergone wild fluctuations.

Shoppers at the Konyo Konyo market here in the heart of the capital, where tin stalls packed with goods brought from outside South Sudan line rutted dirt roads, do not need an economist to tell them that things are not right.

Even though the shelves are filled with staples like beans, wheat and flour, business is as bad as anyone can remember since the fighting started at the end of 2013.

Joyce Pony, whose family fled its village when fighting broke out, sells roasted nuts outside the stalls.

Even she has been forced to raise her prices. A cup of nuts used to cost 1 South Sudanese pound a few months ago. Now it is 5 pounds.

Asked why she thinks prices are rising, she said she was told it had something to do with the dollar.

“I have never seen a dollar,” she said. “But it rules my life.”

The rising anger is palpable.

The minister for national security, Obutu Mamur Mete, recently told lawmakers that criminals and gangs were taking advantage of the situation, citing a “high spike of robbery and looting people’s houses.”

In early June, he said, a soldier at one market “threatened to shoot out of frustration because the price of an item he was buying doubled from the previous” time he bought the same thing.

Still, the governing elite can seem divorced from the tragedy playing out in parts of the country, where hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to seek refuge in swamps or the bush inland.

Shiny new sport utility vehicles with government plates crisscross the capital, going from hotel to hotel, places that many members of the governing party and military now call home.

Sensing the tide of resentment, the Parliament recently debated whether to debate imposing a ban on government workers’ buying fancy new cars. The debate about the debate ended without the debate itself ever happening.

The only people who can reliably expect a paycheck, for the most part, are members of the security forces and workers in the government ministries.

Not that the ministries are functioning.

Even in the capital, which is secure, there is almost no reliable electricity, no running water system and no sanitation.

Last year, Mr. Kiir announced the opening of a health clinic and blood bank. With great fanfare, he offered it as an example of how he was working for the people.

But with no qualified workers, he had to bring in staff members from a nearby hospital. A few weeks after it was opened, the clinic was closed and the workers went back to the hospital. As this year’s independence anniversary drew near, it remained closed.

The schools are also being affected.

Teachers are paid 300 pounds a month, compared with 600 pounds for those in the security service. Many teachers have gone months without being paid at all, so many are now flocking to the army and the police.

Col. Philip Aguer, a spokesman for the South Sudan People’s Liberation Army, did not deny that the economic situation was “difficult,” but he said that the army would never collapse.

“As long as I get my salary, the government has money,” he said.

Nearly all the money it does have is going to sustain the war effort. Even one of the few power lines that worked in the country — supplying a hospital — was cut off when members of the army took all the diesel from the power station, according to people who saw them taking the supplies.

In a country with enormous agricultural potential, almost all food is now imported. And the cost is steadily rising. A single onion that cost 1 pound six months ago now costs 5 pounds. The price of a pineapple has tripled. The price of just about every other food item at the Konyo Konyo market has doubled or tripled.

Lee Nour, 21, like most of the people running stalls, is from somewhere else. He came from Somalia.

“It is hard for the people to pay,” he said. “But they pay. They have no choice.”

Abdulla Youssef, 24, drives one of the three-wheeled tuk-tuks that function as cabs in the city. A vehicle used to cost 18,000 pounds six months ago, he said. Now it costs 45,000 pounds.

“It is all too much,” he said.

The few jobs available are often short term.

Benjamin Akol, 31, is a Ugandan engineer employing 160 South Sudanese to fix the roads around where the anniversary celebration will take place.

“We are cleaning and making it look good, and they promise there will be work after,” he said.

Patrick Namakoola, 36, one of the workers, hopes that the promises are true. Still, he said, the people will find a way to make do.

“Money’s needs are never satisfied,” he said. “But whatever I have can sustain me. It must.”

He recalled the independence day celebration four years ago, when the streets were filled with people from every ethnic group, sect and clan.

After an indecisive day, stocks rallied in the last minutes of trading on Monday and managed to end with modest gains.

Last week, the market had its worst drop since mid-August, and for much of Monday, it looked as if the losses would continue. Near midday the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index hit a two-month low. But oil prices recovered from last week’s rout, and the broader market finished at its highest levels of the day.

The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 103.29 points, or 0.6 percent, to 17,358.50. The S.&P. 500 index gained 9.57 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,021.94. Nine of the 10 sectors on the S.&P. 500 finished higher, though most of the gains were small. The Nasdaq added 18.76 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,952.23.

Early in the day the price of oil fell below $35 a barrel for the first time since early 2009. But oil prices recovered and rose about 2 percent, breaking a streak of six straight losses.

United States crude gained 35 cents to $37.60 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, fell a penny to $37.92 a barrel in London.

The gain sent oil companies broadly higher. Exxon Mobil shares rose $1.69, or 2.3 percent, to $76.03, and Chevron shares added $2.89, or 3.3 percent, to $89.33.

But natural gas prices plunged to their lowest level since September 2001 as warm weather continued to erode demand for home heating. Natural gas fell 9.6 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $1.894 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The falling price hurt natural gas companies. Shares of Range Resources sank 89 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $21.86, and Southwestern Energy shares slumped 57 cents, or 9.7 percent, to $5.33.

Stephen Schork, an independent analyst and trader, said industrial demand for natural gas in the United States and from Canada had tumbled. That means the biggest remaining source of demand are consumers who use gas to heat their homes. But it has been a very warm winter so far.

“This weather’s going to persist through the rest of this month,” Mr. Schork said. But he said prices would recover if it gets colder in January.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline declined 2.6 cents, or 2 percent, to $1.256 a gallon, and heating oil lost 1.8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $1.128 a gallon.

Mr. Loeb, who owns a stake in Dow Chemical, questioned the timing of the deal and wants the chief of Dow, Andrew N. Liveris, removed. Dow’s board said it stood by the proposal.

On Friday, Dow and DuPont agreed to combine into a $130 billion company and then split up into three smaller businesses. Mr. Loeb has pushed Dow to split its specialty chemical and petrochemical businesses. Another activist investor, Nelson Peltz, has been pushing DuPont to break itself up.

Dow Chemical shares lost $2.08, or 3.9 percent, to $51.29, and DuPont shares slid $2.52, or 3.6 percent, to $67.92.

Mining companies and industrial materials makers declined on Monday, with Dow and DuPont leading the way. The copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan dropped as copper prices continued to slide. Freeport shares lost 44 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $6.46.

The consumer products maker Jarden agreed to be acquired by a competitor, Newell Rubbermaid. The cash and stock deal would create a conglomerate that owns brands like Paper Mate, Sharpie, Elmer’s, Rubbermaid and Calphalon.

The deal is worth at least $13.2 billion, or $60 a share. Jarden stock added $1.41, or 2.7 percent, to $54.09. Newell Rubbermaid shares fell $3.13, or 6.9 percent, to $42.15.

The Federal Reserve will start its last meeting of the year on Tuesday, and on Wednesday it is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.

Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist for Federated Investors, said the Fed was reacting to positive signs like increased hiring and economic growth. While inflation is lower than the Fed would like, Mr. Orlando said the Fed would not wait for inflation to rise further because it will take a long time before the economy feels the full effect of higher interest rates.

“The Fed can’t wait,” he said. “It’ll be 18 months before that change in policy hits the economy,” he said.

Mr. Orlando said he thought the rise in interest rates would set off a rally that would take stocks higher for the rest of the year, possibly back to the record levels they set in May. Stocks have wobbled in recent weeks. It has been more than a month since the S.&P. 500 rose for two consecutive days.

1304,"A deepening slump in prices for oil, metals and other commodities sent stock prices lower on Thursday.

Major market indexes opened lower and the selling accelerated as the day wore on. The drop in oil and metals prices hurt mining, metals and energy stocks.

Stocks began sliding since early this month and have returned some of the gains from a powerful rally in October.

The S.&P. 500 has fallen for six out of the last seven days, and Thursday’s decline was the largest over that time. While October was the best month for the market in four years, the S.&P. 500 is now down slightly this year. The Dow average is also lower in 2015.

Mike McGlone, head of U.S. research for ETF Securities, said investors were coming to grips with the fact that the Federal Reserve is about to start raising interest rates, ending an era of stimulus policies that have boosted stocks. At the same time, stocks could get hurt by warning signs about the U.S. economy, like weak jobs data or disappointing earnings.

“Now we have almost a lose-lose situation” for stocks, Mr. McGlone said.

Precious metals prices surged during the Great Recession, but in recent years many investors bought stocks instead, leading to a sustained slump in the prices of gold and silver.

Metals like copper and steel have been hurt by the sluggish global economy, and copper prices are down 23 percent this year. All three fell Thursday after the head of Europe’s central bank said new stimulus measures may be put in place next month. That would boost the dollar at the expense of the euro. The central bank of Japan is considering similar moves, which would make the dollar stronger compared to the yen.

Gold declined $3.90 to $1,081 an ounce and silver fell for the tenth consecutive day, losing 3.8 cents to $14.225 an ounce. It’s down 11 percent since late October. Copper fell 4.6 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.173 a pound. Copper prices have tumbled 23 percent this year.

Mining and metals companies slumped. Freeport-McMoRan dropped 54 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $8.77. Its stock has skidded 69 percent over the past year. Steel maker Nucor fell $1.11, or 2.7 percent, to $40.11. Nucor has lost a quarter of its value in the past year.

When the dollar appreciates it tends to send prices for metals, oil and other commodities, which are priced in dollars, lower. That’s because buyers using other currencies such as the yen and the euro often aren’t willing to pay higher prices in their own currency just because the dollar has appreciated.

“Since November hit, the U.S. dollar has gone straight up and these commodities are getting smoked,” said Ryan Detrick, a markets strategist at Kimble Charting Solutions.

The price of oil slid for the sixth time in seven days and hit its lowest price since late August after the U.S. government said crude stockpiles grew by 4.2 million barrels last week.

Its offer values Angie’s List at $512 million, or $8.75 a share. The gains suggest investors are hoping for an improved offer.

Angie’s List confirmed it received the offer and said it was unsolicited. Its shares have doubled in recent months, but are down sharply from their level of $28 in 2013.

1309,"WASHINGTON — Retail sales rose less than expected in October, hindered by a surprise decline in automobile purchases.

The October results suggest a developing slowdown in consumer spending that could temper expectations of a strong pickup in fourth-quarter economic growth.

Other data on Friday showed a second monthly decline in producer prices as the cost of services fell. Still, the soft inflation and signs of slowing consumer spending are unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates next month, economists said.

“The weak reports will provide some cause for caution at the Fed, and while they are unlikely to change the prevailing bias for a December ‘liftoff,’ they could add to the case for a shallower tightening path thereafter,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.

The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in September and August. Economists had forecast a 0.3 percent increase.

Sales at auto dealerships fell 0.5 percent last month after rising 1.4 percent in September. The decline was surprising because automakers reported strong sales for October. Economists said heavy discounting to attract buyers probably caused the discrepancy. A 0.9 percent drop in the value of sales at service stations, which reflected lower gasoline prices, also helped to restrain retail sales last month.

Retail Sales Total retail and food services sales, seasonally adjusted. AUG. Unch. SEPT. Unch. OCT. +0.1% $450 billion 400 350 300 ’14 ’15

Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain in September. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The lackluster report suggests that the savings from cheaper gasoline were used to pay rent, which increased substantially in the last year.

Barclays trimmed its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.4 percent annual rate. The weak October retail sales also could raise concerns about the holiday shopping season. But economists are optimistic of sturdy consumer spending for the rest of the year, as faster job growth and low inflation increase disposable income.

That view was supported by the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, which rose to 93.1 in early November from 90.0 in October.

The survey showed improvement in buying plans for large discretionary purchases, especially vehicles. Lower-income households also were upbeat about their prospects this month.

“The rise in confidence to the level last seen in July might ease a few concerns at the Fed about slowing growth in recent months,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The Labor Department’s Producer Price Index fell 0.4 percent last month after dropping 0.5 percent in September. In the 12 months through October, the index fell 1.6 percent. The decline was the largest since the revamped series started in 2009 and followed a 1.1 percent drop in September. Economic growth slowed to a 1.5 percent rate in the third quarter as businesses worked through an inventory glut and energy companies continued to cut spending in response to lower oil prices.

1313,"In a welcome development, businesses are asking world leaders to do more to address climate change. This week, the top executives of six large European oil and gas companies called for a tax on carbon emissions.

These companies — the BG Group, BP, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and Total — are not taking a bold environmental stand. They are being pragmatic. They want an efficient and predictable policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions because they realize something must be done. Numerous scientists, economists, environmentalists and political leaders have previously proposed similar ideas.

A carbon tax would raise the price of fossil fuels, with more taxes collected on fuels that generate more emissions, like coal. This tax would reduce demand for high-carbon emission fuels and increase demand for lower-emisson fuels like natural gas. Renewable sources like solar, wind, nuclear and hydroelectric would face lower taxes or no taxes. To be effective, the tax should also be applied to imported goods from countries that do not assess a similar levy on the use of fossil fuels.

Many countries already have some version of carbon taxes. In the United States, for example, federal and state taxes on gasoline and diesel, which are used to pay for road and transit projects, are effectively carbon taxes. But at the federal level, those taxes have not been increased since 1993, which has eroded their effectiveness.

Revenue generated by carbon taxes could be used for a variety of purposes. A lot of the money should surely be given to households, especially the poorest, through tax credits or direct payments to offset the higher prices they would have to pay for gasoline, electricity and other goods and services because of the tax. Some of the money could be used to invest in renewable energy and public transportation, or to lower other taxes.

British Columbia started phasing in a carbon tax in 2008 and used the revenue to reduce income taxes. The province’s fossil fuel use fell after the tax was put in place, even as fuel consumption increased in the rest of Canada, and the economy of British Columbia has grown faster than that of the rest of the country. The tax is currently capped at 30 Canadian dollars per ton of carbon, or about 24 cents per gallon of gasoline.

A carbon tax would also be much easier to administer than some of the other climate change policies that many leaders, including President Obama and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, have backed. One of those policies is cap-and-trade, an approach that limits overall emissions and allows businesses to buy and sell permits that entitle them to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The United States used cap-and-trade successfully in the 1990s to reduce the pollution that causes acid rain. But a European Union trading system for greenhouse gas emissions has not been as effective.

Even energy companies like Exxon Mobil that did not sign the letter have previously said they can support a carbon tax if lawmakers cut other taxes by an equal amount. In addition, oil companies in Alberta, the home of Canada’s tar sands, have endorsed a carbon tax. Exxon Mobil and other large energy companies potentially stand to benefit from a carbon tax, because a tax on emissions would force many electric utilities to use more natural gas, which those businesses produce.

Of course, getting lawmakers to adopt a carbon tax will be difficult. In the United States, many Republican lawmakers, the coal-mining industry and politically powerful corporations like Koch Industries oppose it. Just last year, Australia repealed its carbon tax after a new conservative government came to power.

But world leaders, who will meet in Paris later this year to negotiate a climate change agreement, cannot give up in the face of this opposition.

1318,"Stocks in the United States bounced back on Wednesday, a day after another sell-off on the global markets, even as worries about economic growth persisted.

The decline on Tuesday followed a weak Chinese report on manufacturing that heightened broader concerns about global economic growth. Some analysts said it was too early to tell whether Wednesday’s market gains were a sign that stocks were close to bottoming out.

“We are getting a little bit of a letup today, but the headache may continue,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at KeyBank.

The Shanghai composite index closed down 0.2 percent on Wednesday, leaving it almost 40 percent lower than its recent peak. A late rally was driven by huge trading volume, suggesting government intervention in the market.

The weakness in Chinese shares was by no means the worst the country has seen over the last month, but coming ahead of closely stage-managed celebrations in China to commemorate the end of World War II, it has raised concerns about Beijing’s ability to manage economic growth.

In particular, international investors and economists worry that heavy-handed state intervention to prop up sagging stocks, and poor communication before a currency devaluation in August, signal uncharacteristic sloppiness from the technocrats who have guided China’s steady rise in gross domestic product over the last three decades.

“There are growing doubts about China’s leadership and the direction of the economy,” Alex Wolf, an emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments, wrote in a note. “Indeed, some have even begun to question whether the Chinese government has ‘lost control’ of the economy.”

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved up slightly on Wednesday, to 2.19 percent from 2.16 percent on Tuesday. Yields move in the opposite direction from prices. Investors have often piled into United States government bonds as a safe-haven investment during periods of instability in the markets. But the 10-year note has not rallied sharply during the latest sell-off in the stock market.

Some analysts said this could indicate that most investors were not expecting a severe downturn.

“Bonds would be showing a lot more activity if investors felt this was going to lead to a recession or a bear market,” Mr. McCain of KeyBank said.

Major European indexes moved higher. The FTSE 100-stock index in London ended up 0.4 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.3 percent.

Despite the worries about China, most analysts say they believe that the country will be able to avoid a sharp economic slowdown. But restoring confidence in its stock markets, they say, will require continued loosening of monetary policy by the Chinese central bank, initiatives like share buybacks from companies and broader market-oriented changes.

The Chinese government’s continued direct intervention in the market, on the other hand, will strengthen concerns, according to an analyst’s note from Citibank.

“Significant reduction of administrative intervention into domestic equities is more important to regain global investors’ confidence,” the note said.

Even so, China’s largest brokerage firms, under the direction of regulators, have vowed to pour in additional investments to support the equity markets, according to a number of recent filings with the stock exchanges. For example, in a note on Tuesday, Haitong Securities said it would invest an additional 4.5 billion renminbi, or roughly $700 million, on top of the 15 billion renminbi it had pledged to a stock market bailout fund.

The move was made “to maintain the long-term stability of the securities market, promote the positive role of a securities company and fulfill its corporate social responsibility,” Haitong said in its filing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Though analysts say such moves will eventually help support the market, many also worry that the measures indicate that the broader Chinese economy could be in worse shape than official data suggests.",U.S. Stock Markets End Higher Though Global Concerns Linger,2015-09-03,Some analysts said it was too early to tell whether the increases on Wednesday were a sign that stocks were close to bottoming out.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/business/dealbook/daily-stock-market-activity.html

The sell-off was broad; all 10 major sectors in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index were lower.

More worries about slower growth in China pushed commodities to two-week lows, with copper prices and industrial metals leading losses. United States crude oil also settled lower.

Shares of the suppliers BorgWarner, Honeywell and Delphi Automotive fell after Volkswagen, the German carmaker, admitted to cheating on vehicle emission tests. BorgWarner shares were down 7.6 percent, while Honeywell fell 1.7 percent, and Delphi lost 3.6 percent.

Goldman Sachs fell 2 percent to $179.72 and was the biggest drag on the Dow after its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said he had a “highly curable” form of lymphoma.

European shares were also stung by the commodities sell-off. The Pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index finished down 3.3 percent.

Copper prices were down 3.6 percent after touching three-week lows, while oil was off 2 percent. China’s efforts to stimulate growth by easing fiscal and monetary policy have not calmed nerves in global markets.

“Investors are nervous because there is a sense that the Fed knows more than it is letting on regarding the health of the global economy,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

The sell-offs in stocks and commodities raised the prices of United States Treasuries and other government debt. The price of benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose, yielding 2.13 percent.

Investors took their cues from the energy markets once again. Oil prices rose for a third day, bouncing back from lows early in the week, which helped lift the battered energy sector. United States crude futures jumped $1.36, or 3.8 percent, to $37.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added $1.25, or 3.5 percent, rising to $37.36 a barrel in London.

Over all, the S.&P. 500 energy sector is up 5.6 percent this week alone. For the year it is still down 21 percent, the most in the S.&P. 500.

In other economic data, the Commerce Department said factory orders for long-lasting goods like automobiles, airplanes and electronics were flat in November, as the impact of a strong dollar and a struggling global economy weighed on United States manufacturers. Orders for capital goods not including aircraft, a key proxy for business investment, fell 0.4 percent.

In other trading, stock in Nike fell $3.14, or 2.4 percent, to $128.71, after the company reported revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts. Nike is still the biggest winner in the Dow average this year, with a gain of 34 percent.

Twitter and Facebook to Post Earnings

Two of the most popular social media services will report their second-quarter financial results this week. Twitter will post its results on Tuesday after the market close. The microbroadcasting service has warned Wall Street several times, most recently in June, not to expect blowout revenue numbers. And analysts expect weak to no growth in the number of people using the service. Investors are more interested in how Twitter’s interim chief executive, Jack Dorsey, fields questions about his dual role at Twitter and Square and whether he announces any initiatives or products. The company may report on progress in the search for a permanent chief executive.

Expectations are higher for Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 1.4 billion users, which will share its results on Wednesday after the market close. The company’s stock is trading near a record high, and investors will want to see evidence that recent torrid growth is continuing. Video advertising has been growing rapidly, and the company’s Instagram photo-sharing app has said it will open the service to many more ads. Expenses have been rising as Facebook invests heavily to complete newer projects, such as the Oculus virtual reality headsets due early next year, and longer-term initiatives like beaming the Internet to the world’s unconnected via lasers and drones. —Vindu Goel

Results From Europe’s Biggest Lenders

Bank earnings reports are expected to kick into high gear this week as several of Europe’s biggest lenders report their first-half results. European lenders reporting their second-quarter results include the Swiss bank UBS; the British lenders Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group; the Spanish bank Santander; the German lender Deutsche Bank; and the French bank BNP Paribas. Merger and acquisition advisory fees and equity trading have been strong for investment banks that have reported so far, as deal activity has been healthy this year. Initial public offerings, however, have been lighter in Europe this year than last year, which set a breakneck pace. Another big question for many of Europe’s biggest investment banks will be the performance of their fixed-income operations — particularly as uncertainty about Greece’s financial future weighed on market activity in June. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs both reported declines in their fixed-income trading revenue during the second quarter, and weakness in that business cut into Credit Suisse’s results in the quarter. —Chad Bray

Fed’s Policy-Making Committee to Meet

Windows 10 Will be Available to Some

Every few years, Microsoft introduces a new version of its operating system, Windows — one of the world’s most widely used software products. That time has come again, and now Microsoft is taking a different approach to get users to download the software as soon as possible. On Wednesday, Microsoft will make Windows 10, its newest offering, available for a first wave of consumers to download onto their existing computers. The update will be available to these users free, a first for Microsoft.

Microsoft is hoping users update to Windows 10 because they see value in new features like Cortana, a virtual assistant that schedules appointments and performs other tasks. Windows 10 will also give Microsoft a common operating system that powers PCs, smartphones, game consoles and other devices.

Its biggest imperative is to create a huge market for Windows 10 devices, thus attracting app-writing developers, who have drifted away from Microsoft toward Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS mobile operating systems. —Nick Wingfield

Oil Earnings

It is earnings week for the oil majors. Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total will all report their second-quarter results. The news will probably be disappointing but not surprising; oil prices are half what they were a year ago. These integrated companies, though, should do better than smaller oil companies and service companies because the larger organizations run refineries, which are earning profits since demand for gasoline has been rising. —Clifford Krauss

United States Economic Growth Estimate

On Thursday, the United States Department of Commerce will announce its initial estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. Experts estimate that after an unexpected drop in output in the first three months of the year, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent last quarter. The rebound was probably driven by healthy consumer spending, strong growth in residential real estate spending and government expenditures, and an improved trade picture. —Nelson D. Schwartz

Time Warner Cable Results

Time Warner Cable is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on Thursday, its first earnings report since the cable company announced its $56.7 billion sale to Charter Communications. The transaction is part of a pair of deals Charter announced in May that, if approved, would create the country’s second-largest cable and broadband operator, with 24 million customers in 41 states.

Wall Street will be looking for clues about how regulators view the deal. Time Warner Cable’s previous deal with Comcast collapsed under intense regulatory pressure. In addition, investors will be looking for whether Time Warner Cable managed to sustain the strong performance it reported during the first quarter, when it delivered its strongest subscriber growth in years. —Emily Steel

1333,"Republicans and the oil industry had demanded that the president approve the pipeline, which they said would create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Many Democrats, particularly those in oil-producing states such as North Dakota, also supported the project. In February, congressional Democrats joined with Republicans in sending Mr. Obama a bill to speed approval of the project, but the president vetoed the measure.

The rejection of the pipeline is one of several actions Mr. Obama has taken as he intensifies his push on climate change in his last year in office. In August, he announced his most significant climate policy, a set of aggressive new regulations to cut emissions of planet-warming carbon pollution from the nation’s power plants.

Both sides of the debate saw the Keystone rejection as a major symbolic step, a sign that the president was willing to risk angering a bipartisan majority of lawmakers in the pursuit of his environmental agenda. And both supporters and critics of Mr. Obama saw the surprisingly powerful influence of environmental activists in the decision.

“Once the grass-roots movement on the Keystone pipeline mobilized, it changed what it meant to the president,” said Douglas G. Brinkley, a historian at Rice University who writes about presidential environmental legacies. “It went from a routine infrastructure project to the symbol of an era.”

Environmental activists cheered the decision as a vindication of their influence.

“President Obama is the first world leader to reject a project because of its effect on the climate,” said Bill McKibben, founder of the activist group 350.org, which led the campaign against the pipeline. “That gives him new stature as an environmental leader, and it eloquently confirms the five years and millions of hours of work that people of every kind put into this fight.”

Environmentalists had sought to block construction of the pipeline because it would have provided a conduit for petroleum extracted from the Canadian oil sands. The process of extracting that oil produces about 17 percent more planet-warming greenhouse gases than the process of extracting conventional oil.

But numerous State Department reviews concluded that construction of the pipeline would have little impact on whether that type of oil was burned, because it was already being extracted and moving to market via rail and existing pipelines. In citing his reason for the decision, Mr. Obama noted the State Department findings that construction of the pipeline would not have created a significant number of new jobs, lowered oil or gasoline prices or significantly reduced American dependence on foreign oil.

“From a market perspective, the industry can find a different way to move that oil,” said Christine Tezak, an energy market analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington firm. “How long it takes is just a result of oil prices. If prices go up, companies will get the oil out.”

However, a State Department review also found that demand for the oil sands fuel would drop if oil prices fell below $65 a barrel, since moving oil by rail is more expensive than using a pipeline. An Environmental Protection Agency review of the project this year noted that under such circumstances, construction of the pipeline could be seen as contributing to emissions, since companies might be less likely to move the oil via expensive rail when oil prices are low — but would be more likely to move it cheaply via the pipeline. The price of oil has plummeted this year, hovering at less than $50 a barrel.

The recent election of a new Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, may also have influenced Mr. Obama’s decision. Mr. Trudeau’s predecessor, Stephen Harper, had pushed the issue as a top priority in the relationship between the United States and Canada, personally urging Mr. Obama to approve the project. Blocking the project during the Harper administration would have bruised ties with a crucial ally.

While Mr. Trudeau also supports construction of the Keystone pipeline, he has not made the issue central to Canada’s relationship with the United States, and has criticized Mr. Harper for presenting Canada’s position as an ultimatum, while not taking substantial action on climate change related to the oil sands.

Mr. Trudeau did not raise the issue during his first post-election conversation with Mr. Obama.

The construction would have had little impact on the nation’s economy. A State Department analysis concluded that building the pipeline would have created jobs, but the total number represented less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation’s total employment. The analysis estimated that Keystone would support 42,000 temporary jobs over its two-year construction period — about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest in indirect support jobs, such as food service. The department estimated that the project would create about 35 permanent jobs.

Republicans and the oil industry criticized Mr. Obama for what they have long said was his acquiescence to the pressure of activists and environmentally minded political donors.

“A decision this poorly made is not symbolic, but deeply cynical,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who leads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “It does not rest on the facts — it continues to distort them.”

Jack Gerard, the head of the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for oil companies, said in a statement, “Unfortunately for the majority of Americans who have said they want the jobs and economic benefits Keystone XL represents, the White House has placed political calculations above sound science.”

Russ Girling, the president and chief executive of TransCanada, said in a statement that the president’s decision was not consistent with the State Department’s review. “Today, misplaced symbolism was chosen over merit and science,” said Mr. Girling, whose company is based in Calgary, Alberta. “Rhetoric won out over reason.”

The statement said that the company was reviewing the decision but offered no indication if it planned to submit a new application. If a Republican wins the 2016 presidential election, a new submission of the pipeline permit application could yield a different outcome.

“President Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline is a huge mistake, and is the latest reminder that this administration continues to prioritize the demands of radical environmentalists over America’s energy security,” said Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president. “When I’m president, Keystone will be approved, and President Obama’s backward energy policies will come to an end.”

As Mr. Obama seeks to carve out a substantial environmental legacy, his decision on the pipeline pales in import compared with his use of Environmental Protection Agency regulations. The power plant rules he announced in August have met with legal challenges, but if they are put in place, they could lead to a transformation of the nation’s energy economy, shuttering fossil fuel plants and rapidly increasing production of wind and solar.

Those rules are at the heart of Mr. Obama’s push for a global agreement.

But advocates of the agreement said that the Keystone decision, even though it is largely symbolic, could show other countries that Mr. Obama is willing to make tough choices about climate change.

“The rejection of the Keystone permit was key for the president to keep his climate chops at home and with the rest of the world,” said Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a Washington research organization.","Citing Climate Change, Obama Rejects Construction of Keystone XL Oil Pipeline",2015-11-07,The president’s decision was a major victory for environmentalists and a bitter loss for the oil industry.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/obama-expected-to-reject-construction-of-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline.html

In company news, SABMiller, a major beer maker whose brands include Miller and Foster’s, jumped 20 percent in London after the company said it received a takeover offer from Anheuser-Busch InBev of Belgium. The combination would create a massive conglomerate worth $275 billion. Any potential deal would be heavily scrutinized by regulators.

1. Donald Trump‘s call to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. may have been his most effective remark yet in getting him attention. In the day since, he’s been in headlines around the world. Much of the attention was critical, but Mr. Trump and his supporters appeared unshaken.

3. Presidential rivals of both parties seemed to resent what Jeb Bush called Mr. Trump’s playing the media “like a fine Stradivarius violin.” The Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders was in Baltimore, in the impoverished neighborhood where Freddie Gray was arrested. When asked about the Islamic State, Mr. Sanders pushed back, saying, “Obviously ISIS and terrorism are a huge national issue that we’ve got to address, but so is poverty, so is unemployment, so is education, so is health care.”

5. U.S. police chiefs say their work and job security have been radically altered by more than a year of intense scrutiny prompted by brutal videos and accusations of abusive behavior. In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who fired his police chief last week, lashed out at the force over a newly released video from 2012 showing officers shocking a 38-year-old man with a Taser and then dragging him by his handcuffs.

Beijing felt its way through its first red alert on pollution, closing schools and factories and limiting the number of cars on the road. “Air pollution is a huge problem that we ignored early on, while we concentrated on economic development,” a university lecturer said. “Now we are paying the price for that.” International climate talks continue in Paris through Friday.

8. The London-based mining firm Anglo American drastically expanded cutbacks, slashing 85,000 jobs — two thirds of its work force. That’s just the latest shakeout in the commodities sector as oil prices and iron ore continue their long drop.

U.S. stocks fell for a second day. The Dow Jones recovered after a fall, closing down 0.9 percent. The S.&P. 500 lost 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq slipped just 0.1 percent.

1337,"Stocks retreated modestly on Wednesday after comments from Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve’s chairwoman, implied that Fed policy makers were still considering raising interest rates in December.

Ms. Yellen’s comments pushed the dollar higher. That had a secondary impact of causing oil to fall, which affected oil, gas and energy stocks. Government bond prices also fell.

Media and entertainment stocks were pummeled after worrisome comments from the media conglomerate Time Warner.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 50.57 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,867.58. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 7.48 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,102.31, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.65 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,142.48.

During testimony before Congress, Ms. Yellen said that an interest rate increase in December would be a “live possibility” if the economy stayed on track. She stressed that no decision had been made yet, and a move in December would depend on how the economy fared until then.

At its Dec. 15-16 meeting, the Fed will consider raising a benchmark interest rate from a record low of near zero if the economy continues to grow at a pace strong enough to keep adding jobs and push annual inflation toward the Fed’s 2 percent target, Ms. Yellen said.

Once considered unlikely, a December rate increase seems more likely by the day.

Stocks have recovered nearly all of their losses from the summer, financial markets have calmed in China and elsewhere, and the United States economy continues to slowly improve.

Securities that allow investors to bet on which way the Fed will move interest rates are now pricing in a roughly 60 percent chance of the Fed raising rates next month, according to data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

“Everyone is so focused on the world’s central banks at the moment, they don’t seem to care about anything else,” said Colleen S. Supran of the wealth management firm Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough.

Investors will closely parse the October jobs report, which is due out on Friday. Investors expect that United States employers added 185,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.1 percent.

Oil and gas stocks were among the shares affected the most, inadvertently, by Ms. Yellen’s comments. Her remarks caused the dollar to strengthen and oil prices to decline sharply.

Crude oil fell $1.58, or 3.3 percent, to $46.32 a barrel, reversing after two days of gains. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell $1.96, or 4 percent, to $48.58 a barrel.

“Today’s sell-off was easily definable by some hawkish comments” by Ms. Yellen, Jim Ritterbusch, of the oil trading firm Ritterbusch & Associates, wrote in a note.

Some of the biggest gainers on Monday and Tuesday were among the biggest decliners on Wednesday. The oil field servicing company Baker Hughes fell $2.90, or 5.3 percent, to $51.56. Newfield Exploration lost $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $38.30.

Media companies were another weak spot in the market. They fell sharply after Time Warner gave a worrisome earnings forecast for 2016. The company cited concerns about “cord cutting,” a phenomenon that has been increasing in recent years in which longtime cable TV subscribers have canceled or substantially curtailed their subscriptions, opting for cheaper services like HBO Go and Netflix.

Time Warner fell $5.10, or 6.6 percent, to $72.20; Viacom fell $3.37, or 6.6 percent, to $47.92; and 21st Century Fox lost $1.63, or 5.2 percent, to $29.65.

Netflix gained $4.31, or 4 percent, to $114.05.

Bond prices fell, mostly as a result of Ms. Yellen’s comments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.23 percent from 2.22 percent the day before.

Precious and industrial metals futures closed lower. Gold fell $7.70, to $1,106.20 an ounce; silver lost 18 cents, to $15.06 an ounce; and copper edged down less than a penny, to $2.32 a pound.

In the rest of the energy market, wholesale gasoline fell 5.4 cents, to $1.392 a gallon in New York; heating oil fell 6.3 cents, to $1.504 a gallon; and natural gas rose 0.9 cents, to $2.262 per 1,000 cubic feet.",Market Retreats as Oil Prices and Media Shares Fall,2015-11-05,"Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve.

1339,"Mr. Mariscal added that investors might have expected the adjustment to be a 2 percent decline in a year, not 2 percent in a day.

The move rippled through the markets on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 212.33 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 17,402.84. The Standard & Poor’s 500, a broader index favored by investors, declined by 0.96 percent to close at 2,084.07.

Oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, declined by 3.75 percent to $43.35 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury note, a safe haven on troubled days in the market, rose in price, pushing its yield down to 2.137 percent. The currencies of Asian countries, including South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, declined on Tuesday.

As investors grope for explanations for the devaluation, they point to the need for stemming capital outflows from the country, which have picked up in recent months. It is an indication, at least somewhat, that Chinese investors — fearing their currency was overvalued and a devaluation was coming — are looking for better opportunities elsewhere.

“All this hot money outflow was people in China realizing they had an overvalued currency — and spending when they could,” said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. But there is a danger that the capital outflows may now speed up, if the Chinese investors believe the renminbi could be devalued again.

The sharp reaction among investors also reflects the mistrust toward economic data coming out of China. While the country’s goal is to grow 7 percent this year, a report last week from Bank of America Merrill Lynch caused a particular stir in the markets. It cited data that suggested China’s economy may already be in a ditch, including figures showing that power generation was flattening, cement production contracting and steel output slowing.

The murkiness of China’s numbers means that global investors could remain jittery in coming weeks as they pore over every report about the country’s economy. If more signs of slowing emerge, investors might expect a further devaluation.

That, in turn, could prompt other countries to devalue, to prevent Chinese exporters from gaining an outsize advantage in world markets. If that happens, fears of a full-on currency war would soon grip the markets.

In a sign of how fears about China can have negative consequences far afield, stock markets and currencies fell in Latin America on Tuesday. Countries in the region are big exporters to China and in recent years they have also received substantial investments from the country. Seeing trouble in China might cause other investors in Latin America to pull back.

“Everyone has to back up and at least put their projects on pause when China has to tweak more than the stock market to get its economy growing as quickly as it did in the past,” said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial.

Russia, too, is watching closely. Any further slowdown in China — its largest trading partner — could weigh on Russia, at a time when it is already dealing with the dual headwinds of Western sanctions and low oil prices. On Tuesday, the Russian ruble was off roughly 2 percent.

The United States economy would most likely get hit if China and many other countries continued to devalue. American companies would find it harder to export, depressing their earnings. “We thought we were at the end of the stronger dollar cycle — and clearly this could extend it,” Mr. Mariscal said.

Still, some analysts say the fretting has gone too far. In devaluing, China’s authorities, they assert, acted mostly out of a long-term desire to allow the market to have a greater role in setting the level of its currency.

“We take China policy makers at their word that this is meant to introduce greater market forces into determining the exchange rate,” Brown Brothers Harriman said in a research note on Tuesday, adding that any further declines are likely to be restrained. The country also has billions of dollars in reserves that it can use to influence the exchange rate and put out financial fires.

Others said that the devaluation was sensible because the currency was becoming quite overvalued, and was merely a catch-up move that would have benefits for the economy. “China’s wages haven’t increased and their cost base hasn’t gone up,” Mr. Lele said, “but they have been slowly becoming less competitive.” And by loosening the way it manages its currency, China in effect will gain more flexibility in conducting its domestic monetary policy, leeway it will need as it tries to stimulate the economy, Mr. Lele contended.

Even so, China will most likely remain a big worry among investors until it posts strong and convincing growth figures. Some investors are wondering whether China is just another emerging market, vulnerable to global money flows.

As the Federal Reserve now prepares to raise interest rates, the supply of dollars around the world has slowed, causing financial havoc in many developing countries. That tightening could make life harder for China — and the authorities there may already have seen that.

“The growth scare is what is affecting the markets right now,” Mr. Mariscal said. “They are worried that Chinese growth is much, much weaker than people expected.”",Global Selling Shows Concerns About China’s Weakness,2015-08-12,"After China devalued its currency, the price of oil plunged and stock markets fell, reflecting worry that the country’s leaders would be unable to bolster the economy.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/business/dealbook/global-selling-shows-concerns-about-chinas-weakness.html
1340,"“A Fed hike is not going to knock out emerging markets like Indonesia,” said Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong. “But things are bound to get a little tougher from here.”

Parallels between the current downturn and the financial crisis in the late 1990s are difficult to escape. Then, turmoil erupted when currencies around the region began to plunge, setting off a chain reaction of defaults among companies that had borrowed heavily from foreign investors.

At that time, some two-thirds of the Tanotos’ sprawling mill and plantation complex on the island of Sumatra was still under construction, with projects totaling roughly $2 billion. The project’s three sources of funding — local banks, foreign banks and export credit agencies — dried up almost overnight.

“Everything wrong happened at the same time,” the elder Mr. Tanoto said.

After that crisis, a bank controlled by Mr. Tanoto collapsed and, later, he lost control of Adaro Energy, a huge coal mining business on Borneo. His palm oil operation had to pay a record fine of about 2.5 trillion rupiah, or about $180 million at today’s exchange rates, for tax evasion. The company disputes the allegations of unpaid taxes and continues to challenge the matter in the courts.

In the current environment, the operation is focused on keeping down costs by increasing efficiency. At an on-site laboratory, scientists cross different types of palm oil trees, trying to develop a variety that yields more oil and better resists disease. The trees are also bred to be shorter, so it is easier to harvest their fruit.

The company is also trying to reduce its reliance on lower-value bulk commodities. The roughly 400,000 tons of freshly cut acacia trees stacked in towering piles surrounding the mill are waiting to be turned into pulp that the company dries into sheets for export. With the mill expansion, it will be able to make more of its own Paper One brand here, which it can sell for a higher price.

Prices of pulp and paper have proved to be more resilient than those of palm oil. So far, none of the major paper companies are showing the stress that appeared in the late 1990s, when the conglomerate’s larger competitor, Asia Pulp & Paper, defaulted on nearly $14 billion in foreign debt.

While Indonesia does not appear to be headed for a repeat of the earlier crisis, the problems today are similar, if on a smaller scale. As they did then, some companies have taken advantage of years of easy credit to take on more debt than they can handle.

Hotman Paris Hutapea, a Jakarta lawyer who defended Asia Pulp & Paper from its foreign creditors, says he is seeing a sharp pickup in new cases today.

Mr. Hutapea’s most recent big case involved defending one of Indonesia’s largest shipping companies, PT Arpeni Pratama Ocean Line — with total debt of nearly $500 million — from legal actions by creditors. One of the company’s insurers filed an action this summer seeking to declare the shipper bankrupt over unpaid bills.

“The problems started in mining, because they shipped a lot of coal to China,” he said. “I’m not an economist, but if a shipping company runs out of business, it means all its customers are also seeing a drop.”

“Luckily, I won the case in the commercial court and the Supreme Court, mostly on the basis of some technicalities,” Mr. Hutapea added.

The slump that started in commodities and industrial firms is spreading to other parts of the economy. For years, sales of mobile phones rose fast, a tangible sign of the newfound buying power of Indonesia’s rapidly growing middle class.

Now consumers are pulling back. In November, PT Trikomsel Oke, one of the country’s biggest mobile phone retailers, which is owned in part by the SoftBank Group of Japan, defaulted when it missed a payment on about $150 million in bonds sold in Singapore. The company said it had about $460 million in debt due in the next two years that it would be unable to pay.

“Consumer staples, goods and services companies that used to be very robust — that part of the economy is now taking a slowdown,” said Sandiaga S. Uno, a co-founder of the Indonesian private equity group Saratoga Capital.

Trikomsel, the mobile phone retailer, has blamed the shrinking budgets of Indonesian consumers, who are favoring cheaper products. The weakened rupiah is also a factor, since most phones are imported. Smartphone sales volumes fell by 7 percent in the third quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2014, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

On a recent visit to one of Trikomsel’s retailing outlets at the upscale Taman Anggrek mall in Jakarta, the store was empty apart from a lone cashier, Ibham, 26, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. “The end of the year is usually a busy season,” he said, “but maybe less so this year because the currency is weaker.”

The broader telecom sector, a major focus of foreign investors in recent years, has been scrambling to limit its pain.

Indosat Ooredoo, Indonesia’s second-biggest mobile service provider, which is majority owned by the government of Qatar, continues to add new subscribers. But Alexander Rusli, the company’s chief executive, says the slumping currency has hurt its ability to expand and upgrade its coverage network because it has made imported equipment more expensive.

As it hunkers down, Indosat is reducing its dollar-denominated debt in favor of debt in the local currency. It is also exploring pricing contracts with suppliers like Huawei of China in that country’s currency, to further diversify its currency exposure.

While Royal Golden Eagle is similarly preparing for the new reality, Sukanto Tanoto remains optimistic. Rising rates and slower growth in China may complicate his business plans, but they do not spell disaster.

“Doing the commodity business with China is like drinking coffee,” Mr. Tanoto said. “We enjoyed three spoons of sugar per cup for a long time. Suddenly, when that’s cut to one and a half spoons, we feel bitter — because it used to be so sweet.”",Higher Interest Rates Lower Expectations in Emerging Economies,2015-12-22,"As in many emerging economies, companies in Indonesia gorged on cheap debt to fund expansion.

1341,"GRANITE CITY, Ill. — A thousand miles south of this gritty steel town on the Mississippi River, West Texas oil rigs have shuddered to a halt. Seven hundred miles north, mines in the Iron Range of Minnesota have been stilled.

The drilling rigs, with their deep underground pipes, once consumed much of the steel that Granite City’s blast furnaces could produce, while the mines supplied the raw material.

So now, more than 2,000 workers at the mammoth United States Steel plant not far from St. Louis are waiting to see if they will be next. This month, the company warned them it might be forced to idle the plant. Layoffs could begin around Christmas.

Granite City may be waiting, but a chill in economic activity is already evident across a broad swath of the nation’s heartland stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border, as prices of commodities sink.

Whether it is roustabouts and other oil field workers in Texas and North Dakota, miners in Minnesota, farmers in Iowa, or heavy equipment makers and sellers in Illinois, the reason for the fear is the same: a sudden plunge in demand for commodities.

“Everybody is scared to death, and we’re anticipating the worst,” said Mike McCabe, 53, a second-generation steelworker who has spent nearly two decades working in the furnace where molten iron and scrap metal are transformed into steel. “They pay us to make pipe. That’s what we do. But the rumor is that the order book is terrible.”

The fall in prices for a variety of products, including crude oil, iron ore and agricultural crops like corn and soybeans is reminiscent of the collapse of the technology boom in 2000 or the bursting of the housing bubble nearly a decade ago. And behind the pain and anxiety are headwinds blowing from China and other emerging markets, where growth is slowing and demand for the raw materials that drive the global economy has dried up.

Even as the American economy continues to plow ahead, nerves are increasingly on edge. Investors and banks that lent eagerly to energy and mining giants when prices were high are worried about whether they will be repaid if prices stay low. Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said in late September it would cut up to 10,000 jobs, a casualty of falling demand for its trademark yellow bulldozers and excavators.

A few days after Caterpillar’s decision, Alcoa announced it would split in two to help cope with the slide in aluminum prices. DuPont, which has been under pressure to perform a similar breakup because of weak chemical prices, said in early October that its chief executive was stepping down and that it would cut costs more aggressively.

In Texas, energy companies and other natural resource businesses have eliminated 25,000 jobs this year. Sparsely populated North Dakota, where fortunes soared with the shale oil fracking boom, has lost more than 10,000 jobs, with some of its hastily built new housing now empty.

For the farm belt, which largely sidestepped the damage wreaked by the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the economic turnabout has been especially sharp. The Agriculture Department forecasts that farm income, adjusted for inflation, will fall 54 percent from where it was two years ago — the third-lowest level since the 1980s. Corn, the most valuable crop in the country, has fallen to $3.78 a bushel from $7.50 three years ago.

“I think a lot of farmers are starting to realize that these price levels may not be temporary,” said Nathan Kauffman, the Omaha branch executive with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.

Still, for all the rising fears across the nation’s midsection, the end of the long boom in commodities cuts both ways. Unlike the housing bust, which benefited no one but a few prescient short-sellers, the price collapse has a countervailing positive impact for consumers and some other businesses.

The 37 percent drop in gasoline prices since the summer of 2014 is the equivalent of a $100 billion tax cut, providing much-needed relief while wages remain stuck. Food prices, too, have declined, with chicken costing 8 percent less than a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Milk is cheaper, and prices of goods from abroad, like coffee, are down.

Airlines are rejoicing at lower prices for fuel, which makes up 40 percent of their costs. For the first time in years, airlines can buy new planes, invest in new facilities and give bonuses to employees, while paying dividends to shareholders. With gasoline prices low, automakers are raking in healthy profits from selling shiny new pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.

“There are winners and there are losers,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research firm that tracks the economy. “But there is no question that there are pockets of real pain out there.”

Years of Plenty

Commodity producers are used to regular booms and busts, but the so-called supercycle driven by China’s once insatiable appetite for raw materials has been extraordinary by any standard. Edward L. Morse, Citigroup’s global head of commodities research, likens China’s boom to the three decades after World War II when Europe was rebuilt, or the Gilded Age industrialization of the United States in the half-century after the Civil War.

“The last 20 years have been mind-boggling,” Mr. Morse said. “Between 1993 and 2013, China built 200 cities of a million people or more. This was incredibly intensive in terms of steel and copper and other commodities.”",A Global Chill in Commodity Demand Hits America’s Heartland,2015-10-25,"In China and other emerging markets, growth is waning and demand for the raw materials that drive the global economy has dried up.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/business/energy-environment/americas-heartland-feels-a-chill-from-collapsing-commodity-prices.html

ATHENS — The sun shone, as usual, with clouds floating in a brilliant blue sky above the Acropolis. Hotels were mostly full, shops sold T-shirts and the cafes along the narrow alleyways in the Plaka tourist district were bustling.

It was a seemingly normal Sunday — except it was anything but normal.

For many people in Athens, it was time to prepare for an approaching storm. A short walk from Plaka, a line of people waited to withdraw cash from an A.T.M., hours before the official announcement that banks would be closed starting on Monday. Some bank machines in central Athens had run out of money or were out of service, as screens blamed “technical difficulties.”

Elsewhere, some people had started hoarding gasoline and groceries. “We don’t know what the new day will bring,” said Katerina Vorreadi, who was among a group of retirees waiting in line outside the National Bank of Greece on Saturday night.

Five years of economic misery have taught many Greeks how to endure hardship, and with the nation now facing a new crisis, the weekend response in Athens was a blend of anxiety and defiance, fear and weary resignation, but also an angry pride.

There was no panic on the streets, even as the breakdown of negotiations in Brussels between the leftist government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and the country’s creditors could ultimately push Greece out of the eurozone.

In Syntagma Square, which sits below the Greek Parliament and has been the setting for some of the angriest protests against economic austerity measures in recent years, the mood was tranquil. The most noticeable sign of change was an increase in police patrols, with some officers in bulletproof vests stationed near A.T.M.s. Police officials confirmed that vacations had been canceled for the coming week to prepare for the national referendum called by Mr. Tsipras.

Photo

Mr. Tsipras’s surprise decision to hold the referendum on July 5 — endorsed by Parliament — is now the topic across the capital. Mr. Tsipras has said that voters must decide in a yes-or-no vote whether to accept an aid proposal that he considers onerous.

Many people watched the televised parliamentary debate, even as it stretched into Sunday morning. Mr. Tsipras finally spoke at almost 2 a.m., describing how the creditor plan would raise taxes and hurt pensioners and consign Greece to an endless cycle of austerity. “Of course I stayed up,” said Alekos Nikas, 72, a retired laborer on a government pension. “I get 560 euros a month in pension!”

On Sunday, Mr. Nikas sat at a cafe with a friend, Vassilis Vangelidis, 65, and two other men. They described how they struggled to survive on modest pensions and agreed with Mr. Tsipras’s refusal to submit to pension cuts proposed by creditors.

Photo

“He did the right thing,” Mr. Nikas said. “We’re all pensioners here. They have already slashed so much. If he fights back, we might salvage something.”

Mr. Vangelidis agreed — yet he worried about the consequences of default and leaving the euro. “We will lose everything,” he warned. “There will be no food or fuel. We will be like Venezuela.”

To some people, even those who supported the idea of the referendum, the practical impact remained unclear. Opposition parties are already arguing that a no vote would be akin to voting to leave the eurozone. Mr. Tsipras has said that the referendum is solely focused on the terms of the latest creditor proposal, but most Greeks know little about the details of that proposal or whether a no vote could threaten Greece’s place in the eurozone.

Timeline: Greek Debt Crisis What you need to know »

Fotis Bitsakos, 39, and his wife, Marina Lianidi, 30, were spending Sunday with their two young sons. She is unemployed and he had lost one job before finding another. Both voted for Mr. Tsipras’s left-leaning Syriza Party in the January national elections because they felt that Greece needed somehow to break the prevailing cycle of hardship. And both say that even the dire prospect of Greece’s leaving the eurozone is not so worrisome, given what they have already been through.

Even so, they admitted confusion about the referendum. “No one has explained what yes means, what no means,” Mr. Bitsakos said.

Ms. Lianidi added: “If we say no, we will at least have hit rock bottom and then we can bounce back eventually, instead of getting dragged into the situation where we pay the price — and those who should pay, do not.”

The class divide in Greece has sharpened substantially during the economic crisis, and in the wealthy and aristocratic neighborhood of Kolonaki, there were no lines at the A.T.M.s.

Greek news media have reported that many affluent people, who long dreaded Syriza’s rise, have moved money overseas or stuffed it into safes. Two friends, Pantelis, in a Panama hat, and Christos, in a yellow polo shirt, both engineers, were strolling in the sunshine, mulling the referendum. Neither would give a surname, and neither held out much hope that Syriza was on his side.

“We’ll have a country where only pensioners will have money, and the young will flee,” Christos concluded.

Beside the lines at A.T.M.s, people were also lining up at gas stations and in grocery stories. In the small town of Spata, outside Athens, residents had stripped grocery shelves bare by Saturday night. The local Shell station had run out of regular unleaded and had only premium gasoline to sell. “Doom,” the gas attendant responded, when asked to describe the mood.

The frenzy at gas stations across the country prompted Greece’s largest refiner to issue a statement assuring that there would be enough supply, The Associated Press reported.

Perhaps it was Mr. Vangelidis, at the cafe, who captured the uncertainty of the moment most succinctly. “What will happen tomorrow, no one can know,” he said. “Even the Europeans don’t know.”",Cash Withdrawals and Hoarding as Default Looms Over Greece,2015-06-29,"The response to the breakdown of negotiations in Brussels was a blend of anxiety and defiance, fear and weary resignation, but also an angry pride.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/world/europe/a-wary-athens-awaits-the-referendum-on-austerity.html
1343,"Major stock indexes shook off an early stumble on Friday — falling oil prices pulled oil and gas companies down — to finish the day with slight gains as traders turned their attention to a pivotal meeting of the Federal Reserve next week.

It was a quiet end to another turbulent week. Thanks largely to a big jump on Tuesday, the United States market finished with a 2 percent gain for the week, recouping a portion of the steep losses from the week before.

“It seems people are focused on the market’s volatility and the potential impact of a slowing China,” said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York, the money management firm. “I understand why folks are nervous. I think eventually things will settle down.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 8.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,961.05. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 16,433.09. The Nasdaq rose 26.09, or 0.5 percent, to close at 4,822.34.

News about China’s slowing economy, a looming rate increase from the Fed and a host of other concerns have combined to knock the market down 6 percent over the last month. It has been a staggered fall, with sharp drops one week followed by slight gains the next.

Wall Street is divided over whether the Fed will raise its benchmark lending rate next week for the first time in nine years. The Fed reduced its key rate to near zero during the financial crisis, supporting the stock market’s seven-year run. Uncertainty over the Fed’s timing has kept investors on edge.

Major markets in Europe closed with losses on Friday. The DAX in Germany dropped 0.9 percent, while the CAC-40 in France sank 1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain slipped 0.6 percent.

In China, the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 0.3 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.2 percent.

Back in the United States, Kroger, the grocery store chain, gained 5.3 percent after reporting earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. Kroger’s stock rose $1.89 to $37.29.

Prices for United States government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.19 percent, from 2.23 percent late Thursday.

In the commodity markets, precious and industrial metals finished mostly lower. Gold dropped $6 to settle at $1,103.50 an ounce, and silver sank 14 cents to settle at $14.50 an ounce. Copper settled at $2.45 a pound, unchanged from the day before.

The price of oil fell on concerns that the current glut of oil would persist well into next year. Goldman Sachs cut its prediction for next year’s oil prices to $45 a barrel, down from $57, saying that supplies were far higher than previous estimates. United States crude fell $1.29 to settle at $44.63 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oil, fell 75 cents to settle at $48.14 in London.

1344,"MORE SIGNS OF A SHARPER SLOWDOWN IN CHINA | Once the world’s workshop, China’s exports are facing their most protracted declines since the global financial crisis, Neil Gough writes in The New York Times. China’s trade slump deepened in August — an indication of a sharper industrial slowdown at home and weaker demand from overseas. Exports fell 5.5 percent in August and 1.4 percent in dollar terms in the first eight months of the year. The country’s manufacturing sector is losing competitiveness as labor costs rise and the renminbi remains relatively strong despite its devaluation, making Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers. Imports are falling even more steeply. They fell for the 10th month in a row in August, recording a drop of 14 percent by value. Economists blame the rout in commodity prices, but imports have fallen in volume too. The falling imports of industrial raw materials point to weakening domestic demand, driven by a slump in manufacturing and new housing construction. The weak trade data weighed on markets, with Japan’s main index, the Nikkei 225, closing 2.4 percent lower. In Shanghai, stocks initially fell when the trade figures were released, but heavy buying in the afternoon set off a rally. Shares closed 2.9 percent higher — a pattern seen often in recent weeks, as China’s government appears to continue its efforts to support the slumping stock markets. China’s leadership made the surprise decision last month to devalue the currency by about 3 percent, the renminbi’s sharpest drop in two decades. But the central bank has since intervened in the markets on a massive scale, fighting pressure to weaken the currency further by selling dollars and buying renminbi. As a result, China is burning through foreign exchange reserves at the fastest pace yet. Reserves fell by nearly $100 billion in August alone, though they are still huge at $3.56 trillion. Still, analysts say that the recent devaluation was most likely too modest to give China’s exports much of a boost, and that the exchange rate is still stronger than China’s slowing economic growth would otherwise support.

PATRICK DRAHI, A POTENTIAL PLAYER IN U.S. CABLE | When the French-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi was mentioned as a potential suitor for Time Warner Cable, it may have been the first time many Americans had heard his name. But he is no stranger to American cable, Nicola Clark writes in The New York Times. Mr. Drahi resigned from his job at a Philips fiber-optics lab in 1990, telling his wife he was going to try his hand in the cable industry in the United States, inspired by the significant number of American cable entrepreneurs on the Forbes list of wealthy people. The young engineer then left Paris for the United States and offered his services as a consultant to American cable investors, advising them on European acquisitions. Within three months, he was earning more than he had been making at Philips. Now, 25 years later, Mr. Drahi may be setting off on an American cable-buying spree. He bought Suddenlink Communications, the seventh-largest cable operator in the United States, for $9 billion in May. Time Warner accepted a $56 billion offer from Charter Communications in the end. But Altice, the publicly traded company that Mr. Drahi controls, has never been shy about making debt-driven acquisitions. The Suddenlink deal has set off speculation that the Amsterdam-based company, with a stock market value of nearly $28 billion, may be eyeing midsize American players, including AT&T, Cox Communications, Cablevision or Verizon. This in turn has attracted more investor attention to Mr. Drahi’s strategy. In Europe, he has focused on the convergence of fixed-line cable, Internet services and wireless communications. “Patrick believes that high-speed communications networks today are the equivalent to what networks for water, electricity and railways were to economic development in the 19th and early 20th centuries,” said Jérôme Yomtov, a former investment banker at HSBC who runs Altice’s main French cable and telecommunications business, Numericable-SFR. Analysts estimate that Altice has the financial firepower to pursue up to €30 billion in debt-driven deals, provided that interest rates remain low and the group continues to generate sufficient revenue to service its debts. The company’s borrowing strategy has made some French leaders nervous about its acquisition methods. Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, worried that it might one day require a government bailout to preserve jobs. Mr. Drahi thinks these concerns are overblown. “When you are focused on debt reduction, it’s because you have a growth problem,” Mr. Drahi told a French legislative committee. “If I stop my so-called bulimic development, in five years, I would have no debts,” he said. “And then what? That would be stupid, because I will not have grown for five years.”

DECODING STEVE JOBS | The debate over whether Steve Jobs deserves to be so admired continues, nearly four years after his death, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. When he died, “the grief for Jobs seemed to go beyond the products he left behind,” said Alex Gibney who directed the documentary “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine.” “We mourned the man himself. But why?” The documentary Mr. Gibney directed makes the case that Jobs does not deserve his iconic status, but these efforts to paint Jobs as a hero or a villain miss a larger truth, Mr Sorkin argues: “He can be both and still be worthy of acclaim.” Most people are flawed. The influential can be even more so. Although Mr. Gibney held out that John Lennon and Martin Luther King Jr. were more worthy than Jobs of the outpouring of grief that followed their deaths, they were troubled too. Lennon’s son, Julian, has talked about how he never experienced the peace and love that his father would talk about to the rest of the world. King has been chronicled as a serial adulterer. Jobs also defies simple characterization. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Jonathan Ive, Apple’s famed designer, recalled how he pulled Jobs aside for being too tough on his team , and asked him to be nicer. “Well, why?” Jobs replied. “Because I care about the team,” Mr. Ive responded. “And he said this brutally, brilliantly insightful thing, which was, ‘No, Jony, you’re just really vain,’” Mr. Ive recalled. “He said, ‘You just want people to like you, and I’m surprised at you because I thought you really held the work up as the most important, not how you believed you were perceived by other people.’” This anecdote and the documentary have left Mr. Sorkin wondering: Would you rather do something extraordinary that benefits the lives of millions or be liked by several hundred? And does it have to be an either-or question?

1345,"MARKETS SLIDE AHEAD OF U.S. JOBS REPORT | Markets were cautious on Friday ahead of the latest United States labor market report, Reuters reports. Asian markets extended their losses on Friday morning, with the Nikkei 225 closing down 2.15 percent. Chinese markets were closed for a public holiday. European stocks were also down in early trading. “Only one theme is on every trader’s mind today — the United States jobs report tonight and how that may possibly play into the Fed’s September rate decision,” said Nicholas Teo, an analyst at the online trading platform provider CMC Markets in Singapore. A strong jobs number could ease fears about a global economic slowdown, but it could make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, pledged on Thursday to increase stimulus spending if the turmoil in the global economy continues, Jack Ewing reported in The New York Times. The central bank cut its previous growth forecasts for the eurozone because of global turbulence. Mr. Draghi did note, however, that the E.C.B. would not act until it had more information about the slowdown in emerging markets and other risks. “The Governing Council wanted to emphasize its willingness to act, its readiness to act and its ability to act,” Mr. Draghi said. His remarks buoyed European stocks on Thursday, but the sentiment did not carry over into Friday. United States stock futures fell during the Asian day, pointing to a weaker opening on Wall Street after stocks ended slightly higher overnight.

A THIRD ACT FOR PHILIP FALCONE | The brash hedge fund titan who managed $26 billion before running afoul of regulators is making his second comeback attempt, Randall Smith reports in DealBook. Philip A. Falcone’s latest investment platform is a publicly traded company with $800 million in assets called HC2 Holdings. It has bought two midsize businesses — an undersea cable installer and a steel fabricator — with the intention of using the cash they generate to support several smaller growth prospects that include operations in wireless services, natural-gas truck-fueling stations, life sciences, insurance and sports. Mr. Falcone wants to hit home runs with the smaller earlier-stage ventures, as he once did by buying bonds of companies in financial distress. The venture allows him to stay active during a regulatory ban. He is barred from the securities and investment advisory businesses until 2018, but regulators have allowed him to run a public company that buys whole businesses instead of managing a fund trading stocks and bonds. Mr. Falcone has already had setbacks in his efforts to make a comeback. The results of a larger public-company vehicle he started six years ago were underwhelming. HC2’s stock has fallen by 40 percent this summer amid sales by a large investor, after quadrupling in price based on its debt-financed acquisitions. And a $195 million takeover bid that could have doubled HC2’s size was rejected recently. Mr. Falcone remains undeterred though. “I’m a competitor. I think I’m an unbelievable competitor,” he said. “As the youngest of nine kids in a three-bedroom house, I learned how not to give up.” Mr. Falcone spent a decade as a high-yield bond trader on Wall Street and then began the Harbinger Capital hedge fund in 2001, focusing on distressed debt. In 2007, he earned $1.7 billion and doubled his investors’ money on a winning bet against subprime mortgages. But in 2008, with too many illiquid positions, he faced $10 billion in redemption demands from his investors. Those demands forced him to block investor exits, even as he took a $113 million loan in 2009 to pay his own taxes while also buying out a cofounding partner for about $100 million. Although Harbinger documents gave him the right to obtain the loan, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in 2013 that he did not form a required fairness committee, did not pay the same rate as Harbinger was paying to borrow and did not disclose the loan to investors for five months. The S.E.C. inquiry, coupled with losses in 2010 and 2011, eventually doomed the hedge fund. Mr. Falcone insists he will not rush things this time. “I’m looking to build value between now and 10 years from now. It doesn’t happen overnight,” he said.

DEFENSE TO REST IN TRIAL OF EX-DEWEY & LEBOEUF EXECUTIVES | The lawyers for three former Dewey & LeBoeuf executives on trial accused of using accounting gimmicks to defraud lenders and creditors of the law firm plan to rest their case on Tuesday. They will not have called a single witness to testify in the criminal trial, which began in May, Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook. The lawyers for Steven H. Davis, the firm’s former chairman; Stephen DiCarmine, the former executive director; and Joel Sanders, the former chief financial officer told Justice Robert M. Stolz of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan that they intend to proceed directly to closing arguments. They are also expected to renew a request to dismiss the case. Prosecutors have indicated they may dismiss some of the criminal charges before the case goes to the jury. “The people haven’t proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt,” said Austin Campriello, Mr. DiCarmine’s lawyer. Elkan Abramowitz, the lawyer for Mr. Davis, said it was not always necessary for a defendant to call witnesses “if you can prove your defense through cross-examination.” But the decision is surprising given that the prosecution has called more than 40 witnesses during weeks of testimony. The strategy will bolster the defense’s argument that the prosecution’s case is based mainly on testimony from cooperating witnesses, who pleaded guilty in hopes of receiving no prison time. Dewey once employed more than 1,200 lawyers around the world and at its peak generated $1 billion in gross revenue annually. But the firm struggled during the financial crisis when merger and acquisition advisory work dried up and it was obligated to pay big salaries to several senior partners. It collapsed in bankruptcy in 2012.",Morning Agenda: Markets Slide Ahead of U.S. Jobs Report,2015-09-04,Defense to Rest Its Case in Trial of Ex-Dewey & LeBoeuf Executives | A Third Act for Philip Falcone,http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/morning-agenda-markets-slide-ahead-of-u-s-jobs-report/
1346,"CHINA JOINS THE REBOUND | Shares in China rose for the first time in a week on Thursday, following on the heels of a Wall Street rebound, Amie Tsang writes in DealBook. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped into negative territory in the last hour of trading, but shot up to close 5.3 percent higher. Trading volumes were heavy during the period — an indication of state intervention. The rest of the region rallied, with Japan and Australia finishing higher. Europe also turned positive, with the Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chips opening 2.4 percent higher. This followed markets in the United States, which soared in late trading, as DealBook’s Peter Eavis reports. Investors seemed to take heed of hints from William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that the prospect of raising interest rates next month was “less compelling.” The possibility that the cheap money that has buoyed markets might continue helped the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index close 3.9 percent higher. Mr. Dudley, a senior Federal Reserve policy maker, said a rate increase remains on the table, Binyamin Appelbaum reports in The New York Times. But this was conditional on markets regaining their balance and no disruption to the domestic economy from economic problems in other countries. It was the first public indication that Fed officials had been rattled by recent market turbulence. Mr. Dudley did say, however, that even if the Fed hesitated in September, he would hope to move later this year, at a subsequent meeting in October or December.

MARKET TUMULT ERASES ACKMAN’S GAINS | Even the most successful investors haven’t been spared by the recent market rout. William A. Ackman’s multibillion-dollar hedge fund has lost all of its gains so far this year, Alexandra Stevenson reports in The New York Times. An interim report for shareholders of his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, said it had returned to investors 10 percent net of fees for the year through the end of July. But the volatility of markets over the last few weeks had erased its double-digit returns. Its letter said that lower share prices meant many of its top holdings in companies like Mondelez and Canadian Pacific did not reflect the real value of the businesses, despite limited exposure to macroeconomic events. The firm’s top five holdings were down between 5 and 15 percent for the month of August. Other hedge funds have been rocked by the tumultuous markets too. Leon G. Cooperman’s Omega Partners was down 11 percent as of the end of last week, according to two people briefed on the matter. The world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, led by Ray Dalio, notified investors that its Pure Alpha fund was down 4.7 percent for the month. And the August performance of David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital will be closely watched. The hedge fund went into August down 9 percent for the year.

1349,"WASHINGTON — Import prices in the United States fell only slightly in September, offset by recovering oil prices and suggesting a slowdown in the rate of imported deflation.

American import prices declined only 0.1 percent last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday, and import prices, excluding oil, fell 0.2 percent, which was half the pace of the declines in July and August.

Analysts expected overall import prices to decline more.

“Today’s report suggests a significant slowing in the rate of imported deflation,” said Blerina Uruçi, an analyst at Barclays.

In September, the Federal Reserve held off from raising interest rates largely because a weak global economy and financial market volatility had raised doubts that inflation in the United States would rise toward the Fed’s target of 2 percent as expected. A slowdown in the rate of imported deflation may help free the central bank to raise rates.

A surge in the value of the United States dollar last year, propelled by expectations that a strengthening American economy would lead to higher interest rates, has been a factor pushing down inflation, as shown by declines in nonoil import prices.

The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, who said late last month that the Fed was likely to raise rates by the end of the year, has argued that the disinflationary impact of imports was bound to fade and that United States inflation would then tend to rise. The data on Friday appeared to confirm that.

Already, declines in oil prices have moderated after a late 2014 plunge, and prices for imported oil rose 1.1 percent in September after declining sharply in August.

Crude oil prices have actually moved higher over the last month. The dollar, which strengthened sharply in the second half of 2014, has weakened since March.

The Labor Department data also showed that the price of imported consumer goods other than cars actually rose 0.1 percent in September, the first gain since February. Imported car prices were flat.

Still, the data also pointed to continuing weakness in global demand that is weighing heavily on American factories and other exporters.

1358,"WASHINGTON — A day after a report showed a surge in retail sales last month, a survey affirmed that American consumers were growing more comfortable, on expectations that a tightening labor market would spur big wage raises.

The rise in sentiment came despite higher gasoline prices, which contributed to producer prices recording their biggest increase in more than two and a half years in May. Over all, it capped off a week of strong economic data and was the latest indication that growth was regaining momentum after a sluggish start to the second quarter.

Strong consumer confidence, together with the tightening labor market, the bullish retail sales and the firming inflation pressures may provide the Federal Reserve reassurance about the U.S. economic outlook amid expectations it will raise interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank’s policy-setting committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.

“While more progress needs to be seen before the Fed feels sufficiently confident in the sustainability of the recovery, they will certainly take comfort in the fact that things are beginning to move in the right direction,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.

The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose to 94.6 in early June from 90.7 in May. Consumers were the most favorable about their personal financial prospects since 2007, with households expecting the largest wage gains since 2008. Consumers also expected inflation to remain low over the foreseeable future.

“We could get more good news on the spending front in the coming months,” said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York.

U.S. financial markets were little moved by Friday’s data as traders seemed to be more focused on the latest twists in Greece’s debt crisis.

In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.5 percent last month, the largest gain since September 2012. It followed a 0.4 percent decline in April. The data suggested an oil-driven downward drift in prices was nearing an end.

Producer Prices Index of finished goods prices and services, 1982=100, seasonally adjusted. MARCH +0.2% APRIL –0.4% MAY +0.5% 112 111 110 108 ’14 ’15

The stabilization in inflation, together with tightening labor market could see inflation rise back toward the Fed’s 2 percent target.

“Inflation pressures have a heartbeat and should rise further over the next year as the economy is at or very near full employment levels,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

In the year to May, the price index fell 1.1 percent, marking the fourth straight 12-month decrease. Prices dropped 1.3 percent in the 12 months through April, the biggest fall since 2010.

Last month, gasoline prices surged 17 percent, the largest increase since August 2009. Food prices rose 0.8 percent in May, the biggest gain in just over a year, snapping five straight months of declines.

Higher food prices were driven by a shortage of eggs after an outbreak of bird flu led to the culling of millions of chickens. Wholesale egg prices soared a record 56.4 percent last month.

Higher gasoline and food prices are likely to feed into the May consumer price index. May consumer price data will be published next week.

The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, increased 0.6 percent in May after falling 0.8 percent in the prior month.

Starbucks isn’t the place to go for cheap coffee. It is selling an experience, not a commodity.

That approach has been immensely successful, drawing in millions of customers and propelling Starbucks stock to stellar returns. But the company’s strategy has created an odd situation this summer: It has raised retail prices for much of the coffee brewed in its stores just as coffee prices on world commodities markets have fallen.

Consider that once, long ago, coffeehouses were the trading centers of world financial markets. If you wanted to know the price of any commodity, you could find it while sipping coffee in London. But this year, if your only information about commodity prices came from coffee sold at Starbucks stores, you might have to conclude that a bull market was underway.

The opposite is true, however. Coffee has been caught in a commodities downdraft that intensified briefly last week as China, a big commodities consumer, devalued its currency. The currencies of commodity producers like Malaysia, Indonesia, Russia, Colombia and Brazil have fallen for months now, along with oil, iron and steel. Coffee has taken one of the deepest dives.

Yet on July 6, Starbucks said that its costs were rising and that it was raising the price of much of its brewed coffee by 5 to 20 cents a cup.

At the Midtown Manhattan store I frequent, a “venti” cup — 20 ounces of joe — rose 10 cents to $2.55 before tax, while a “tall” 12-ounce cup stayed at $1.95. Tall cups rose in price in many other places, said Jim Olson, a spokesman. Prices for food remain unchanged. Over all, Starbucks said customer bills would increase 1 percent.

In a statement, Lisa Passe, a spokeswoman, said Starbucks tried to “balance the need to run our business profitably while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers.”

It may be succeeding, though as a customer who happens to follow financial markets closely, I was startled by an apparent disconnect between world events and Starbucks decision-making. Why should I be paying more at Starbucks when coffee has been getting cheaper?

The price changes in the global coffee market have been breathtaking. The futures price for standard Arabica, the benchmark for premium coffee, peaked in October and fell 44 percent in world markets by July 6, the day of the Starbucks announcement. Some companies responded by lowering prices. J. M. Smucker announced in late June that it was cutting supermarket prices of its Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts brands by an average of 6 percent. Starbucks left its packaged coffee unchanged, but decided to extract more revenue in its stores.

The company’s ability to raise prices has delighted the stock market. Starbucks shares have returned 5.4 percent since July 6, compared with a 1.3 percent return for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. The company has outperformed over longer periods, too. Its shares returned 51 percent, including dividends, over the last year, compared with 9 percent for the index; over five years, the return was 412 percent for Starbucks versus 115 percent for the index.

Starbucks has been growing rapidly and profitably, expanding while calibrating revenues and expenses. In a conference call with investors on July 23, Starbucks executives disclosed that they had already locked in the price for more than 80 percent of coffee supplies for 2016.

Hamish Smith, a commodities economist with Capital Economics in London, said in an interview that a company like Starbucks “can’t afford to be in a position where it will run out of coffee or will suddenly have to pay an unexpectedly high price for it.”

Starbucks’s financial statements indicate that the company tries to insulate itself from exposure to currency and commodity fluctuations through hedging and advance purchase agreements. Operating costs dropped in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 28 because of lower commodity costs, mainly for coffee, the annual report said.

But when coffee prices drop unexpectedly, as they did this year, these advance strategies can have some negative short-term consequences: It’s likely that Starbucks paid more than the current spot market price for coffee stocks, which would be reflected in future financial statements.

That’s one reason Starbucks is on a different timetable than the broad market.

Another is that coffee accounts for less than 10 percent of Starbucks’s overall costs, Mr. Olson said. The premium Starbucks experience requires considerable spending on real estate and wages, and on extensive employee benefits, equipment, distribution and marketing, he said.

And there may be another factor. Howard Schultz, Starbucks’s chief executive, told investors during the conference call last month that “mobile payments now represent 20 percent of all in-store transactions in our U.S. stores, more than double the figure from only two years ago.” I use an iPhone app to pay these days: It’s easy to transfer money without noticing the cost.

Starbucks assumes that customers will consider the new prices to be reasonable, and maybe they are, if you considered past prices reasonable. In 1994, when Starbucks opened its Manhattan stores, it charged $1.25 for a small cup — then only eight ounces, known as a “short.” In inflation-adjusted dollars, that would be $2.01 today, yet a short cup in Manhattan costs only $1.85. You have to ask for one specifically, though; a short is no longer listed on store menus. Still, if you are careful, you can spend less in real money than you did in 1994, even after the latest price adjustments.

Meanwhile, Starbucks is churning out profits. Even if its prices aren’t in sync with commodities markets, the stock market appreciates its timing.",Why Starbucks Prices Went Up as Coffee Beans Got Cheaper,2015-08-16,The company’s strategy has created an odd situation this summer: It has increased retail prices for brewed coffee just as coffee prices on world commodities markets have fallen.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/your-money/why-starbucks-prices-went-up-as-coffee-beans-got-cheaper.html

As with most of my beauty gripes, I blame age for the latest affront — hair as parched as a California farm. “As we age, the amount of oil we produce decreases in the skin and hair,” Kenneth Beer, a dermatologist in West Palm Beach, Fla., confirmed. “This makes the hair shaft more brittle.” Tack on visits to the saltwater pool at the McCarren Hotel in my neighborhood, and my hair was thirstier than a hangover. But hunting for hair masks proved bewildering. Some were so heavy I could have substituted mayonnaise for the same drizzled-oil effect. Others were so subtle that any daily conditioner would have done the job at half the price. But a select few impressed. Below, three deep-conditioning options that admirably tame and hydrate without weighing down strands.

Klorane Mask With Desert Date ($24)

At once hydrating and lightweight, this mask is an excellent weekly treatment. An extra five to 10 minutes in the shower does the trick. It also happens to smell delicious.

Phyto Phytoplage Sublime After Sun Hair & Body Oil ($40)

This multipurpose oil, which contains squalane, camellia seed oil and egg yolk extract, goes on before shampooing. You rub it into dry hair about 10 minutes before heading into the shower. Its moisturizing power is superior to many conventional masks — and it can fit into other parts of your beauty routine. At a recent sunset cocktail party, I swiped the oil along my collarbone and shins. Presto! An enviable J.Lo glow.

ReGenesis Detox Hair and Scalp Masque ($42)

After losing hair by the handful post-pregnancy, I became a fanatic about hair-growth products. This minty mask from the makers of RevitaLash doesn’t promise actual growth, but it has noticeably improved the health of my hair. Skeptical at first about the detoxifying silt-based formula (would it sop up all my natural oils?), I am now a convert. Unlike most masks, the formula sits on your scalp, but post-rinse it manages to increase volume.

1399,"While Japan’s core consumer prices rose for the first time in five months in November, household spending tumbled, casting doubt on the central bank’s view that robust consumption will help accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target. The mixed batch of data will keep alive expectations that the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, who has said he will do whatever it takes to achieve his ambitious price goal, may nudge the central bank into expanding stimulus as early as next month. “The downward pressure from falling oil prices seems to have run its course, which helped core C.P.I. rise,” said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at the Mizuho Research Institute, referring to the core consumer price index. “But consumer prices likely won’t rise as fast as the B.O.J. projects. We expect the central bank to ease next year.” The core C.P.I., which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.1 percent in November from a year earlier, data showed on Friday.

It’s hard to escape the sense that something similar is happening now when it comes to estimates of the NAIRU, the lowest level unemployment can reach before inflation becomes an issue. The chart shows the actual unemployment rate versus the FOMC estimate of the long-run unemployment rate (the middle of the “central tendency” until the latest report, which gives us the median). Estimates of how low U can go seem always to be a bit below the current level of unemployment.

Stocks spent most of the morning little changed, but moved steadily higher after investors had a chance to work through the minutes from the Fed’s September policy meeting.

In the minutes, Fed officials expressed confidence that the U.S. economy was improving, citing the improving job market. But policy makers had concerns that inflation continues to remain abnormally low, noting the recent drop in commodity prices, which were a major reason why the Fed did not raise interest rates.

The Fed has kept interest rates near zero for nearly seven years now. The Fed has repeatedly signaled it wants to raise interest rates, but it has held off on doing so.

“The Federal Reserve is waiting for the ideal time to raise rates. But, for those who live in the real world, we know that there is not a ‘perfect’ time to raise interest rates,” said David Libovitz, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.

Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman’s wealth management business, said investors no longer expect rates to go up this year, even though the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has said that’s likely to happen. He added that the central bank is “beginning to falter” in communicating to investors what its plans are.

“The market has begun to conclude that they’re the boy who cried wolf” where raising interest rates are concerned, Mr. Clemons said.

The price of oil rose Thursday as the dollar weakened, making oil more attractive to overseas buyers, and on concerns that Russia’s military actions in Syria raised the threat of a wider conflict in the region.

Energy stocks were among the biggest gainers on Thursday, following oil higher. Marathon Oil rose 5 percent, Occidental Petroleum was up 3 percent, and Hess added 4 percent.

Benchmark U.S. oil rose $1.62, or 3.4 percent, at $49.43 a barrel in New York. Brent Crude, which is used to price international oils, gained $1.72, or 3.4 percent, to $53.05 a barrel in London.

In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 1.8 cents to close at $1.408 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2.2 cents to close at $1.602 a gallon and natural gas rose 2.4 cents to close at $2.498 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The market made only small moves as the Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting to discuss interest rates, marking a pause after a rally this month that has wiped out much of a steep loss from August.

Investors, still concerned about the slow pace of the economic recovery in the United States, were wondering how the economy and the market will react when interest rates eventually start to rise.

Few now expect the Fed to raise interest rates this year. But while very low rates tend to be favorable for stocks and bonds, many investors would like to see the uncertainty over interest rate policy resolved.

“We don’t think there’s going to be enough evidence between now and the end of the year to support a move by the Fed,” said Patrick Maldari, a senior fixed income investment specialist at Aberdeen Asset Management. “They just have not had the ammunition. The economic data continues to be weak.”

1440,"Yet the real story goes beyond numbers, revealed in the absurdities of life in a country where the government has refused for months to release basic economic data like the inflation rate or the gross domestic product.

Even as the country’s income has shrunk with the collapsing price of oil — Venezuela’s only significant export — and the black market for dollars has soared, the government has insisted on keeping the country’s principal exchange rate frozen at 6.3 bolívars to the dollar.

That astonishing disparity makes for a sticker-shock economy in which it can be hard to be sure what anything is really worth, and in which the black-market dollar increasingly dictates prices.

A movie ticket costs about 380 bolívars. Calculated at the government rate, that is $60. At the black-market rate, it is just 54 cents. Want a large popcorn and soda with that? Depending on how you calculate it, that is either $1.15 or $128.

The minimum wage is 7,421 bolívars a month. That is either a decent $1,178 a month or a miserable $10.60.

Either way, it does not go far enough. According to the Center for Documentation and Social Analysis of the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers, a month’s worth of food for a family of five cost 50,625 bolívars in August, more than six times the minimum monthly wage and more than three times what it cost in the same month a year earlier.

Dinner for two at one of this city’s better restaurants can cost 30,000 bolívars. That is $42.85 at the black-market rate or $4,762 at the official exchange rate.

Inflation has gotten so bad that auto insurance companies have threatened to issue policies that expire after six months, to minimize the risk from the soaring cost of car parts.

A gallon of white paint cost almost 6,000 bolívars on a recent Tuesday. At the same store on the following Friday, it cost more than 12,000 bolívars.

With crucial legislative elections scheduled in December, the government has begun to make refrigerators, air-conditioners and household appliances available to government workers and the party faithful at rock-bottom prices. One government worker said he had bought a Chinese-made 48-inch plasma television for 11,000 bolívars, or just $15.71 at the black-market exchange rate.

Mr. Maduro blames an “economic war” waged by his enemies, foreign and domestic, for the problems. But most economists say the problems are caused by the fall in oil prices and the government’s policies, including strict controls on prices and foreign exchange for imports.

As the crisis has unfolded, Mr. Maduro has hesitated to make changes even top officials say are needed, like raising the price of gasoline, which is so heavily subsidized that it is virtually free — perhaps because he is fearful of a backlash before the elections.

Things get stranger by the day.

Need a new car battery? Bring a pillow, because you will have to sleep overnight in your car outside the shop. On a recent night, more than 80 cars were lined up.

Want a new career? Plenty of Venezuelans have quit their jobs to sell basic goods like disposable diapers or corn flour on the black market, tripling or quadrupling their salary in the process.

Need cash? O.K., but not too much. Some A.T.M.s limit withdrawals to the black-market equivalent of about 50 cents.

Given the chronic shortages of basic goods, supermarkets and pharmacies fill long rows of shelves with a single product. One store recently had both sides of an aisle lined with packages of salt. Another did the same thing with vinegar. A pharmacy had row after row of cotton swabs.

But among all the shortages here, one of the most notable is a shortage of paper money, especially the coffee-colored 100-bolívar notes that are the largest in general circulation (black-market value, about 14 cents) and feature a portrait of Simón Bolívar.

“You want to understand why there’s a lot of money and there’s no money?” Ruth de Krivoy, a former Central Bank president, asked with a rueful laugh. She said the main problem was that the government had failed to respond to rapidly rising prices by issuing larger-denomination bills, like a 1,000- or 10,000-bolívar note. So people need many more bills to buy the same goods they bought a year ago.

Also, as people resort to the black market to buy more goods that cannot be found in stores, transactions that could once be made with debit or credit cards are now conducted with cash. That creates logistical problems, as banks must move around huge amounts of paper money and A.T.M.s empty out more quickly.

Mr. Maduro is certainly aware of the symbolic impact of issuing larger bills with more zeros — and the inevitable comparison it would strike with his predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez. In 2008, Mr. Chávez issued new bills and knocked off three zeros from a currency that had long suffered from devaluation and inflation, renaming it the strong bolívar.

Today, the bolívar is anything but strong.

The other day, Jaime Bello, an airline mechanic, visited his bank, the government-run Banco del Tesoro, only to find that its three cash machines were out of money. He recalled an earlier visit when he went to withdraw 2,000 bolívars and stood listening to the whirring sound as the machine spit out a great stack of 5-bolívar notes, each worth less than an American penny. He pulled out the stack of 200 bills and then waited while the machine counted out 200 more.

“It’s crazy,” he said. “We’re living a nightmare. There’s nothing to buy, and the money isn’t worth anything.”

The crisis has also meant opportunity for those willing to stand in long lines to buy cheap government-regulated goods that they can resell at a profit.

“I said to myself, ‘I can make more doing this,’ and I quit my job at the hair salon,” said Geraldine Cassiani, who left her job as a manicurist in February for a career on the black market. She said she now earned four to five times what she had before.

On a recent trip to the supermarket, she used contacts at the store to skip the line outside and bought four packages of disposable diapers, even though shoppers were limited to two each. Ms. Cassiani already had a “client” lined up to buy the diapers for almost three times what she paid: a nurse who could not take time off to stand in line.

Mr. Maduro regularly goes on television to denounce black marketeers and to blame them for shortages and high prices.

“Partly, I think that what I’m doing is bad,” Ms. Cassiani said, adding that she raised prices less than some black marketeers. A single mother, she said she had to provide for her child.

“Necessity has a dog’s face,” she said.","Few in Venezuela Want Bolívars, but No One Can Spare a Dime",2015-10-19,"The country&#8217;s currency has crashed along with its economy, despite an unchanging official exchange rate, transforming economic absurdities into daily hardships.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/world/americas/few-in-venezuela-want-bolivars-but-no-one-can-spare-a-dime.html

1453,"For the first time since the onset of the 2008 financial crisis — and the Federal Reserve’s response, which was to drive down the cost of money to near zero — some rational pricing seems finally to be seeping into the market for the riskiest debt securities. This correction in the price of bonds is good news for investors, for markets generally and for the rest of us who hope not to suffer another deleterious credit collapse fueled by fee-seeking underwriters and speculators on Wall Street.

A little background: It turned out that the combination of the Fed’s recent policies of quantitative easing — an extensive $4 trillion effort to drive down long-term interest rates by bidding up the price of high-yielding debt securities — and its policy of keeping short-term interest rates as close to zero as possible for as long as possible have together been highly effective at keeping rates at low levels.

The Fed’s not-incorrect logic was that in the face of congressional unwillingness to enact a robust fiscal stimulus program, its robust monetary policy would kick-start an economy moribund after the shocking events of 2008 by making borrowed money cheap.

Of course, there was collateral damage. The Fed’s extraordinary intervention drove up the prices of many debt securities and lowered their yields, since the price of bonds trade in inverse proportion to their yields. As a result, for years investors have been engaged in the yield hunger games, scouring the world for higher returns on fixed-income securities than could be otherwise found in the safer confines of, say, the market for United States Treasury securities, where the yield on the 10-year bond is now around 2 percent.

The investor frenzy to find higher yields had the consequence of driving up the price of high-yield bonds — among the riskiest debt securities around — and pushing down their yields to around 5 percent, which is what, in normal markets, an investor might expect to receive from bonds offered by top corporate issuers like General Electric or Johnson & Johnson. For years, risk has been mispriced as investors bid up the high-yielding debt securities in an effort to find something that paid them a decent return. But, of course, that’s a fool’s game, because eventually reality sets in.

And now it has. For the first time since 2012, the collective yield on junk bonds rose in early October to above 8 percent, an increase of nearly 300 basis points since May 2013, according to an index of domestic high-yield bonds published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For investors who bought bonds at par in May 2013, the collapse in prices that corresponded with the higher yield means they have suffered some serious losses on their bonds. (Of course, they should have anticipated that when they bought them in the first place at such dizzying prices.)

Bonds issued by companies in the independent energy sector, the metals and mining sector and oil field services sector have been the hardest hit as commodity prices have fallen. But bonds in other industries are also likely to fall in price, too. Standard & Poor’s, the credit ratings agency, has downgraded the debt of more companies so far this year than in the last two years combined; in the third quarter alone it lowered ratings on some $211 billion of debt. According to Moody’s, a rival to S.&P., some $50 billion of bonds and bank debt have defaulted so far in 2015. Moody’s has compiled a list of another 44 companies it thinks might soon also default on their debt.

I asked Christina Padgett, a senior vice president at Moody’s focused on leveraged finance, why the bond market had suddenly come to its senses after years of insanity. She started working in the high-yield debt market in 1998. She conceded she was not exactly sure. “It is a confluence of factors,” she said, “and not necessarily the same for the loan and bond markets.” But she cited a few reasons: Increased volatility is “not good” generally for the leverage finance market, nor was the late summer “downdraft” in the equity markets. (The recovery in stocks in the last few weeks has also led to a bit of a recovery in the high-yield market.)

Ms. Padgett also noted that a large portion of the high-yield market was composed of issuers in the energy sector, which has come under severe economic pressure as commodity prices have collapsed. She said she understood why investors in recent years had reached for yield. “There’s very little yield in the world today and still lots of liquidity,” she said. But she is still surprised at how badly risk has been mispriced.

“There was no such thing as single-digit yields for single B’s,” when she started in the business, she said, referring to junk bonds with a B rating. Nevertheless, she told me, credit sensitivity seemed to be increasing as evidence mounted that the market was on the other side of the credit cycle. She added that the largest impact was probably a decline in opportunistic deals and dividends and the more aggressive leveraged buyouts.

This is all good news. The time is long overdue for the insanity in the credit markets to come to an end. Investors need to be adequately compensated for the risks they are taking when they buy debt of tenuous credit quality. That’s the only way to make sure the credit markets operate smoothly.

It’s healthy to see that investors are starting to wise up after seven years of a Fed-induced high. A big test of the newfangled investor sentiment looms: In the coming weeks, Dell, which is rated BB by S.&P. after of its leveraged buyout in 2013, will issue some $15 billion of high-yield debt to finance its audacious $63 billion takeover of EMC Corporation.

The current thinking is that the pricing on that debt will be a yield of 6 to 8 percent, significantly above the 5.8 percent yield for BB-rated credits as a group. Dell “will have to come with some fairly accommodative terms,” Henry Peabody, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance, told The Financial Times last week. “They will have to entice investors to buy it given the size and some concern over leverage.” Not a moment too soon.",Sensible Pricing Comes to High-Risk Debt Securities,2015-10-29,The time is long overdue for investors to get adequately compensated for buying the debt of companies whose credit quality is tenuous.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/business/dealbook/sensible-pricing-comes-to-high-risk-debt-securities.html

1458,"Stocks closed modestly lower Friday as oil titans Exxon Mobil and Chevron led a slump in energy stocks.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 56.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,689.86. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 4.71 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,103.92. The Nasdaq closed little changed, down half a point to 5,128.28.

It was a see-saw week for the market, but all three major indexes closed higher by roughly 1 percent.

Shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest publicly traded energy companies, fell roughly 5 percent each on Friday. Both companies posted major declines in their year-over-year profits largely due to the big drop in the price of oil.

All the big oil companies are cutting back. Exxon said Friday it cut spending by $1.54 billion in the second quarter, while Chevron announced it is laying off 1,500 workers. Until about six months ago, booming U.S. oil and gas production was helping the country’s economy grow during a time of economic sluggishness.

David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said this week that a $29 billion decline in oil exploration and mining activity in the U.S. cut economic growth by 0.7 percent in the second quarter, a sizable chunk for an economy that grew 2.3 percent.

Investors also feel the pain. Lower oil profits have an outsize effect on the stock market because the companies are so enormous. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote that when oil prices drop by 10 percent, earnings for the overall S.&P. 500 fall by 1 percent.

In the case of Exxon, earnings fell 52 percent from a year earlier, causing the company to report its lowest quarterly profit since June 2009. Exxon shares fell $3.80, or 4.6 percent, to $79.21.

Chevron, hurt by low oil prices and a write-off of some of its assets, reported its lowest profit in 13 years. The company reported a profit of 30 cents a share, well below the $1.13 analysts expected. Chevron fell $4.55, or 4.9 percent, to $88.48.

Exxon and Chevron dragged down other energy stocks on Friday. The S.&P. 500 energy sector slumped 2.6 percent, its biggest drop since January.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday 17,780 Previous close 17,745.98 17,740 17,700 17,660 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

Over all, energy companies have been a major drag on corporate earnings in the second quarter. S.&P. 500 companies are on track for a 1.3 percent year-over-year decline in earnings, according to FactSet. If energy were excluded, corporate profits would be up 5.4 percent.

And the price of crude has continued to fall. Oil prices declined sharply again Friday on continuing concerns over high global supplies and weak demand, helping push oil down 21 percent for the month.

Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.40 to close at $47.12 a barrel in New York. Crude fell $12.35 a barrel during the month, from $59.47 at the end of June. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell $1.10 to close at $52.21 in London.

A disappointing economic report also weighed on stocks.

U.S. wages and benefits grew at their slowest pace in 33 years in the spring, the Labor Department said, stark evidence that the improving job market is having little impact on paychecks for most Americans. The slowdown likely reflects a sharp drop-off in bonus and incentive pay for some workers.

The employment cost index rose just 0.2 percent in the April-June quarter after a 0.7 increase in the first quarter, the Labor Department said. Wages and salaries alone also rose 0.2 percent. Both measures recorded the smallest quarterly gains since the second quarter of 1982.

The lackluster figures come after the index had been pointing to a pickup in wage growth after nearly two years of steady hiring. The index rose just 2 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. That is down from a 2.6 percent increase in the first quarter, which was the biggest in six and a half years.

The slowdown suggests that companies are still able to find the workers they need without boosting pay, a sign the job market is not yet back to full health. That could cause some Federal Reserve officials to push for a delay in any increase in the short-term interest rate they control.

“Despite a tighter labor market, and all of the stories about pay increases at various large firms, wage growth is not picking up meaningfully,” said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets. “This may not sit well with policymakers.”

Bond prices rose after the wage report, pushing the 10-year U.S. Treasury note down to 2.19 percent from 2.26 percent on Thursday.

In other energy markets, wholesale gasoline rose 1.3 cents to close at $1.841 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1.4 cents to close at $1.584 a gallon. Natural gas fell 5.2 cents to close at $2.716 per 1,000 cubic feet.

In currencies, the dollar fell 0.3 percent to 123.90 yen and the euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.0985.

1462,"Stocks posted moderate gains in a quiet trading day on Monday, recovering part of their losses sustained late last week.

Energy stocks continued to be a drag on the market, as the price of oil fell once again.

The Dow Jones industrial average added 123.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,251.62. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 15.60 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,021.15, and the Nasdaq composite rose 45.84 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,968.92.

Investors are still assessing the effects of the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Markets rose last Wednesday after the Fed made its decision, but then fell sharply later in the week as traders sold shares to book profits. The Dow dropped 2.1 percent on Friday.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Monday. 17,280 17,240 17,200 17,160 Previous close 17,128.55 17,120 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

The buying on Monday was partly a recovery from last week’s drop, a common response to a sell-off.

Crude oil dropped again, however, nearing levels not seen since the financial crisis. Crude oil fell 25 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $35.81 a barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, was down 53 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $36.35 a barrel.

Energy stocks struggled as a result, making it the worst-performing sector in the S.&P. 500.

Shares of Newfield Exploration fell $1.19, or nearly 4 percent, to $30.41. ConocoPhillips shares fell 83 cents, or about 2 percent, to $45.10.

Nobody has to tell Juliana Spahr that the personal is political: She has spent her career inventing verse and prose forms that show how our intimate feelings emerge, like knots in nets or waves at sea, from systems much larger than any one person’s control. “This Connection of Everyone With Lungs” (2005) ­examined the global effects of 9/11 through the metaphor of polluted air; the piled-up details in “Well Then There Now” (2011) looked at Spahr’s years in Hawaii, and at her ­origins in Appalachia, as if to ask where she could call home.

Now Spahr lives in the San Francisco Bay Area; she joined the encampments and protests of Occupy Oakland in 2011, though she and her young son “never spent the night.” “That Winter the Wolf Came” is Spahr’s Occupy book: Its nine thoughtful, wiry works (three in prose, six in verse) ask how it felt and what it means to remain a disillusioned opponent of capitalism, a not-quite-despondent environmental observer and an anxious parent today.

It’s hard to quote Spahr in ways that show how good she is, because, phrase by phrase, she keeps her writing austere. It depends on successive overlaps, on slow builds, so that over several pages we discover (for example) what the BP oil spill, the dispersal of Occupy by the police, the price of Brent crude, the flights of brent geese and the repetitions in pop songs have in common: They let singers “during the ongoing oil wars” — or birds displaced from flight paths, or protesters swept from a park — “understand something about what is being lost.”

Land and sea, oil and water, corporations and human beings: For Spahr these things can no longer be considered separately. Spahr and her child, and you and I, are already caught up in the dangerous skein of financial instruments and hydrological disequilibrium. “I hold out my hand./ I hand over / and I pass on. . . . I hold out my hand and take engine oil additive into me and then I pass on this engine oil additive to this other thing that once was me, this not really me.” That’s Spahr’s disconcerting description of breast-feeding in our era of BPA and chlorinated naphthalenes. Other connections cross national borders, link species and generate hope: “The red snapper spreads itself out in the artificial reefs of oil platforms,” thriving in the dangerous new place. To save the climate and the oceans, activists (Spahr implies) must become as international as the fish, the tankers and the contaminants, “traveling through the circuits that already exist.”

Like Claudia Rankine’s celebrated “Citizen,” Spahr’s book is a set of ­interlocking parts, some lyrical, some starkly factual, best read whole. Like “Citizen,” it can leave you somber, or angrily alert, or simply impressed. Her “poem about oil extraction in iambic pentameter” tells the story of the Deepwater Horizon spill blow by blow: “It is almost at ten / O’clock when mud begins its overflow- / Ing of the line and then on the rig floor.” Facing the excessive power of oil, Spahr’s poetic “line” itself breaks up, gives way.

Yet Spahr sees a future for her radical cause. One essay remembers the ­movement, which she names ­“Non-Revolution,” as if it were a lover, with “this odd patch of hair on its lower back”: “I wanted to be with ­Non-Revolution and everyone Non-Revolution was with.” Her last poem, “Turnt” (as in “turned up”: excited or intoxicated), recreates a violent night when she and her friends were “turnt to mere vandals at moments.” At others, they saw — and she can make us see — a new world: “We were together but we were in it alone at the same time. Except the state was there with us. . . . We knew history. We knew we would not be together long.”","‘That Winter the Wolf Came,’ by Juliana Spahr",2015-08-30,"Poems take on the political, from oil spills to Occupy Oakland.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/books/review/that-winter-the-wolf-came-by-juliana-spahr.html

1500,"The stock market slumped to its second-biggest weekly loss of the year on Friday, breaking six consecutive weeks of gains. Fears that the holiday shopping season will be weak drove down retail stocks.

Retailers as varied as department stores and dollar stores plunged after Nordstrom posted disappointing third-quarter results, just as Macy’s had done earlier this week.

The price of oil fell further on evidence that global supplies are still rising. The dollar could grow stronger still, further pressuring oil and other commodities and affecting mining and energy companies.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 202.83 points, or 1.2 percent, to 17,245.24. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 22.93 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,023.04. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 77.20 points, or 1.5 percent, to 4,927.88.

Concerns about retail sales and skidding commodities prices have eroded the gains from October’s big stock market rally. Stocks have now lost ground seven of the last eight days. Over all, the S.&P. 500 is down almost 2 percent for the year.

Nordstrom’s shares sank $9.51, or 15 percent, to $53.96 after reporting weaker sales. The company also cut its forecast for the year. Macy’s did the same on Wednesday.

Holiday shopping will unofficially begin on Black Friday in two weeks, and investors are becoming worried that the latest reports are signaling that sales will be weak during the season, which is a crucial moneymaker for retailers. Macy’s and Nordstrom each hit two-year lows on Friday. Consumer discretionary stocks were by far the worst performing group in the S.&P. 500.

J. C. Penney’s results were about equal to analyst projections, but its stock lost $1.35, or 15.4 percent, to $7.44. The video game retailer GameStop sank $7.35, or 16.5 percent, to $37.18. The watchmaker Fossil Group plunged $18.62, or 36.5 percent, to $32.39. Fossil posted disappointing earnings on Thursday afternoon and also said it would buy the activity tracker maker Misfit for $260 million. Its shares hit their lowest level in five years.

Compounding those worries was a government report showing that United States retail spending rose just 0.1 percent in October, a bit less than analysts had expected. Prices charged by farmers, manufacturers and other producers fell in October. The figures show there is little sign of inflation in the United States economy. When inflation is higher, consumers have an incentive to spend more money.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 17,480 17,420 Previous close 17,448.07 17,360 17,300 17,240 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

Richard Jaffe, a Stifel Nicolaus analyst, suggested the widespread selling was an overreaction. Shoppers will spend plenty of money this holiday season, he said, and while they’re spending more money on smartphones and TVs and other big items than they used to, there will still be plenty of socks and sweaters given as gifts, too.

“Christmas is boxed gifts,” Mr. Jaffe said. “There will be a lot of gift giving, a lot of apparel sales.”

He noted that American shopping habits had changed a lot over the last few years. Consumers are spending more on homes, cars and vacations. Aging baby boomers don’t buy clothes as often as they used to, and younger shoppers are more interested in technology.

The price of oil fell again after the International Energy Agency said commercial inventories reached almost three billion barrels at the end of September, a record.

The agency also said growth in global demand would slow next year. Oil prices have dropped because demand cannot keep up with ever-increasing supplies. The strong dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities costlier to buyers using yen, euro and other currencies.

United States crude oil slumped $1.02, or 2.4 percent, to $40.73 a barrel in New York. It has dropped about 13 percent this month and is at its lowest price since late August. Brent crude lost 45 cents, or 1 percent, to $43.61 a barrel in London.

Jim Ritterbusch of the oil trading firm Ritterbusch & Associates said crude could fall an additional $3 to $4 a barrel. It has gone as low as $37.75 this year.

In other energy trading, heating oil fell 2.5 cents to $1.381 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline dipped 3.4 cents to $1.239 a gallon. Natural gas rose 10.1 cents to $2.361 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The price of gold fell 10 cents to $1,080.90 an ounce. Silver fell for the 10th day in a row, losing 2.1 cents to $14.20 an ounce. Copper dipped slightly to just under $2.17 a pound. All three metals are at their lowest levels in six years.

The generic drug maker Mylan climbed after a long pursuit of the Irish drug maker Perrigo came to an end. Perrigo’s shareholders rejected a $26 billion offer from Mylan, an offer Perrigo had called inadequate. Mylan logged the biggest gain on the S.&P. 500, adding $5.58, or 12.9 percent, to $48.78. Perrigo fell $9.65, or 6.2 percent, to $146.90.

1520,"A burst of hiring last month led to a drop in the bond market Friday as traders placed bets that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates later this year.

Despite the good economic news, the stock market drifted to another loss, finishing lower for the second week in a row.

The Labor Department reported that United States employers added 280,000 workers to their payrolls in May and also raised its estimate of the number of people hired in March and April by a combined 32,000.

Traders reacted immediately to the report, dropping United States government bonds and shooting their yields up. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note bounced to a high for the year, 2.43 percent, before drifting back to 2.41 percent. The dollar gained strength against the Japanese yen and other major currencies.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” said Russell Price, Ameriprise Financial’s senior economist. “This adds to the recent spate of positive data that shows the economy is really pulling out of its winter slump.”

Still, the major stock indexes finished mixed.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 56.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,849.46. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 3.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,092.83, while the Nasdaq edged up 9.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,068.46.

Big banks and other companies that benefit from rising interest rates made gains: JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services reached new closing highs.

Jeremy Zirin, head of investment strategy at UBS Wealth Management, said the rapid rise in interest rates over recent months had unsettled some investors. In April, when traders were more concerned about the strength of the global economy, the yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped below 1.9 percent.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 17,940 Previous close 17,905.58 17,900 17,860 17,820 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

In general, a rise in interest rates reflects economic growth, but a quick leap could slow the economy down by causing a sudden drop in lending.

Mr. Zirin said investors “want to see the rise in bond yields be more tempered. They can handle higher interest rates as long as they come at a measured pace.”

In Europe, markets were rattled by Greece’s decision to bundle together its coming payments to the International Monetary Fund.

The move heightened concerns that the country would default on its debts and drop the euro. At an emergency session of Greece’s parliament on Friday, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said his government cannot accept “irrational” proposals.

Greece’s stock market led the way lower. The benchmark Athens index slumped 5 percent. Elsewhere, both France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX ended with a loss of 1.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 sank 0.8 percent.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 finished with a drop of 0.1 percent, and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.2 percent. In China, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.1 percent, and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.5 percent.

Precious and industrial metals futures settled mostly lower. Gold lost $7.10 to $1,167.80 an ounce, and silver slipped 12 cents to $15.98 an ounce. Copper picked up a penny to close at $2.69 a pound.

1526,"Stocks overcame an early stumble Tuesday and finished modestly higher as investors shook off concerns about heightened tensions in the Middle East and a drop in consumer confidence.

The price of oil spiked after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane that Turkey said had violated its airspace and ignored warnings. Energy stocks moved higher along with the price of oil. Travel-related stocks slumped.

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 19.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,812.19. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 2.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,089.14. The Nasdaq inched up 0.33 point to 5,102.81.

The downing of the Russian plane added new complexity to the crisis in Syria. Russia denied its jets had violated Turkish airspace, said it had been betrayed by Turkey, and warned of severe consequences. NATO worked to reduce tensions at an extraordinary meeting.

The Conference Board, a business research group, said consumer confidence in the United States sank this month to its lowest in a year as Americans worried about the job market. That was a surprise after strong job gains in October. Consumer discretionary stocks including Netflix and Amazon slipped.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Tuesday. 17,850 17,800 Previous close 17,792.68 17,750 17,700 17,650 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Research, said the confidence report was a surprise because consumers had a lot of reasons to feel good right now. Employers are hiring and Americans have more money to spend because inflation and gas prices are low. There is also evidence that wages are increasing.

“It’s hard to explain,” he said, adding that he thought consumer confidence would improve in December.

Crude oil rose $1.12, or 2.7 percent, to $42.87 a barrel in New York. Before that, the price of United States crude had fallen to its lowest since August. Brent crude rose $1.29, or 2.9 percent, to $46.12 a barrel in London.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline climbed 7.7 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $1.39 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $1.40 a gallon. Natural gas missed out on the rally, down 1 cent to $2.20 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Energy stocks rose 2.1 percent, by far the largest gain in the S.&P. 500 index. Exxon Mobil rose $1.60, or 2 percent, to $81.88 and Chevron gained $1.34, or 1.5 percent, to close at $91.35.

The rising price of oil was one of several pieces of bad news for travel stocks like booking sites and airlines. Higher oil prices mean increased fuel costs, and they also leave consumers with less money for travel. The sector was also battered by a global travel warning from the State Department and the drop in consumer confidence, which suggests that Americans might become nervous about spending money on vacations.

5-Year Treasury Notes High yields at auction. 1.8 % 1.6 1.4 1.670% 1.2 ’14 ’15

The State Department advised travelers that groups including the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Boko Haram continue to plan terrorist attacks, and Americans should be particularly alert around the holidays. Helane Becker, an analyst for Cowen & Company, said bookings might slump after that warning, but any dip probably would not last long.

“There’s usually a decline in bookings in the short term,” she said. “I suspect that people who have planned their vacations around the holidays will continue to go, but perhaps people who are booking will stay stateside or not go at all.”

Priceline sank $24.14, or 1.9 percent, to $1,240.18 and a competitor, Expedia, shed $3.65, or 3.7 percent, to close at $121.27. Among airlines, United fell $1.76, or 3 percent, to $56.80 and Southwest dropped $1.24, or 2.6 percent, to $46.23. Royal Caribbean lost $2.91, or 3.1 percent, to close at $92.02 and Carnival fell $1, or 2 percent, to $50.39.

Quarterly earnings reports continued to roll in. Signet, the jewelry company whose brands include Kay Jewelers, Jared and Zale, reported profit and revenue that were lower than expected. Its stock dropped $5.76, or 4.1 percent, to $134.89.

“The Santa Claus rally got an early start,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial, referring to the gains that typically happen between Christmas and New Year’s Day. “If we can hold on to this, we will be setting up for a good January.”

James Moffett is riding into the sunset. Mr. Moffett, Freeport-McMoRan’s longtime leader, is resigning as executive chairman of the $9 billion copper, gold and petroleum company facing pressure from the activist investor Carl C. Icahn. It’s a needed step to restore confidence after faux pas including an ill-timed, cozy-looking 2012 oil deal. Mr. Moffett’s replacement, though, faces serious challenges.

The departing chairman casts a long shadow. Mr. Moffett helped found McMoRan Oil & Gas in 1969 before merging it with Freeport Minerals in 1981 and eventually turning it into one of the world’s leading copper and gold producers. The sudden end to his long reign, coupled with another swing lower in commodity prices, may explain the more than 8 percent drop in Freeport’s share price on Monday.

That, though, looks like an overreaction. Freeport’s shares have plunged around 80 percent since the company struck a pair of questionable oil deals in late 2012. The acquisitions of Plains Exploration & Production and McMoRan Exploration for a combined $20 billion including debt were not only poorly timed, given the subsequent collapse in crude prices. They also raised serious governance questions: Mr. Moffett ran and partly owned McMoRan, while Plains’s boss, James Flores, sat on McMoRan’s board at the time. In January, Freeport agreed to pay $138 million to settle a lawsuit brought by investors asserting conflicts of interest.

It took the arrival of Mr. Icahn to usher in more serious change. He has already had success in the sector: In 2012 he started agitating for management change at Chesapeake Energy, another troubled resources company. Its larger-than-life founder Aubrey McClendon was gone within a year.

The activist investor revealed his Freeport stake in August this year. By October, the company announced it was dismantling its three-member office of the chairman — comprising Mr. Moffett, Mr. Flores and the chief executive, Richard Adkerson — and considering strategic alternatives for its oil and gas business.

Monday’s shake-up is another welcome sign of a newly assertive board. The new nonexecutive chairman, Gerald J. Ford, previously the lead independent director, has his work cut out to get the company in shape for lower commodity prices. And he’s not completely free of Mr. Moffett, who will be chairman emeritus and stay on as a consultant to the board for a time, potentially complicating efforts at a truly clean break. Over all, though, the changes are positive for Freeport shareholders.",Exit of Freeport Chairman Eases Credibility Problem,2015-12-29,James Moffett is leaving the mining company he helped found facing pressure from the activist investor Carl Icahn.

1558,"Stocks posted solid gains in a quiet session on Wednesday, helped by advances in health care and industrial companies.

Without any major economic reports to influence investors, trading was lighter than usual. Many investors were awaiting the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, to be released on Thursday, and the start of the corporate earnings season.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 122.10 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,912.29. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 15.91 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,995.83 and the Nasdaq composite rose 42.79 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,791.15.

The biggest gainers were stocks that were hit hardest the day before: health care, particularly biotechnology companies, and energy stocks. The drug maker Amgen rose nearly 5 percent, Celgene rose 4 percent and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals rose nearly 6 percent.

By far, the biggest loser in the S.&P. 500 was Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Yum shares sank $15.75, or 19 percent, to $67.67 after its profits and sales missed analysts’ expectations. Sales in China, a major market for KFC, rose only 2 percent, far less than expected.

Events over the next two weeks are likely to determine the market’s next move. Earnings season will unofficially start Thursday when Alcoa, the giant maker of aluminum and other metals, will report its results.

Expectations for this round of earnings are low. Analysts expect third-quarter results to be down 5.1 percent from last year, according to FactSet, which would be the first back-to-back quarterly drop in earnings since 2009.

“Expectations are so low this quarter that it’s not going to be hard for companies to beat,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.

Another lingering concern is the direction of the global economy. Fears of a downturn were stoked by a report from the International Monetary Fund suggesting that China’s slowdown and tumbling commodity prices will push global economic growth this year to the lowest level since the 2009 recession.

10-Year Treasury Notes High yield in monthly refunding auction. 3.0 % 2.066% 2.6 2.2 1.8 ’14 ’15

With that in mind, companies, particularly those with exposure to businesses outside the United States, are likely to be in focus this quarter, Mr. Ablin said.

Oil prices gave up an early gain and turned lower after the Energy Department reported that domestic oil inventories rose by 3.1 million barrels last week and that demand for oil fell slightly. Oil had rallied earlier on signs that producers were cutting back production.

Benchmark United States oil fell 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $47.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, lost 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $51.33 a barrel in London.

But employment at the centuries-old dye pits has dropped to 250 people, from nearly 1,500 a decade ago. Chinese companies produce virtually identical patterns of fabrics using synthetic dyes, and their sales now dominate in Kano’s open-air market.

“They are learning our arts and taking them to their country and doing them similarly to us, and bringing the goods back to Nigeria and selling them to our people,” said Bala Ibrahim, 45, who has labored in the pits since his early teens. Now he spends whole days idle.

Such stories are common across Nigeria’s garment industry. The city’s tanneries, which made Moroccan leather from goatskins for centuries, have laid off most of their staffs. Dozens of modern fabric factories on the outskirts of Kano have closed.

In theory, Nigeria should have a manufacturing edge, at least in labor-intensive industries like sewing.

With high unemployment in Nigeria, factory owners can easily find workers willing to accept the minimum wage, just $80 a month. By comparison, garment factories in coastal China now pay around $550 a month and still can’t find enough workers.

Despite the high cost of labor, it remains cheaper and easier to mass-produce garments in China.

One obstacle to setting up a large-scale sewing industry like Bangladesh’s is that Nigeria imposes significant tariffs on imported fabric, a legacy of its past as a big producer of hand-woven fabric and as a large grower of cotton. Another challenge is that electricity from Nigeria’s national grid is unreliable. So operations must rely on diesel generators, buying fuel at a cost per kilowatt-hour generated that is six times what garment makers in China pay.

The Nigerian government wants to revive manufacturing, particularly given low prices now for its oil exports. Abdulkadir Musa, the recently retired permanent secretary of Nigeria’s ministry of industry, trade and investment, said the government was mulling reductions in tariffs on garment materials that are not produced in Nigeria, possibly including buttons. “We want to start that all over now that oil is no longer at a high price,” Mr. Musa said, adding that overreliance on oil exports “has been more of a problem for us than a solution.”

For now, Nigerians just can’t compete.

Chimezie Cyril Okwuosa scrimped for years to set up his own small garment factory near Lagos in 2005. He had 25 sewing machines, 30 workers and a noisy diesel generator. The factory failed within five years.

“I was spending so much on diesel that at the end of the day, I had no profit — and some days, there was no diesel at all, and I could not operate,” Mr. Okwuosa said.

Mr. Okwuosa now runs Greentomato Apparels, a small-scale importer of children’s trousers. He pays $2.50 a pair to a factory in Guangzhou, China, and then only 10 or 12 cents a pair for shipping. He sells the pants for about $3.25 a pair, leaving him a small profit margin.

The collapse of manufacturing is more than just a financial issue.

It has also fanned worries about the possible spread of Boko Haram, an insurgency condemned for its large-scale abductions and sexual enslavement of women and girls. Boko Haram has drawn young men to its ranks in destitute northeastern Nigeria, the country’s poorest region.

Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, the traditional ruler of Kano in northern Nigeria, has seen the devastation up close. Outside his palace, a low maroon building with battlements, is a large burn mark. Late last year, a group linked by the government to Boko Haram set off three bombs in a large crowd and then used automatic weapons to spray bullets at the survivors. As many as 500 people were killed.

“The Chinese basically copy every textile product in Nigeria,” Emir Sanusi said. “I worry about what could happen to Kano when we have a large number of youths and large numbers of industries are down.”

A Flood of Chinese Steel

At a Lagos steelyard of Dorman-Long Engineering, the only activity on a recent afternoon was the welding of an oil storage tank. With the steep drop in world oil prices, longtime customers like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are no longer commissioning as many helipads and footbridges for their offshore drilling platforms.

The locally owned engineering firm had expected Chinese construction companies operating in Nigeria to help offset the slump. But Chinese construction companies, mostly state-owned, have largely imported their steel girders, reinforcing beams and other materials from home.

“I just don’t see a lot of local content in what they do,” said Timi Austen-Peters, the company’s chairman.

Infrastructure financed and built by China was supposed to be the great hope for Nigeria.

Nigeria endured coups and a civil war in the 1960s, then effectively nationalized many foreign-owned companies in the 1970s. Nigeria developed a reputation for breaking or renegotiating contracts, antagonizing many foreign partners.

The risks have prompted Western companies to demand very fat profits before putting money into the country — returns on the order of 25 to 40 percent a year. Their Chinese counterparts have been willing to accept 10 percent or less.

“Unless the West changes its risk assessment, the Chinese will beat them to the African market,” said Osadebe Osakwe, a former Nigerian banker who is now the managing director of North China Construction Nigeria. The company is a subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise in Beijing. “The Chinese are trying to prove that they can do what the Western companies can do and they can do it better.”

Chinese companies have piled into the country. Mostly state-owned Chinese construction companies have started $24.6 billion worth of projects since 2005, the highest of anywhere in the world, according to the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research group.

“Africa has a real demand for infrastructure and industrial developments — in those areas, China has strong ability and surplus capacity to invest and build,” China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, said during a visit to Nigeria last year.

But as demand at home falters, Chinese companies have been shipping huge quantities of steel girders, piping and other industrial materials at extremely low prices to emerging markets like Nigeria. So there is little benefit for local players like Dorman-Long Engineering that used to fabricate much of this equipment.

Executives at Chinese construction companies say they do buy some local materials. But they add that China’s exports are often more readily available and better made, so they can be quickly and reliably included in complex projects.

The new Nigerian government is starting to question whether all the construction projects are in the country’s best interest. Many projects, like new international or refurbished airport terminals in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt, help the country’s elite but may do less for the poor.

The new government is now searching for signs of fraud, corruption or other misconduct in existing contracts. President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria announced on Aug. 10 that his government had already found that hundreds of millions of dollars were mysteriously diverted from one Chinese-backed rail project to other government projects, although it was not immediately clear if corruption was involved.

Bullet Train Boondoggle

The pride of the previous Nigerian administration, which left office in May, was supposed to be a new passenger train line that links Abuja to Kaduna. With trains traveling at nearly 120 miles per hour, the $874 million line is supposed to cut the three-hour highway trip in half.

But the line may not draw many passengers.

A graceful new train station is a 40-minute drive from downtown, surrounded by cornfields and cow pastures. The extension of the line into downtown Abuja has been severely delayed, and money is running short for its completion. And even though Nigeria desperately needs more freight trains, the rail line with its fragile-looking bridges is too lightly built to support heavily laden cargo cars.

The fate of the line — like dozens of Chinese projects around Nigeria — is a potential problem for Beijing.

Infrastructure projects in Nigeria have been fueled by the same manic lending that has also created mountains of debt for China’s economy at home. State-controlled Chinese banks have lent money at rock-bottom interest rates in deeply indebted Nigeria.

They have done so based on the assumption that the Chinese government will repay them if Nigeria cannot.

A little-known Chinese government agency, Sinosure, has guaranteed the loans. Sinosure insured $427 billion worth of Chinese exports and overseas construction projects around the world in 2013, the most recent year available. The Export-Import Bank of the United States, by comparison, issued just $5 billion worth of credit in each of the last two years.

Nigeria is a particularly shaky bet for China. The corruption investigations could prompt the government to cancel contracts outright. Government revenue has dropped by more than half since the fall in world oil prices, so the country may not have the money to make good on the Chinese deals.

The riskiest projects of all may be those like the high-speed rail line that are widely viewed as the previous administration’s vanity projects.

A Chinese construction manager at the new station on Abuja’s outskirts, who identified himself only as Mr. Zhang, said the project would be finished by next March. It was only behind schedule, he added, because of shipping delays.

“We’re waiting for materials from China,” Mr. Zhang said, “like toilets.”","In Nigeria, Chinese Investment Comes With a Downside",2015-12-06,"Like other developing countries, Nigeria has welcomed Chinese trade, but that relationship has left the country awash in shoddy imported goods and has cost many Nigerians their jobs.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/business/international/in-nigeria-chinese-investment-comes-with-a-downside.html

“Drill, Baby, Drill” became a popular campaign mantra back in the 2008 election cycle. But now we’re hearing the opposite call: “Leave It in the Ground.”

These calls come from environmentalists who see the end of drilling and mining as the way to avoid disruptive climate change. They direct these calls toward the federal government because it is estimated that about half of the carbon in technologically recoverable fossil fuels in the United States is on public lands.

Is there a middle ground that can supply the energy we need without causing significant climate damages? Yes. And it doesn’t involve exploiting all available resources, nor banning their use.

What if we continued to lease the rights to access fossil fuels on federal land but required the leases and royalty payments to reflect the full climate damages from these fuels? Doing so would put the market to work by unlocking fossil fuels that have the highest value in relation to their impact on the climate. The bonus: It provides money to pay for some of the damage of climate change.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We’ve seen the benefits of using our domestic resources over the last decade as the amount of our energy coming from domestic oil and gas resources increased 54 percent. Chiefly, we have lower fuel prices. We now pay 74 percent less for natural gas and 25 percent less for petroleum, compared with 2005. Further, net imports will account for just 23 percent of American liquid fuel supplies this year — down from 60 percent in 2005 — with important energy security benefits. Our carbon emissions are also below 2005 levels, with cheap natural gas having taken significant market share from coal, which is more carbon intensive.

At the same time, the combustion of fossil fuels causes climate change that is projected to impose myriad costs around the world. But in this regard, not all fossil fuels are created equal. The value per unit of energy, measured by the market price, is greater for some (like petroleum) than others (like coal). Further, some contain more carbon or result in the release of more emissions because of other factors like the extraction and transportation process, and inflict greater climate damages. Knowing the monetary value of climate damages associated with a ton of carbon emissions is therefore the key to this whole problem.

Luckily, there is a way to determine this. It is called the Social Cost of Carbon (S.C.C.), and the federal government sets it at $40 per metric ton of CO2 emissions. The S.C.C. is used to inform a wide variety of regulations that limit the use of fossil fuels, including emissions standards for vehicles, appliances and power plants. But the S.C.C. has not been used to guide extraction policies. (I was co-leader of an interagency group that set the S.C.C. when I worked in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2010.)

If the S.C.C. were applied as a part of leasing and royalty rates on federal lands, we would unlock resources with the greatest net benefits. To illustrate the consequences of such a shift, I did some calculations based on the spot prices for coal, petroleum and natural gas and their respective energy and carbon contents. The addition of a charge based on the S.C.C. is unlikely to have a substantial effect on domestic production of petroleum: The spot price per million British thermal units (B.T.U.s) this year has been $8.81, and the associated climate damages are $2.98. If the federal government collected a charge of $2.98 for each million B.T.U.s of petroleum extracted on federal lands, the revenue could be refunded directly to taxpayers or used to help the nation adapt to climate damages. The story is similar for natural gas; its value today exceeds the expected climate damages.

The case of coal is different, especially coal from the federal land in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. The climate damages from coal mined from this region are five to six times greater than its market value ($0.66 at market value versus $3.89 of climate damages). Thus, a climate charge linked to the S.C.C. would probably make at least some of the coal mining in this region unprofitable. There is currently an opportunity for policy overhaul: The Department of the Interior is considering how to restructure lease terms for fossil fuels on federal lands. Further, a federal judge ruled last year that the government should take into account climate impacts when making decisions about mining on federal lands.

The application of an S.C.C.-related fee would meet many goals. Environmentalists would naturally like it, and so should fiscal conservatives who recognize that the federal government will be increasingly on the hook for climate damages (recall the more than $50 billion of federal tax dollars appropriated in response to Hurricane Sandy). At the same time, this fee would not stop the development of economically attractive fossil fuels.

Such a change in policy would have challenges. There would inevitably be some shifting of fossil fuel production to private lands in the United States, as well as to other countries; but it would also reduce the long-run global supply of fossil fuels. Further, there would be a strong case for harmonizing S.C.C. charges with existing domestic climate regulations to ensure that the carbon policies operate as efficiently as possible. There is also a strong case for providing support to communities that experience meaningful declines in economic activity because of an extraction fee linked to the S.C.C.

An efficient climate policy would price carbon throughout the global economy so that users of all fossil fuels recognized their climate costs. It does not appear likely that the current Paris climate negotiations will produce such a system. In the absence of such a policy, the solution doesn’t need to be to use all fossil fuels, or to ban their usage. Common sense suggests that we use the ones that provide more value than harm and that we leave the others in the ground.

MOSCOW — The Russian energy giant Gazprom announced on Wednesday that it had halted deliveries of natural gas to Ukraine because of a pricing dispute.

Gazprom has not received advance payment for deliveries of natural gas in July, Alexey B. Miller, the chief executive of Gazprom, said in a statement on Wednesday, and had cut the flow of natural gas to Ukraine immediately.

“Gazprom will not deliver gas to Ukraine at any price without prepayment,” Mr. Miller said.

One day earlier, Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state energy company, said it would cease buying Russian gas because of disputes over prices and the breakdown of talks mediated by the European Union to negotiate a new contract.

Russia briefly cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine in June 2014 amid a growing conflict between the Ukrainian Army and pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine after the ouster of the president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Disputes over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine had also led to shut-offs in 2006 and 2008.

Gazprom, which is controlled by the Russian government, raised prices on gas after Mr. Yanukovych’s ouster. On Monday, the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, announced a third-quarter gas price of $247.18 per thousand cubic meters for Ukraine, close to a $40 discount on Russia’s benchmark price. Previously, Russia had given the Ukrainians a $100 discount on the gas price, partly in exchange for leasing rights to the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. That discount was canceled after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014.

Analysts say that Ukraine has sufficient stores of gas to make it through the summer, when consumption is low. Ukraine has claimed that it can supplement its supplies by purchasing Russian gas exported to other countries, like Slovakia.

Ildar Davletshin, an oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital, noted that the instability in Ukraine would most likely delay a long-term agreement over gas supplies from Russia.

“Possibly Russia does not want to increase its exposure to Ukraine, the risk of growing loans,” Mr. Davletshin said. “Also, they can use this as a way to put some pressure on the Ukrainian government.”

Ukraine is a transit corridor for Russian gas exports to the European Union, but Mr. Davletshin said the supply cut had “no critical implications short term in terms of consumption or gas flow to Europe.” He added that Ukraine would likely have to strike a deal in the fall in order to replenish stores of natural gas before colder temperatures set in.",Gazprom Halts Natural Gas Deliveries to Ukraine,2015-07-02,The Russian energy giant cut off deliveries because of a pricing dispute amid political tensions between Russia and Ukraine.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/world/europe/gazprom-halts-natural-gas-deliveries-to-ukraine.html

1591,"Stocks posted their biggest gains in more than a week Tuesday, led by rising energy companies and banks.

The market was higher all day, building on a gain late Monday. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose two days in a row for the first time since early November. Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil jumped 3 percent, and banks moved higher a day before an expected rate increase by the Federal Reserve.

The Dow Jones industrial average added 156.41 points, or 0.9 percent, to 17,524.91. The S.&P. 500 increased 21.47 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,043.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 43.13 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,995.36.

Stocks have been turbulent since a six-week winning streak ended in early November. They dropped sharply in mid-November, then bounced back the next week, but did not build consistently on those gains.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Tuesday. 17,650 17,550 17,450 Previous close 17,368.50 17,350 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

Last week, a plunge in the price of oil set off a sharp drop in energy stocks, which dragged the broader market down to its second-worst weekly performance of 2015. Now with more encouraging economic signs, many expect the Fed to begin returning borrowing costs to normal levels with its first interest rate increase in nine years.

The government said early Tuesday that prices for a variety of goods and services rose last month, including plane tickets and medical care. Overall prices were unchanged from last year because food and energy prices are weak, but “core inflation,” which leaves out energy and food, rose 0.2 percent. That is the largest gain in more than a year.

Michelle Girard, chief United States economist for Royal Bank of Scotland, said the reassuring signal on inflation gave the Fed “a green light to take action tomorrow.” The Fed’s major short-term interest rate has been near zero for seven years.

Energy stocks were the top-performing sector as United States crude rose $1.04, or 2.9 percent, to $37.35 a barrel in New York. That was atop a 2 percent gain on Monday. Oil is still down 30 percent this year and is at its lowest in more than six years. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose 53 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $38.45 a barrel in London.

That helped the energy sector, which has struggled this year. Exxon Mobil had its best day since late August. Its shares jumped $3.40, or 4.5 percent, to $79.43. Shares in the offshore drilling company Ensco added $1.21, or 8 percent, to $16.40 and Transocean stock rose 74 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $13.38.

Natural gas continued to tumble, sliding 7.2 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $1.822 per 1,000 cubic feet. That is the lowest price since March 1999, not adjusting for inflation. Industrial demand for natural gas has been weak, and the warm weather means most Americans have not needed as much heat for their homes as they usually do this time of year.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 1.1 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.2444 a gallon and heating oil rose 1.9 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $1.147 a gallon.

Bank stocks climbed as investors anticipated that higher interest rates would help banks become more profitable by charging more for loans. JPMorgan Chase shares rose $1.83, or 2.9 percent, to $66.10 and stock in Wells Fargo gained $1.71, or 3.2 percent, to $54.91.

Investors dipped a toe back into the high-yield bond market after several days of selling.

The iShares high-yield corporate bond ETF rose $1.29, or 1.6 percent, to $80.12 and the SPDR Barclays high-yield bond ETF rose 39 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $33.81.

High-yield bonds have been attractive in recent years because their returns are generous. But investors are becoming worried that more companies could default.

Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said plunging oil prices were a big contributor to the recent decline. He predicts more pain is coming.

“Buyers of high-yield bonds will be, on average, pretty happy five years from now,” he said. “But I think they’re going to be pretty unhappy in the next three months.”

Prices for United States government bonds, which are considered extremely low-risk, fell. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 2.27 percent from 2.23 percent late Monday.

Gold fell $1.80 to $1,062.90 an ounce, while silver gained 7.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $13.77 an ounce. Copper fell 5.5 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.06 per pound.

1593,"Stocks fell on Thursday as a late drop erased the market’s gains from the day before. Companies that sell oil, gold and silver declined along with the prices of those commodities.

The slide on Thursday ended a three-day winning streak. Indexes drifted lower in the morning and fell sharply in the final minutes of trading. Energy stocks sank as the price of oil slumped again, and lower metals prices hurt mining companies.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 253.25 points, or 1.4 percent, to 17,495.84. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 31.18 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,041.89. The Nasdaq gave up 68.58 points, or 1.4 percent, to 5,002.55.

Energy and mining stocks have been pummeled this year as the sluggish global economy reduces demand even as supplies become more abundant. United States crude fell 57 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $34.95 a barrel in New York. It had not settled beneath $35 since Feb. 18, 2009, and traded above $60 a barrel as recently as June.

Chevron shares lost $2.90, or 3.1 percent, to $90.54, and Marathon Oil shares lost $1, or 7.3 percent, to $12.78.

Natural gas, which has fallen to 16-year lows, gave up another 3.5 cents, or 2 percent, to $1.755 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of natural gas has tumbled as demand has collapsed. Thanks to warm weather, customers have not needed much gas to heat their homes this winter. And demand from industrial customers has been weak.

Metals prices gave up their gains from Wednesday. The price of gold fell $27.20 to $1,050.80 an ounce, and silver dropped 54.5 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $13.703 an ounce. Copper fell 2.8 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.044 a pound.

Among mining stocks, Newmont Mining shares dropped $1.47, or 7.7 percent, to $17.61, and Freeport-McMoRan shares lost 57 cents, or 8.5 percent, to $6.12.

Only utility stocks traded higher. Utilities have also struggled this year, but they have risen for four days in a row and are up 4 percent over that time.

Utility stocks are seen as steady performers that pay regular dividends, and some investors think payments are going to increase. Duke Energy shares rose 47 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $70.50, and Ameren shares gained $1.03, or 2.4 percent, to $44.03.

Solar power stocks continued to rise after Congress agreed to extend a federal tax credit for commercial and residential solar projects.

Leading Democrats and Republicans reportedly agreed to extend the 30 percent credit through 2019, after which it will wind down over two years. The credit was scheduled to decrease in 2017 and be eliminated in 2018.

SolarCity shares gained $3.57, or 6.7 percent, to $57.26, and the stock is up 55 percent this week. Sunrun shares added $1.08, or 9.3 percent, to $12.71; the stock is up 62 percent for the week.

Angelica Jarvenpaa, a research associate for Raymond James, said one of the biggest risks that had confronted solar power companies over the last year was they didn’t know if the tax credit would be allowed to expire.

Ms. Jarvenpaa said the agreement was “among the best-case scenarios” for solar power because it tells companies what they can expect for the next several years. She added that the extension would benefit the entire industry, including companies that serve homes, businesses, utilities and manufacturers of solar cells.

Pandora Media surged. A panel of copyright judges raised the amount that music streaming companies like Pandora have to pay to record labels, but the increase was less than many had expected. Pandora shares jumped $1.82, or 13.5 percent, to $15.26.

The business software maker Oracle had its worst day in more than two years. Its stock slipped after Oracle reported a smaller quarterly profit. Its revenue also fell short of analyst forecasts. The shares declined $1.98, or 5.1 percent, to $36.93.

The dollar climbed. While the Fed is raising interest rates, central banks in Europe and Japan are planning to lower them. That will make the dollar even stronger. A strong dollar hurts American exporters but makes imports cheaper. The euro dropped to $1.0817 from $1.0913. The dollar rose to 122.69 yen from 122.13 yen.

1598,"Stocks rallied broadly on Monday, ending a three-day losing streak as investors moved past concerns that the terrorist attacks in Paris could hurt the global economy.

Oil and gas stocks were among the biggest gainers. The price of crude rose. Traders also bid up shares in military contractors, while travel-related stocks slumped.

The gains followed an uneven day in European markets, which shook off an early loss and ended mixed.

“It all comes down to, are consumers going to be staying at home and not out spending money because they’re afraid that if they go anywhere they’re going to be victims of a terrorist attack?” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “That might be the case if you saw a series of these things, but hopefully that’s not what’s going to happen, and the economy is not going to be affected.”

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 237.77 points, or 1.4 percent, to 17,483.01. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 30.15 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,053.19. The Nasdaq composite index added 56.73 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,984.62.

The rally helped lift the market after its biggest weekly loss since August.

Major stock indexes wavered for much of the morning as investors sorted through the latest company earnings and economic reports. Traders pushed stocks higher by noon and for much of the afternoon until the final hour of trading, when the rally evaporated.

Investors, who have been worried that sales could be weak this holiday season, sold retailers that reported disappointing quarterly results.

Urban Outfitters fell 3.8 percent after its latest quarterly sales fell short. The stock dropped 87 cents to $21.80. Dick’s Sporting Goods slumped 9.4 percent after reporting worse-than-expected results and giving a weak outlook. The stock fell $3.85 to $36.96.

Other big retailers fared better.

Walmart shares rose 3.5 percent after the company reported improved customer traffic and an increase in an important sales figure for the third quarter, even as a stronger dollar hurt its performance overseas. The company, the world’s largest retailer, also issued a forecast for the holiday shopping season that largely beat Wall Street expectations. The stock rose $2.05 to $59.92.

Stock in Home Depot climbed 4.4 percent after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue, and delivered an upbeat fiscal outlook. The stock rose $5.34 to $126.18.

Traders also watched economic reports. The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in October after falling in August and September.

The small increase in inflation could make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin raising short-term interest rates from historical lows next month, said David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management.

“Historically, hiking interest rates would not be good for the stock market, but at this point it’s a psychological boost that the economy is self-sustaining enough that the Fed could get off the zero interest rate policy,” Mr. Chalupnik said.

The energy sector shed 1.2 percent, extending its losses this year to 15.9 percent. The sector, which is the S.&P. 500 index’s biggest decliner for the year, has been hurt by the protracted slide in oil prices.

That decline resumed on Tuesday. Benchmark United States crude oil dropped $1.08 to settle at $41.71 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 99 cents to $43.57 a barrel in London.

Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.238 a gallon, heating oil fell 1.7 cents to $1.368 a gallon and natural gas fell 1.4 cents to $2.371 per 1,000 cubic feet.

European indexes moved higher, partly because of a report showing that business optimism in Germany rose more than analysts had expected this month, thanks to strong domestic demand and a weaker euro.

London — A painting by Gustav Klimt that has been in private hands for over a century will be auctioned at Sotheby’s Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale here on June 24. The work, “Portrait of Gertrud Loew,” painted in 1902, has an estimated sale price of 12 million to 18 million pounds (about $18 million to $28 million), and is for sale as a result of a settlement between the Felsovanyi family, the heirs of the painting’s subject, and the Klimt Foundation.

The painting depicts the 19-year-old daughter of a well-known Viennese physician, Dr. Anton Loew, who had treated Klimt (along with the composer Gustav Mahler and the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein) in his private sanatorium. The painting remained in the family until Gertrud Loew, widowed after marrying a Hungarian industrialist, Elemer Baruch von Felsovanyi, left Vienna for the United States in 1939, fleeing Nazi persecution.

The painting passed into the hands of Gustav Ucicky, a film director and one of Klimt’s sons, who acquired a number of his father’s works. After his death in 1961, the collection was left to his wife, Ursula, who established the Klimt Foundation in 2013.

“A condition of Mrs. Ucicky’s gift to the foundation was that their provenance would be resolved,” Lucian Simmons, the worldwide head of restitution for Sotheby’s, said in a telephone interview. “There was a broad effort on her part to find a resolution.”

Mr. Simmons added that an additional five drawings by Klimt that the foundation owns are being transferred back to the Felsovanyi family as part of the agreement between the two parties. The proceeds of the auction will be shared by the foundation and the family, although Mr. Simmons said he was not party to the details of the agreement.

Helena Newman, a co-head of worldwide Impressionist and Modern art at Sotheby’s, said that the price estimate was in line with an unfinished oil portrait of Ria Munk that sold for about $29 million in 2010. “There is very little to compare this painting to, as most Klimts are in museums and portraits are really rare,” Ms. Newman said in a telephone interview.

The painting, which shows the young Gertrud Loew in a blue-trimmed gauzy dress, is “stylistically coming out of the 19th century,” and predates Klimt’s gold period, Ms. Newman said. (In 2006, Ronald S. Lauder paid $135 million for Klimt’s 1907 “Adele Bloch-Bauer I,” an example of that period, for the Neue Galerie in New York.)

“This is one of the few remaining opportunities to buy a full-worked oil portrait by Klimt, and the story of the restitution is part of its commercial value, because it hasn’t changed hands and comes to auction completely fresh,” Ms. Newman said.",Klimt’s ‘Portrait of Gertrud Loew’ to Be Auctioned,2015-06-02,"The 1902 painting, which has been in private hands for over a century, is estimated at $18 million to $28 million.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/arts/design/klimts-portrait-of-gertrud-loew-to-be-auctioned.html

A weak report from Macy’s pushed retail stocks lower, and energy shares retreated as the price of oil fell.

Macy’s plunged 14 percent, its largest one-day drop in seven years. Other retailers slumped as investors took its results as a warning about third-quarter sales and the coming holiday shopping season.

October’s big rally is fading into the distance, but most of the market’s recent losses have been small. Stocks have lost ground for five of the last six trading days, leaving the market with a meager gain for the year to date.

Macy’s third-quarter sales were lower than analysts had expected, prompting the company, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, to cut its profit forecast for the year. Macy’s also said it would close more stores. Its shares sank $6.58, to $40.44.

Paul Lejuez, a Citi Research investment analyst, said fewer people bought winter clothes like boots and coats in the third quarter because the weather was warm. That meant they were less likely to go shopping for clothes at all, so inventories built up and discounts increased — a troubling sign less than three weeks before Black Friday.

“That’s bad for anybody that competes against Macy’s,” Mr. Lejuez said.

Investors dumped shares of other retailers.

The American Petroleum Institute said supplies grew by 6.3 million barrels, far more than had analysts expected, according to Phil Flynn, an analyst for the Price Futures Group. United States crude slid $1.28, to $42.93 a barrel in New York, and Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, lost $1.63, to close at $45.81 a barrel in London.

Trading started unevenly on Friday. The major indexes were all down by midmorning as traders examined the latest corporate earnings.

The biotechnology company Biogen and the pharmaceutical company AbbVie both reported better-than-expected second-quarter profits, but their revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Biogen plunged $85.02, or 22.1 percent, to $300.03. AbbVie declined $2.44, or 3.5 percent, to $68.08.

Shares of American Airlines, the largest carrier in the world, fell nearly 7 percent after it said that revenue for each seat flown one mile, a crucial measure, would drop by between 6 and 8 percent in the third quarter. Still, American said cheaper fuel costs helped it nearly double its second-quarter profit to $1.7 billion.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained 43 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $14.12. Sales of hardware for data centers, including servers and networking devices, improved.

Hormel, which makes Spam, said it was planning a stock split that would double the number of shares on the market, which could increase demand. Its shares rose $2.23, or 3 percent, to $73.55. The stock gained 3 percent Tuesday after the company reported a strong fourth quarter and outlook, and it has been trading at record highs.

Energy stocks, which surged on Tuesday, gave back some of their gains, though the price of oil increased slightly. The government said crude oil stockpiles rose last week; they are at their highest levels in at least 80 years.

1661,"Fears over slowing global growth hammered stocks in the United States and Europe on Friday and lifted prices of government bonds and other assets seen as safer bets.

The selling pushed down major stock indexes in Europe before spreading to the United States. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index slumped to its biggest loss in more than two weeks as all 10 industry sectors of the broad market gauge fell. The drop was led by energy shares.

A day earlier, the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates near zero. That means borrowing costs will remain low for a while, a prospect that has typically helped stocks. But some investors, expecting the Fed would be confident enough to nudge rates up by at least a quarter of a point, interpreted the stand-pat stance as a sign that the global economy was dangerously weak.

“If growth in the strongest economy — the United States — isn’t strong enough to raise rates even a quarter of point, what does that say about the prospects for global growth?” said Bill Strazzullo, chief strategist at market research firm Bell Curve Trading.

Julian Emanuel, a UBS strategist, said a mix of other factors also may have fed the selling Friday, including a slowdown in China, an expected decline in third-quarter earnings and the prospect that a dispute in Congress next month over funding for Planned Parenthood could lead to a government shutdown.

“When you add up the Fed, China, the cloudy earnings outlook and possibly a government shutdown, it’s not a surprise that the market has had a defensive reaction,” Mr. Emanuel said.

1672,"Glencore’s shtick has long been that it is the master of the commodity markets. It knows when to take risks, it can shift supply to where it’s most wanted and it tweaks its own mines to maximise profit. Or at least it can do all that when everyone else behaves rationally. That thinking has come unstuck, and the British-Swiss commodities trader’s earnings have gone with it. They halved in the first six months of 2015.

The trading business of shuffling metals, oil and agricultural goods around the world that accounted for 76 percent of Glencore’s operating profit in the first half of 2015 proved fairly resilient, thanks to extensive hedges funded with cheap debt. But tumbling prices still take their toll. For example, trading profit was hurt by the collapse in the premium buyers have to pay to get hold of aluminium right away.

Mining is much worse. Glencore’s staples of coal and copper are selling at multiyear low prices. A 10 percent fall in the price of copper knocks $1.3 billion off Glencore’s full-year operating profit. The red metal has slid more than 20 percent since May alone. Coal, at a 12-year low, is a similar story. Glencore got that wrong in its 2013 merger with coal-rich Xstrata.

If only high-cost miners were behaving rationally, by closing down. But around 70 percent of Chinese coal miners are operating at a loss, according to the country’s National Development and Reform Commission. Production is declining but imports are dropping faster, down 34 percent in the first seven months of 2015, year-on-year. China’s aluminium exports, meanwhile, are increasing, in effect giving foreigners the benefits of the state-subsidized electricity used in smelting.

Glencore is sensibly targeting the one commodity it can sort of control: cash. Capital expenditure plans have been cut and falling commodity prices have reduced the cash tied up in inventories. The company’s net debt fell to $29.6 billion, a drop of 3 percent from the end of 2014.

With commodity price pressure unlikely to abate, focusing on balance sheet stability might be the most rational strategy available.",Glencore Tripped Up by Faith in Rational Markets,2015-08-20,"Earnings have disappointed as copper and coal have tumbled.

1674,"During the same time, colored diamonds have surged in value. Buyers have sought them out for their beauty, extreme rarity and investment potential.

The best-known pink diamonds, for example, are from the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia. That mine, which supplies 90 to 95 percent of the world’s pink diamonds, will be exhausted by 2020, and the scarcity has driven up prices.

“Argyle pink diamonds outperform any other,” said Leibish Polnauer, president of Leibish & Company, a colored-diamond dealer. “They’re less and less available and more and more in demand. Fifteen years ago we bought Argyle pink diamonds for $10,000 a carat. Today it’s $150,000, $200,000, $250,000 a carat.”

Dealers say wealthy buyers in volatile economies view rare, colored diamonds as a hedge against economic uncertainty. A diamond can also be a discreet way to put a tremendous amount of money into something smaller than an aspirin tablet.

“You can buy a large house for $1 million, or about one-half of a carat of a red diamond,” said Yaniv Marcus, founder of the Diamond Investment and Intelligence Center. “A one-carat red diamond could be valued at $2.5 million.”

At the highest end, colored diamond prices have reached a level that rivals rare art works like Amedeo Modigliani’s “Nu Couché,” which sold for $170.4 million at the fall auctions.

“It’s all about rarity,” said Frank Everett, vice president and sales director in the jewelry department at Sotheby’s. “The best ones stand out like a great piece of art.”

In the last year, Sotheby’s has sold two well-known blue diamonds for record-setting prices. A 9.75-carat blue diamond that belonged to the socialite Bunny Mellon sold in November 2014 for $32.6 million — or $3.3 million a carat. Last month, the auction house sold the 12-carat Blue Moon for $48.5 million — or just over $4 million a carat.

Those prices far outstrip the 100-carat white diamond Sotheby’s sold in April for $22 million — or $220,000 a carat.

More broadly, a one-carat fancy pink diamond in a cushion cut is 11.50 times as expensive as a one-carat cushion-cut white diamond that has been judged to be internally flawless and carries the highest color rating, said Eden Rachminov, head of the advisory board of the Fancy Color Resource Foundation. A blue diamond is 20.8 times as expensive as a similar white diamond.

But it is not so simple to jump into the trade just based on the soaring prices. Investors also need to understand the very different ways white and colored diamonds are judged.

With white diamonds, it is the widely known measures of color, cut, clarity and carat weight that drive prices. But investing in white diamonds is a lot like picking quality stocks. There are established measures of quality, relatively transparent pricing, knowable transaction costs and liquidity, at least in smaller carat sizes.

Mr. Rapaport views investments in white diamonds as a way to capitalize on the growth of the global middle class who will buy them as gifts and drive prices back up.

In the world of colored diamonds, what determines value is more subjective. The range of prices for any given colored diamond can vary wildly, corresponding not only to the rarity of their colors but also to the vividness of the color itself. (The so-called chocolate diamonds that mall jewelers are advertising are not considered investments; until fairly recently, they were used for industrial purposes because they are so common.)

“It’s the strength of the color,” said Jordan Fine, president of JFine Inc., a dealer that specializes in colored diamonds. “A light yellow could be $3,000 a carat and a vivid yellow could be $15,000 a carat. A one-carat light pink could be $75,000 to $700,000 a carat for a vivid pink.”

He added, “It’s hard to fathom how expensive and rare that little stone is.”

Yet discerning the vividness of a colored diamond can be more art than science. If white diamonds are likened to stocks, colored diamonds are private equity investments, with all the risk and reward such forays entail.

“Colored diamonds don’t have a price list or somebody managing the value,” Mr. Marcus said. “It’s a true supply-and-demand free trade. It’s like real estate. Its value is what someone will pay for it.”

Mr. Rachminov said the prices of yellows have been stable, tending to track the stock market, but the pinks and blues have soared in value, which has made some industry experts like Mr. Rapaport skeptical. (Red diamonds are at the top but they are exceedingly rare.) “There’s more interest from high-net-worth individuals, just like there’s more demand for art and wine and luxury items in general,” Mr. Rachminov said.

Colored-diamond dealers talk of the stones as a store of value, and they have shown to be over decades. But they are not the easiest investments to sell.

“The approach should be long term,” Mr. Marcus said. “It’s not a trading commodity first of all because of liquidity. The return is exponential over time.”

He also divides colored diamonds into two categories: jewelry and investments. This is by quality but also by the color itself. He said there are not enough orange, green, violet, and purple diamonds to create the liquidity for an investment market. Therefore, most investors focus on blue, pink and red diamonds.

Yet that line between jewelry and investment can get blurred. Sam, who owns a medical business in New Jersey but asked that his last name be withheld for security concerns, has amassed a collection of dozens of colored diamonds. He bought his first pink diamond in a ring as a gift for his wife in 2005. Then he bought a green diamond and realized that the stones could be used to finance his children’s college education.

“I put some money into that green diamond and that started a collecting bug,” he said. “Then it became trying to find some of the best examples of different colors of vivid colored diamonds.”

Mr. Fine, who sold Sam many of his stones, said some of his pink diamonds had doubled in value in 10 years. But Sam said he also was aware that his timing was right.

In 2007, he bought a half-carat vivid pink diamond in the Argyle tender — an annual private auction of the best pink diamonds from the mine. But this year, he bid four times the price for a smaller pink diamond of lesser quality and lost.

Still, as with any thing of beauty, it can be a lot harder to look rationally at sparkling colored diamonds than a list of company names in a securities portfolio.

Sam said he had amassed a collection valued at $6 million of 41 colored diamonds in almost every different hue but can’t bear to sell them. “Now I keep them securely in a vault and I go down and look at them,” he said. “It’s a lot of concentrated wealth in a thing of great beauty.”",When White Diamonds Won’t Cut It,2015-12-19,"Dealers say wealthy buyers in volatile economies view rare, colored diamonds as a hedge against economic uncertainty.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/your-money/investing-in-colored-diamonds.html

Allstate slumped to its biggest loss in more than five years after reporting a drop in profits that was worse than Wall Street analysts had been expecting. NRG Energy also disappointed investors, reporting a loss, when analysts had been expecting a small profit.

Stocks have been trading in a tight range for several weeks as investors wait to see if the economy strengthens sufficiently for the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than nine years. Investors should not make the mistake, however, of thinking that the market is in a summer slumber, said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at the brokerage firm Edward Jones.

While energy stocks have plunged in response to falling oil prices, she said, health care stocks were having another banner year.

“Stocks haven’t moved anyplace, but it’s because there’s been an equal mix of gainers and losers,” she said. “What we’re seeing is a back-and-forth market, not a doldrums market.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 4.72 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,093.32. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 47.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,550.69. The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.84 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,105.55.

Allstate was among the biggest decliners in the S.&P. 500. The insurer dropped $7.04, or 10 percent, to $62.34 after reporting earnings that fell significantly short of analysts’ expectations. The company said its earnings dropped because of more frequent and more severe auto accidents.

NRG Energy dropped $2.23, or 10 percent, to $20.04.

Apple dropped for a fifth straight day after falling below a closely followed level that traders use to gauge the momentum of a stock. It closed down $3.80 at $114.64 and has dropped 14 percent since closing at a record $133 on Feb. 23. That puts Apple in a correction, Wall Street parlance for price declines of 10 percent or more from a peak.

Almost 80 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 have now reported their second-quarter earnings, and average earnings for companies in the index are set to fall 0.2 percent. If earnings do end the quarter lower, once all companies have reported, it would be the first quarter in almost six years that corporations have failed to increase their profits.

In energy trading, the price of oil rose on Tuesday, partly reversing Monday’s steep drop. United States crude rose 57 cents to close at $45.74 a barrel in New York, regaining some of the $1.95 it lost on Monday. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, rose 47 cents to close at $49.99 in London.

Commodities markets have taken a beating this summer. Oil, coal, coffee, soybeans, copper, iron and nearly every other commodity has fallen sharply in price, upending currency markets and inflicting pain in large parts of the world economy.

But few Americans are complaining. Unless you are trading soybeans or have been focused on the battered shares of companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, or on sinking currencies like the Brazilian real or South African rand, you may not have noticed the commodities debacle.

The collapse in oil prices is all too evident in oil shale states like North Dakota and Oklahoma, as well as in nations like Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Norway and Saudi Arabia — but it has not intruded into the daily experience of many Americans.

For many of us, in fact, the commodities rout hasn’t been perceived as a crisis at all: It has seemed to be welcome news. That is understandable, though that view may be shortsighted.

Consider gasoline, probably the most closely monitored commodity in America, one whose price is posted prominently at filling stations all over the country. Compared with the recent past, gas is still very cheap.

Gas prices typically rise when the summer driving season gets underway, and that pattern held true this year. But over the last three weeks, prices have been dropping again. On Friday the average price of a gallon of regular was only $2.62 — nearly 25 percent below the $3.48 level on the same date last year, the AAA says. But people aren’t rejoicing, AAA surveys suggest. Since 2013, as gas prices have dropped, the common view of a “fair price” has shifted downward, too, said Michael Green, an AAA spokesman. Certainly there is no national movement to raise prices to help gas and oil producers.

Nor are consumers demanding an end to low inflation. The “headline” Consumer Price Index, including energy and food, was virtually flat in the 12 months through June; the “core” number, which excludes those items, rose 1.8 percent over 12 months, the Labor Department said.

Declines in the commodities markets have already had a damping effect on inflation in the United States and are likely to restrain it in future data releases, said Azhar Iqbal, an econometrician with Wells Fargo Securities.

How much of an effect has the decline in the commodities market had on inflation? As a rough guideline, note that the widely followed CRB Commodities index has declined more than 18 percent since May 2014. Every 10 percentage point drop in that index shaves 0.4 percentage point from the annual headline C.P.I. number in America, and a lesser amount, less than 0.1 percentage point, from the core inflation index, Mr. Iqbal’s economic model shows. “The fall in commodity prices has had a measurable effect in the United States,” he said.

The price declines have complicated matters for the Federal Reserve, which has said that after nearly seven years it will begin to raise short-term interest rates from their near-zero level, if data on inflation and unemployment justify the move.

The unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent in July, its lowest level in years, the Labor Department said on Friday. “The low inflation rate, which is connected to commodities, may have induced the Fed to have waited this long to raise interest rates,” said Jay Bryson, a global economist with Wells Fargo Securities. Low interest rates are generally thought to be bullish for the stock market, and while the shares of commodities producers have been hammered, the overall American stock market has undoubtedly been helped by that commodities market effect, he said.

But even if Americans outside the oil patch haven’t been hurt directly, there are important reasons for them to be concerned about the damage in the commodities markets.

“Historically, commodities have been very sensitive indicators of global economic activity,” said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist and strategist. Big declines in the CRB index have typically presaged recessions and bear markets in stocks, he said.

He is not expecting that to happen now partly because the imbalances in commodities markets seem largely to have resulted from miscalculations that led to excess supply. “It’s not that demand is that weak,” he said, which would be more serious. “The problem is mainly with global supplies.”

A significant factor behind the current imbalances is a slowdown in the rate of growth of the Chinese economy — and perceptions of even greater problems in China, set off by the sharp drop in that country’s stock market since late June and by the Chinese government’s intervention in that market, said Michael Pearce, a global economist with Capital Economics in London. “I think some of this is overblown,” he said. “I’m not expecting a hard landing for the Chinese economy. But these perceptions have had powerful effects.”

China is the world’s biggest commodity consumer, HSBC figures show. It accounts for 12.8 percent of all global commodity imports. (The comparable figure for the United States, the second-biggest global consumer, is 10.3 percent.) And these days, when China sneezes, the commodity markets run for cover.

Each country and each commodity has its own story, and many countries are enduring significant pain. For example, in South Africa, a major producer of commodities ranging from platinum and gold to iron and coal, the entire mining industry “is in trouble” because of falling commodity prices, the minister of economic development, Ebrahim Patel, said on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

Currency markets have responded to the changes in the terms of trade, weakening the currencies of commodity producers and strengthening the American dollar. (The Chinese renminbi, which the government keeps in a narrow band linked to the dollar, has strengthened against other currencies, too.) That will make imports to the United States cheaper, and it will make exports more expensive, helping rebalance global supply and demand, Mr. Yardeni said. It can be expected to slow American economic growth and speed up growth in commodity-producing countries that are in dire need of stimulus, he said. “We need to keep our fingers crossed and hope that all works out.”

He added that there was a good chance that it would work out for the United States. Enjoy the quiet and the low prices, by all means, he said. But be aware that unstable and declining global markets can be quite dangerous.",A Cheer and a Half for Cheap Commodities,2015-08-09,"Consumers may welcome lower prices of products like gasoline, but the decline in global commodity markets could be a sign of trouble ahead.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/your-money/a-cheer-and-a-half-for-cheap-commodities.html

Stocks posted losses on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve sent mixed signals on the possibility of an interest rate rise in September. Energy stocks fell as the price of oil plummeted.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 162.61 points, or 0.9 percent, to 17,348.73. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 17.31 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,079.61, and the Nasdaq declined 40.30 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,019.05.

The minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting gave no specific clues on whether its officials were poised to raise interest rates next month. Stocks recovered some of their losses after the release of the Fed minutes, but the modest recovery dissipated and the market ended the day roughly where it was most of the session.

In the minutes, Fed officials appeared to move closer to raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, but remained concerned that the economic slowdown in China could pose risks to the United States economy. Noting the recent sharp decline in commodity prices, policy makers also expressed concern that inflation remained too low to justify an increase in interest rates.

“We don’t come away from the minutes feeling more confident about our call for a September rate hike as we might have hoped,” said Michelle Girard, a senior economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Wednesday. 17,520 Previous close 18,511.34 17,460 17,400 17,340 17,280 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

Bond yields fell sharply as bond traders took the Fed minutes as a sign that interest rates were going to remain at near-zero levels for several more months. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.13 percent, from 2.19 percent on Tuesday.

Most traders said they believed the Fed would either raise interest rates in September or wait until early 2016.

“In their heart of hearts, Fed officials want to raise interest rates this year,” said Alan Rechtschaffen, a portfolio manager of UBS. “But with commodity prices as low as they are, it could give the Fed pause.”

Benchmark United States crude dropped $1.85, to $41.27 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, a standard for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $1.83, to $46.98 a barrel. Oil’s losses deepened after government data showed oil inventories rose much more than expected last week.

Over all, oil prices are down about 50 percent over the last year.

Shares of Marathon Oil fell 7 percent, recovering from a session low that took shares to their lowest prices in six years. Chevron shares lost about 3 percent, ConocoPhillips fell 3.7 percent, and Exxon Mobil declined 2 percent. All reached three- or four-year lows.

Overseas, China’s stock market roiled Asian and European stocks, on fears that the country’s currency, the renminbi, would continue to erode. Chinese stocks ended ahead, but only after a turbulent day that included sharp losses early on. The Shanghai composite index closed up 1.2 percent after plunging as much as 5 percent. European stocks ended the day down roughly 2 percent.

The euro rose to $1.1128, while the dollar was also down against the Japanese yen at 123.77 yen.

1686,"Technology and health care companies led a broad rally on Tuesday that pulled the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index back into black for the year.

The gains erased the market’s losses over the previous two days, when worries over falling prices for oil and other commodities had dragged down stocks. That trend ended on Tuesday when the price of United States crude oil rebounded with a 2.9 percent gain.

Investors also drew encouragement from better-than-expected data on consumer confidence and housing.

“Both of those set us up nicely on a low-volume day to be more positive than negative,” said Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 192.71 points, or 1.1 percent, to 17,720.98. The S.&P. 500 gained 21.86 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,078.36. The Nasdaq composite added 66.95 points, or 1.3 percent, to 5,107.94.

The United States rally accelerated as investors got a look at the latest batch of the country’s economic data. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased from the previous month, reflecting positive views on the economy and job market.

Separately, a crucial gauge of home values indicated that United States home prices climbed 5.5 percent in October from a year earlier. Home values have risen at a pace of about 5 percent during much of 2015 as strong hiring bolstered the real estate market, which is still recovering from a bust that set off a recession eight years ago.

Traders also welcomed a break in the decline in crude oil prices.

Benchmark United States crude rose $1.06, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $37.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, recovering after a slump on Monday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained $1.17, or 3.2 percent, to settle at $37.79 a barrel in London.

Consol Energy and Chesapeake Energy were among the companies to benefit from the rise in energy prices. Shares of Consol gained 37 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $8.24, while Chesapeake jumped 51 cents, or 12.5 percent, to $4.58.

“Lately the markets have been taking their cue from the movement in commodity prices, and in particular, oil,” Mr. Cronk said.

In other energy trading in New York, wholesale gasoline rose 4.3 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $1.276 a gallon; heating oil rose 3.9 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $1.23 a gallon; and natural gas jumped 14.4 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $2.372 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Precious and industrial metals had higher closing prices. Gold rose $7.00 to $1,077.50 an ounce, silver rose 4 cents to $13.93 an ounce and copper gained 6 cents to $2.14 a pound.

Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.31 percent from 2.23 percent late on Monday. The dollar was slightly higher at 120.42 yen, up from 120.34 on Monday. The euro slipped to $1.0933 from $1.0972.

On Tuesday, U.S. stocks ended the day with a slight loss as gains for the energy sector were offset by a slump in utilities. Treasury notes fell for a second day after a report showed that consumer prices rose in Europe for the first time since November, a sign that global inflation is picking up from a low base.

Stocks have been treading water for a month now as a series of modest gains and losses have canceled each other out. The market remains close to record levels after a six-year bull-run, but investors appear reluctant to push prices any further without first seeing evidence that the economy is recovering from its winter slump.

Utilities led declines for stocks as bond yields climbed for a second day.

Last year, investors bought dividend-rich utility stocks as bond yields plunged, but that trend has reversed as bond yields have edged higher in the last four months. The sector has dropped 7.6 percent this year, making it the worst performer among the 10 industry groups that make up the S.&P. 500.

The slump in that sector on Tuesday was offset by a gain in energy stocks, which benefited from higher oil prices.

Oil closed at its highest level since December as the dollar fell against the euro. Oil is priced in dollars, and a drop in the value of the U.S. currency pushes up the price that producers demand for oil.

Despite the recent lack of momentum for stocks, the trend still points for higher prices, said Karyn Cavanaugh, a senior vice president at Voya Investment Management. She believes that stocks will resume their ascent as the economy strengthens and company earnings keep rising.

“The tendency is up, but it’s not always a straight line,” said Ms. Cavanaugh.

Among the day’s biggest winners on Tuesday was PVH, the company behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. The stock jumped after the company reported earnings that beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts. The company also announced that its board had approved a $500 million share buyback program.

Investors were also following developments involving Greece’s fiscal troubles, a day after an emergency meeting of the nation’s international creditors.

Greece has submitted a proposal it hopes will secure a deal to get more funds from its lenders. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said it was now up Europe’s leaders to accept a deal or risk potentially disastrous consequences for the region. For four months, Greece and its creditors have been locked in a standoff over what reforms the country needs to make to get more loans.

In bond trading, prices fell, pushing yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.27 percent from 2.18 percent on Monday. European government bond yields also rose broadly. The yield on the 10-year German government bond rose to 0.72 percent from 0.55 percent, a large move.

The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen. Earlier, it climbed above 125 yen for the first time since 2002. The U.S. currency also weakened against the dollar after the consumer prices report. The currency traded up at $1.1153, from $1.0934 the day before.

In metals trading, gold was little changed at $1,194.40 an ounce. The price of silver rose 12 cents to $16.80 an ounce. Copper climbed 1.6 cents to $2.74 per pound.

The stock market closed out its best week this year with a modest gain on Friday, helped by airlines and industrial companies.

Investors now turn their focus to corporate earnings, which will start to pick up next week.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,084.49. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.46 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,014.89; and the Nasdaq rose 19.68 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,830.47.

The S.&P. 500 ended the week up 3.3 percent, its best week since mid-December. Global markets also had a strong week, with markets in Germany and France rising more than 5 percent. In Asia, markets in Japan, China and Hong Kong are up roughly 4 percent each.

Most of the gains this week came immediately after the release of last week’s disappointing jobs report, which sent a signal to investors that the Federal Reserve would hold off on raising interest rates at least for several more months.

That signal was reinforced on Thursday, when the minutes from the September Fed meeting showed that policy makers were too concerned about low inflation and the slowdown in China to raise interest rates.",Modest Gain for the Market as Banner Week Comes to a Close,2015-10-10,"Airline and industrial stocks rose, but shares of Gap dropped after a disappointing company report.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html

After seven years of keeping United States interest rates at rock bottom, the Federal Reserve has signaled that Dec. 16 could be D-Day for a long-awaited increase. That was the message Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, conveyed in two public presentations last week.

With a 0.25 percent rise in the Fed’s main tool for influencing interest rates a near certainty, investors are already beginning to focus on rate increases that may lie ahead. Will they be gradual, as Ms. Yellen has suggested? Or will economic developments push the Fed to be more aggressive?

Answering these questions requires a crystal ball, which no one has. But they are worth exploring, given the market dislocations that can occur when policy moves take investors by surprise.

Ms. Yellen alluded to this challenge both in her speech on Wednesday and in congressional testimony on Thursday. Waiting too long to raise rates, she said, could force the Fed to “tighten policy relatively abruptly” and risk “disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession.”

A slow and gradual approach to rate increases is what the Fed has telegraphed and is very much what investors expect and desire. But this may not be what they get.

That’s the view of Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Investors who think the Fed’s rate increases will be modest and come over a prolonged period may be incorrectly assessing three elements of the economy, he contends. These errors could be fostering a more negative outlook about economic growth than is justified, reinforcing the view that rate increases will be few and far between.

The first mistake investors are making relates to their excessive fears about the slowdown in domestic manufacturing and the oil industry. While these downturns are genuine and painful — and the spending drop in these arenas have been huge — their negative impact over all is limited, Mr. Shepherdson said.

The entire manufacturing sector generates 12 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product, but the oil sector and related manufacturing accounts for less than 5 percent.

Moreover, the beneficiaries of this collapse far outnumber its victims. “What’s happened over the last 13 months is a giant transfer of resources from oil producers to consumers,” Mr. Shepherdson said. “Consumers are much more important to the U.S. economy, and the very things that have hurt manufacturing and oil have given consumers a great boost.”

The second assumption that investors may be wrong about involves inflation and their belief that a stronger dollar will keep it in check in the United States. Such a situation would help put a lid on rate increases.

A rising dollar certainly makes imported goods less expensive for American buyers. But only 15 percent of the core Consumer Price Index is dollar-sensitive, Mr. Shepherdson said.

Rents make up 41 percent of the index, for example, while 34 percent consists of services, including medical costs, leisure and education. Expenditures on some of these items — especially rents and health care — are rising faster than other prices.

Wage increases pose another wild card on inflation, Mr. Shepherdson said. Labor compensation has grown only modestly in recent years, Ms. Yellen pointed out in her speech, at annual rates of 2 to 2.5 percent. Now that may be changing.

“We have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business sector,” she said.

If inflation heats up, it will represent a big shift. Core inflation is running at 1.25 percent for the 12 months that ended in October, the Fed said, well below its 2 percent inflation objective.

Friday’s healthy jobs report — 211,000 workers hired in November, more than forecast — showed only a modest increase in compensation last month, but it suggested that rising wages may become even more of a factor as the job market continues to tighten. “If nominal wages accelerate, then the Fed’s fervently held belief in gradual rate increases will come under pressure,” Mr. Shepherdson said.

Finally, investors seem convinced that retail sales, a major economic bellwether, are in trouble. This may not be the case.

It’s true that growth in nominal retail sales, those measured in current dollars, is declining. But, Mr. Shepherdson said, if you look at retail sales in real terms, which are not adjusted for price changes, the growth is impressive. In the latter part of 2014, such sales were registering a 4 percent gain. Today, it’s trending at about 5.5 percent, suggesting that the American consumer is better off than many investors think.

If Mr. Shepherdson is right, that means that tens of millions of Americans will be seeing substantial improvement in their own financial well-being. That’s worth celebrating, but it may unnerve many on Wall Street.

Each economic data release has the potential to roil the market if it appears to counter the prevailing view of a more modest recovery. Investors who play down healthy trends in the economy are likely to be caught offsides if the Fed becomes more proactive.

Right now, the market is forecasting only a 50-50 chance of a second rate increase by April. Mr. Shepherdson is predicting such a move in March, as unemployment continues to fall and wage gains pick up further.

By raising rates, the Fed clearly signals its belief that the economy has recovered from the devastation of 2008. That, too, is great news. But the policy shift will also require investors to make a fairly significant attitude adjustment, so don’t be surprised if the ride gets bumpy.",Fed Might Not Have the Luxury of Slow and Steady Rate Increases,2015-12-06,"Despite signals that the Fed will raise rates gradually, three factors could prompt the bank to move more quickly than investors would like, one analyst says.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/business/fed-might-not-have-the-luxury-of-slow-and-steady-rate-increases.html
1717,"U.S. stocks notched their biggest gains in a week Thursday, pushing the Nasdaq index to a new nominal high.

The rally came a day after the Federal Reserve suggested that it wasn’t planning to raise interest rates right away. Ultra-low rates over the past six years have helped drive a bull market in stocks.

“The Fed’s likely to raise rates later this year, but maybe not as aggressively as some market participants worried,” said Michael Baele, managing director and senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Reserve.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 180.10 points, or 1 percent, to 18,115.84. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 20.80 points, or 1 percent, to 2,121.24.

The Nasdaq added 68.07 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at 5,132.95, surpassing the most-recent high for the index of 5,106.59 set May 27. Adjusted for inflation, it would have to climb close to 7,000 to actually set a record.

Most major U.S. stock indexes are up for the year, but the Nasdaq is turning in the best performance. It’s up 8.4 percent this year, compared with a gain of 3 percent for the S.&P. 500 index and 1.6 percent for the Dow.

The Nasdaq’s rise has been driven by technology and health care. In a slow-growth world, investors are favoring stocks where earnings will be better than average. Faster-growing companies should also fare better should rates eventually rise, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital.

While the Nasdaq, which tracks 2,500-plus stocks, has been steadily climbing since 2011, its ascent isn’t the crazed surge that drove it to its dot-com bubble-era highs in 2000. This time the gains are underpinned by solid companies said Stephen Freedman, senior investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.

The average price-earnings ratio of the Nasdaq, a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings the companies in the index generate, is 21. When the Nasdaq was at its highest, the ratio reached 194.

Drug developer BioMarin Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company Radius Health were among the big gainers in the index on Thursday. Both companies reported positive news on treatments still in development. BioMarin vaulted $15.06, or 12.2 percent, to $138.66, while Radius added $7.91, or 15.3 percent, to $59.64.

Investors also welcomed the market debut of fitness-tracking gear company Fitbit on Thursday. The company’s stock jumped $9.68, or 48.4 percent, to $29.68 after pricing its initial public offering at $20 per share.

Traders also got an indication that the economy was recovering from its weak start to the year. An index designed to predict the future health of the economy posted a second straight strong increase in May, indicating the economy should gain strength in the second half of this year.

Despite the upbeat day, investors still haven’t forgotten about Greece.

The debt-stricken nation and its international lenders are deadlocked in bailout talks. Greece needs more loans from its creditors before June 30, when its current bailout program expires and a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) debt repayment is due. Greece and its creditors blame one another for an impasse in the talks. A default could result in Greece leaving the euro currency bloc, dealing a blow to the project.

Bonds edged lower, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up to 2.33 percent from 2.32 percent late Wednesday.

The dollar weakened as traders priced in a lower trajectory for Fed rate increases. The U.S. currency dropped to 122.83 yen from 123.58 yen on Wednesday. The euro strengthened slightly to $1.1404 from $1.1354.

The price of oil rose Thursday as the dollar weakened, making oil more attractive to holders of foreign currencies. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 53 cents to close at $60.45 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oil used by many U.S. refineries, rose 39 cents to close at $64.26 in London.

In metals trading, gold rose $25.20 to $1,202 an ounce. Silver climbed 21 cents to $16.15 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.60 a pound.

1718,"Stocks ended a tumultuous trading week with slight losses Thursday as investors sought safety ahead of an extended holiday weekend.

Investors bought at the opening of trading after a Labor Department report on job creation suggested the economy was improving, though not fast enough to raise the specter of inflation and higher interest rates. But the gains vanished after a downbeat report from the International Monetary Fund on Greece’s finances as the country heads to a vote this weekend on its financial bailout.

It was a quiet end to an eventful week. The markets plunged worldwide on Monday over worries that a Greek default could spread losses throughout the global financial system. A continued drop in Chinese stocks added to the fears, as did a statement from Puerto Rico’s governor that the commonwealth would not be able to pay back its large public debt.

Stocks rose a bit over the next two days, but by Thursday’s close the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was still down 1.2 percent for the week, its biggest weekly loss in three months.

United States markets will be closed Friday in observance of the Independence Day holiday.

The S.&P. 500 slipped Thursday by 0.64 point, less than 0.1 percent, to 2,076.78. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.8 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,730.11. The Nasdaq fell 3.91 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 5,009.21.

“We’ve got Greece, we’ve got China and Puerto Rico,” said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Investors want to take some risk off the table.”

In other data, orders to United States factories fell in May by 1 percent from April, the largest amount in three months, the Commerce Department reported. Much of the weakness reflected a big 35.3 percent fall in demand for commercial aircraft. But even outside the volatile transportation category, orders were up only 0.1 percent.

The lackluster showing suggests that manufacturing is still struggling with challenges like lower energy prices and a strong dollar, which dampen exports.

Investors bought bonds in anticipation that inflation and interest rates will remain low. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose, pushing down its yield to 2.39 percent from 2.43 percent just before the jobs report came out.

“There is no wage pressure and therefore no inflationary pressure. The Fed should just let the economy run,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “Maybe instead of hiking rates in September, maybe it’ll be in December, maybe March.”

Six of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 fell Thursday. Utilities stocks, considered a conservative investment because of their big dividends, rose 1.4 percent.

Among stocks making big moves, Health Net rose $6.51, or 10 percent, to $71.57 after Medicaid coverage provider Centene said it will pay about $6.3 billion to buy the company. The deal is more evidence of managed-care companies looking to bulk up in response to the federal overhaul of health care.

BP shares listed in the United States rose $2.02, or 5 percent, to $41.29 after the oil driller reached an $18.7 billion settlement with several states to resolve litigation over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

Tesla Motors rose $10.87, or 4 percent, to $280.02 after announcing second-quarter deliveries of its electric car surged 52 percent, exceeding 11,000 vehicles to set a company record. The stock has gained 26 percent so far this year despite consistently losing money.

The price of oil erased early gains and closed down slightly after a closely watched count of working drilling rigs had its first increase since December. Benchmark United States crude fell 3 cents Thursday to close at $56.93 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, rose 6 cents to close at $62.07 a barrel in London.

1725,"LONDON — The American chemical company Platform Specialty Products Corporation said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire the British maker of chemicals and materials Alent for 1.35 billion pounds, or about $2.1 billion.

The transaction is expected to increase the breadth and market presence of Platform Specialty’s so-called performance applications business and to complement its MacDermid unit, which produces chemicals for the electronics, automotive, printing and offshore oil drilling industries, Platform Specialty said.

Under the deal, Alent shareholders would receive 503 pence a share in cash, representing a 49 percent premium to Alent’s closing price on Friday.

Shares of Alent rose 46 percent to 492 pence in early trading in London on Monday.

“This business and acquisition fits well within our stated objectives, and we are compelled by the value creation the combination may generate,” Martin E. Franklin, the Platform Specialty chairman, said in a news release. “Alent is a terrific fit and rebalances the portfolio as we continue to build the company.”

The deal values Alent at about $2.3 billion, including debt, the companies said.

In addition to the cash component, Alent shareholders would have the option to receive shares in the combined company for all or part of their holdings in Alent.

Cevian Capital, Alent’s largest shareholder, has agreed to accept shares in the combined company up to the full size of its interest in Alent, which is about 21.9 percent of the company. Cevian has also agreed to vote in favor of the deal.

The amount of shares that Cevian ultimately receives will be determined in part by how many Alent shareholders agree to accept shares, the companies said.

Alent’s board of directors intends to recommend that shareholders approve the transaction, the companies said in a joint release.

“The combination with Platform, drawing on the best of both that Alent and Platform have to offer, is a compelling proposition which I believe will be better able to serve customers and provide even greater opportunities for our employees,” Andrew Heath, the Alent chief executive, said in a news release.

Platform Specialty said it expected to achieve at least $50 million in annual cost savings in the three years after the transaction.

Alent was formed in 2012 after it was spun out of the engineering group Cookson. Alent manufactures specialty chemicals and other materials for the electronics, automotive and industrial sectors, including soldering materials.

The company posted revenue of £644.8 million in 2014, about 43 percent of which came from the United States.

Platform Specialty, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., manufactures specialty chemicals for a variety of industries, including the agricultural, electronics, graphic arts and offshore oil production sectors. It posted sales of $843.2 million in 2014.

The company would continue to be based in the United States.

Oil dropped as a report showed that OPEC members were keeping up production even after a big drop in prices. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $2.53 to close at $47.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell $2.79 to $49.86 a barrel in London.

The slide in crude prices since last year is having a big impact on corporate earnings.

Over all, earnings are forecast to slide by 5.3 percent, compared with the same period last year. But much of that decline is due to a big slump in energy company profits. Earnings in the energy sector are forecast to slide by 66 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ.

Still, some analysts are confident that the outlook for companies will improve next year, as demand revives overseas and improving consumer confidence boosts the U.S. economy.

“This earnings season will be a confirmation process. Yes, we have low inflation and yes, we are growing very moderately, but fairly dependably,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “It will be O.K., it won’t be great, but I think we can look forward to better earnings growth in 2016.”

Gains were also muted as the stock market was coming off its biggest week of the year.

Most of the advance came after a disappointing jobs report which suggested the Federal Reserve could postpone a long-anticipated interest rate rise for several months. That thought was reinforced Thursday, when the minutes from the September Fed meeting showed policy makers were too concerned about low inflation and the slowdown in China to raise interest rates.

Low rates can help boost stocks by reducing returns on fixed-income investments such as bonds. They also make it easier for companies to borrow in the bond markets, giving them funds to buy back their own stock.

On Monday, drugmaker Eli Lilly was among the day’s biggest losers. The stock dropped after it said it was halting development of evacetrapib, a drug that was intended to treat patients with high-risk heart disease. The stock fell $6.70, or 7.1 percent, to $79.44.

Data storage company EMC was a winner. The stock climbed 51 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $28.37 after Dell said it was acquiring the company in a deal valued at about $67 billion. Since going private in 2013, Dell has been investing in research and development and expanding its software and services business.

1733,"The ratings agency Fitch downgraded the Chesapeake Energy Corporation’s issuer default rating last week to BB- from BB. At the same time, Fitch upgraded the rating on the company’s bank loan to BB+ from BB.

The downgrade is easily explained, given that the energy industry has been rocked by a steep slide in oil and natural gas prices. In announcing the downgrade, Fitch said the move reflected its “expectation that Chesapeake’s cash flow, liquidity, and leverage profiles will be notably weaker than previously forecast due to persistently low oil and gas price realizations and heightened future reliance on asset sales to fund cash flow gaps.”

But what about the upgrade in the bank loan? That seems a bit confusing. How can one company be downgraded and upgraded at the same time?

The credit line was first obtained less than a year ago, when Chesapeake announced it as “a new five-year, $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility.” But in late September, the unsecured loan became a secured loan.

That bumped the loan up to a higher priority in the capital structure, meaning that the bank lenders will get paid before Chesapeake’s bondholders in the event of a bankruptcy or other restructuring of the company’s debt. That explains Fitch’s decision to upgrade this specific piece of debt, while at the same time downgrading the broader company.

In a report issued this week, Fitch noted that senior secured loans have an average return in bankruptcy of 80 percent, which of course means that many loans offer a much better return than that. It is the reality of modern corporate finance that distressed companies often enter bankruptcy with all of their assets pledged to senior lenders, who then tend to do quite well in the bankruptcy case, while unsecured creditors barely obtain anything.

Let’s be clear: There is no indication that Chesapeake is headed for bankruptcy. And I’m sure Chesapeake’s communications department would like to underline that several times.

Instead, Fitch’s rating actions simply illustrate how it happens that many companies enter bankruptcy with the capital structures we now see; it is the result of a structural change that happens well before bankruptcy is ever mentioned.

And Fitch’s simultaneous moves to both raise and lower the credit ratings illustrate how much this is something of a zero-sum game. The liquidity a borrower gets from its bank lenders comes at the cost of greater risk to the junior creditors.",How a Company Can Be Both Downgraded and Upgraded,2015-11-13,A recent ratings action by Fitch illustrates why many companies can enter bankruptcy with certain capital structures.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/business/dealbook/how-a-company-can-be-both-downgraded-and-upgraded.html

1735,"The price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, briefly fell below $40 a barrel. Later on Friday it was trading at $40.11, nearly 25 percent below its price at the start of the year. The decline in the price of oil and other commodities may indicate that there is less demand for such commodities because economies are slowing. The fall in oil reduces energy bills for consumers and companies, but it also hammers the profitability of the many oil and gas companies that have invested heavily during the recent shale boom.

The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, spiked higher than the level it reached last fall, when global markets last sold off on concerns about global growth.

Investors rushed into the relative safety of government bonds. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.05 percent on Friday, from 2.07 percent on Thursday.

In the coming days, investors will have to decide whether the selling is part of summer squall that will soon pass — or the start of tougher times for the global economy that could weigh on stock markets for months.

“There is a relatively more ominous slowdown going on in emerging markets — and that’s what the trade is all about right now,” said Gina C. Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.

Officials at the Fed will also have to weigh the seriousness of the turbulence in the markets as they decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years. Raising rates as early as next month, as some investors have expected will happen, could further unnerve investors, damp economic activity and speed the flow of dollars out of developing countries. As a result, the Fed may decide to wait until later in the year, or longer. The central bank may try to estimate the impact of a falling stock market on the wealth and spending habits of United States households. The six-year bull run, which began as the last bear market ended in 2009, has helped drive up households’ holdings of stocks and mutual funds by over $10 trillion.

Much, of course, depends on the strength of the Chinese economy — and an economic release on Friday could stoke further pessimism. Output in China’s manufacturing industry contracted in the first three weeks of August at the fastest pace since the depths of the financial crisis, according to a preliminary reading of the Caixin purchasing managers’ index. It came in at 47.1 points for August, compared with 47.8 points in July. The August figure was its lowest reading since March 2009 on a scale in which any figure below 50 indicates contraction.

Markets have grown volatile since China made a surprise move last week to devalue its currency, the renminbi, by the biggest amount since 1994. On Thursday, Vietnam devalued its currency, the dong, while Kazakhstan allowed its currency, the tenge, to float freely, prompting a decline of about 25 percent.

Since the devaluation, China has moved to keep the renminbi from depreciating further by selling dollars. This effectively takes money out of the financial system, so the central bank has been busy this week trying to add liquidity. On Wednesday, it announced 110 billion renminbi ($17 billion) in new six-month loans to 14 unnamed financial institutions.

These measures have not been enough, as China’s overnight money market rates have continued to inch upward. Many analysts now think the central bank must respond more aggressively.

The main Shanghai index fell 4.3 percent, while the Shenzhen index closed 5.4 percent lower. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined 1.5 percent after having given up all its gains for the year this week. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo closed down 3 percent.

European shares were also trading lower on Friday. Benchmark indexes in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Milan were all down about 3 percent, capping a week of declines.

Positive survey data published on Friday was not enough to overcome investor doubts about whether the Continent could break out of its pattern of perennially sluggish growth, analysts said.

A monthly survey of business sentiment by Markit, a research firm, signaled a modest pickup in eurozone growth. But the survey also pointed to nearly stagnant growth in France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy after Germany.

Another headwind for United States stocks is that their valuations — or the yardsticks that investors use to determine whether a company is cheap or expensive — recently climbed to demandingly high levels. This can make stocks more vulnerable to declines when bad news occurs or fearfulness grows among investors.

Companies are struggling to bolster their revenue, for instance.

American markets have been erratic for weeks because of concerns that China’s economy is slowing more rapidly than previously thought, but investors have also had to contend with uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates in the United States.

Investors had been hoping that the government’s August jobs report would give them more clarity before a pivotal Federal Reserve Board meeting later this month. However, a mixed report left many guessing as to whether policy makers would feel confident enough about the strength of the United States economy to raise interest rates from record lows.

The report showed that the American unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low in August, but also that employers added fewer jobs than expected.

“It’s interesting and disappointing that today’s data didn’t provide us with that ‘ah-ha!’ clarity that everyone is seeking,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.

“There’s a lot of trepidation in the market over what the Fed will do, and it’s only getting worse as we get closer to the meeting,” said Kristina Hooper, head of investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors. The two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee begins Sept. 16.

The Dow Jones industrial average added 23.38 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,374.76. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 2.27 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,951.13, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 16.48 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,733.50.

Stocks started Thursday solidly higher, but momentum waned as the day progressed. Major indexes dipped briefly into the red by midafternoon before ending mostly higher.

Investors were initially encouraged by news from the European Central Bank, whose president, Mario Draghi, said was prepared to give the eurozone a bigger dose of stimulus if inflation across the 19-country bloc did not pick up.

Along with keeping interest rates low, the central bank is pumping 60 billion euros a month into the region’s economy by buying government and corporate bonds. The program is to run at least through September 2016.

“Draghi said in 2012 he would do whatever it takes to grow the eurozone economy, and he’s holding to that promise,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.

European markets jumped on the news. Germany’s DAX closed up 2.7 percent, France’s CAC-40 rose 2.2 percent and U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 1.8 percent.

The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates in the United States for the first time since the financial crisis. While chances of a rate increase in September have diminished because of signs of weakening global growth and a sell-off in Chinese stocks, many contend the growing United States economy may be ready to withstand higher interest rates.

Friday’s jobs report for August, an important gauge of how the United States economy is doing, could play a big role in guiding the Fed’s decision. Economists are forecasting that employers created 220,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent.

The price of oil followed the stock market higher. United States crude rose 50 cents to close at $46.75 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many refineries in the United States, rose 18 cents to close at $50.68 a barrel in London.

In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 1.2 cents to close at $1.437 a gallon; heating oil rose a penny to close at $1.619 a gallon; and natural gas rose 7.7 cents to close at $2.725 per 1,000 cubic feet.

United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.16 percent from 2.19 percent.

1762,"Stocks paused on Tuesday, closing moderately lower after five straight days of gains.

DuPont and energy shares rose sharply, but the overall market was weighed down by health care stocks, especially biotechnology companies.

Investors appear to be in standby mode, with the closely watched minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September meeting set to come out on Thursday and third-quarter company earnings just around the corner.

The Dow Jones industrial average added 13.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,790.19. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 7.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,979.92 and the Nasdaq lost 32.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,748.36.

The biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500 and Dow was the chemical giant DuPont, whose shares rose $3.93, or nearly 8 percent, to $55.21. On Monday, DuPont’s chief executive, Ellen Kullman, said she would retire on Oct. 16. DuPont’s profits have lagged in recent years, and the company has been a target of activist investors like Nelson Peltz.

Biotechnology stocks were hit hard. The Nasdaq biotechnology index fell nearly 4 percent after the recently announced 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal provided only eight years of certain kinds of drug patent protection, less than the 12 years the industry had sought.

Biotech stocks have plummeted in recent months because of investor concerns that the industry could face more scrutiny from Washington over its drug pricing practices. The index is down 24 percent from its peak in July.

Barring some geopolitical crisis or shocking company news, the next major move for the market will most likely come Thursday, when investors get the minutes from the Fed’s policy meeting in September.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Tuesday. 16,880 16,840 16,800 17,760 Previous close 16,776.43 16,720 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

Securities that allow investors to bet on which way the Fed will move interest rates now show the market expects the next rate increase will come in March 2016. The minutes, which break down the issues the Fed addressed, should provide clues on whether policy makers still feel confident about raising interest rates.

“We need to see if they had signs that last week’s bad jobs report was coming, and decided to hold off on raising rates then, or if they are still set on moving this year,” said J. J. Kinahan of TD Ameritrade.

In energy markets, oil rose after the Energy Department said American crude production declined by 120,000 barrels a day in September versus August. The agency also expects production to decline from an average of 9.2 million barrels a day this year to 8.9 million barrels in 2016.

American benchmark crude jumped $2.27 to settle at $48.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That helped send oil and gas companies sharply higher. ConocoPhillips, Chevron and ExxonMobil rose between 2 and 4 percent each.

Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many United States refineries, rose $2.67 to $51.92 a barrel in London.

In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 5.1 cents to $1.436 a gallon; heating oil rose 6.3 cents to $1.612 a gallon; and natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.47 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Chinese stocks plunged 7 percent as fears spread that a yearlong bull rally there has become overheated. China’s benchmark index is still up more than double over the past year.

The Dow Jones industrial average added 56.32 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,946.68. It was largely lifted by Nike, which rose more than 4 percent after posting strong quarterly results.

As they have done all week, global investors were watching closely as Greek debt talks go down to the wire.

Early on Saturday in Europe, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, called for a referendum on July 5 so that citizens could decide whether to accept or reject the terms of a bailout deal proposed by the country’s creditors.

Greece needs a deal in order to make a debt payment of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday. Failing to do so would put the country on a path toward default.

“While these deadlines can quite often be taken with a pinch of salt, Greece has literally run out of time on this occasion,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Investors now turn to next week, when the United States government will release the June jobs report. Economists forecast that American employers created 237,500 jobs last month, according to FactSet.

There has been a lot of focus on when the Federal Reserve will raise its key interest rate. Recent economic data seems to show that the economic recovery in the United States is holding steady, and many investors are expecting the Fed to raise rates in September.

“There’s a premium on economic data right now,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Outside of Greece, everyone will be focused on how the U.S. economy is holding up.”

While Greece has been the main driver in financial markets in recent weeks, worries over China have risen higher on the list of concerns.

On Friday, Chinese stocks plunged more than 7 percent. The Shanghai composite closed at 4,192.87. It reached 5,300 just two weeks ago.

“Although I continue to be optimistic about the longer-term trend” of China’s markets, said Bernard Aw of IG Markets in Singapore, “it’s clear that we are in a sharp correction phase.”

In energy trading, the price of oil was nearly flat Friday. It finished the week little changed, and remained in a narrow range for the ninth straight week. Benchmark United States crude fell 7 cents to settle at $59.63 a barrel in New York.

Oil finished last week at $59.61, and it has traded roughly between $57 and $61 since late April. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many United States refineries, rose 6 cents to $63.26 a barrel in London.

In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 1.2 cents to $2.049 a gallon. Heating oil rose 0.01 cents to close at $1.863 a gallon and natural gas fell 7.7 cents to $2.773 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $1.40 to $1,172.90 an ounce.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, a victim of the turmoil in mainland Chinese markets, also lost 6 percent. Beijing ordered state-owned companies to buy shares and promised more credit to finance trading.

The Shanghai index has lost almost a third of its value in the last month. It is still up 70 percent over the past year.

In Europe, Greece applied for a new three-year loan and said it would have a new proposal for creditors in coming days.

1773,"Stocks edged higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve reassured investors that it was in no rush to raise interest rates from historically low levels.

The central bank said that the economy was strengthening, but not enough for policy makers to signal an imminent increase in rates. The Fed’s benchmark rate has remained near zero for more than six years in an effort to bolster the economy and encourage borrowing, lending and investment.

Surging stocks and low interest rates have gone hand-in-hand over the past six years, pushing the market to highs. Investors worry that, should the Fed raise rates too quickly, it could stifle growth.

“This makes the market feel more confident,” said Alan Rechtschaffen, a financial adviser at UBS Wealth Management Americas. “What the Fed is telling you is that they’re in no rush to raise interest rates right now.”

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 31.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,935.74. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 4.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,100.44. The Nasdaq rose 9.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,064.88.

Bond prices rose after the Fed released its statement, reversing an earlier sell-off. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.32 percent from 2.38 percent before the statement was released.

Eight of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 index ended the day higher, with utilities leading the gains. The sector rose 0.9 percent but is still down 9.7 percent this year.

The major stock indexes remain close to highs set in May but have sagged in the past month. The Dow is up 0.6 percent this year despite dropping 2 percent from its last record close on May 19. The S.&P. is up 2 percent for the year and off 1.4 percent from its high on May 21. The Nasdaq is faring the best.

Aside from the Fed, investors were also keeping an eye on negotiation between Greece and its lenders.

Greece remained deadlocked in talks with its creditors on Wednesday, and there was little sign of a breakthrough a day ahead of a meeting of the 19 finance ministers from countries that use the euro.

Greece needs to get more loans before the end of the month, when its bailout program expires and it is scheduled to make a big payment to the International Monetary Fund.

European markets have slumped in the last month as the talks have failed to produce an agreement. Greek markets are suffering the most. Greece’s benchmark index sank 3 percent on Wednesday and was down 18 percent this year.

Yields on Greek government bonds have surged as investors’ confidence in the country’s ability to pay its debt has waned. The yield on the Greek 10-year government bond has climbed to 13 percent from 6 percent a year ago.

In the United States, investors welcomed the latest round of corporate deals.

Shares in Kythera Biopharmaceuticals surged 22.1 percent on news that Allergan, the maker of Botox, has agreed to buy Kythera, a California drug maker, for about $2.1 billion.

Stock in Allergan added 77 cents to $298.79.

Shares of the medical technology company Hill-Rom Holdings climbed 6.3 percent after it agreed to buy Welch Allyn, a privately held rival, for about $2.05 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. The stock gained $3.32 to $55.70.

Shares of FedEx fell 3 percent after its latest quarterly results missed Wall Street’s expectations. The company said lower fuel surcharges and the strong dollar cut into revenue. FedEx reported a loss of $895 million, or $3.16 a share.

1775,"I started my career as a foreign correspondent in Beirut in 1979. I didn’t know it at the time, but 1979 turned out to be one of the great vintage years for foreign news — particularly from the Middle East. It set in motion the most important dynamics still shaping that region today. In fact, it’s been 1979 for 36 years. And the big question about the Iran nuclear deal reached this month is, Will it ultimately be a break from the history set in motion in 1979, and put the region on a new path, or will it turbocharge 1979 in ways that could shake the whole world?

What happened in 1979? For starters, there was the takeover of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists who challenged the religious credentials of the Saudi ruling family, accusing them of impiety. The al-Sauds responded by forging a new bargain with their religious conservatives: Let us stay in power and we’ll give you a freer hand in setting social norms, relations between the sexes and religious education inside Saudi Arabia — and vast resources to spread the puritanical, anti-women, anti-Shiite, anti-pluralistic Sunni Wahhabi fundamentalism to mosques and schools around the world.

This Saudi lurch backward coincided with Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, which brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power. That revolution set up a global competition between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia for leadership of the Muslim world, and it also led to a big surge in oil prices that gave both regimes more money than ever to export Shiite and Sunni fundamentalism. That is why the Egyptian scholar Mamoun Fandy liked to say, “Islam lost its brakes in 1979.”

That competition was further fueled by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 — which spawned the Sunni jihadist movement and eventually Al Qaeda — and by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, also in 1979, which basically ended all new building of nuclear power plants in America, making us more dependent on fossil fuels. Of course, the Islamic Revolution in Iran also led to a break in relations with the U.S. — and shifted Iran from a tacit ally of Israel’s to a country wishing “death to Israel.”

So the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal marks a big change — but because it will lead to an end to economic sanctions on Iran, it could turbocharge 1979 as easily as end it. That depends on a lot of factors: Will the nuclear deal empower the more moderate/pragmatic majority inside Iran rather than the hard-line Revolutionary Guards Corps? The reason to be worried is that the moderates don’t control Iran’s nuclear program or its military/intelligence complex; the hard-line minority does. The reason to be hopeful is the majority’s aspiration to reintegrate with the world forced the hard-liners to grudgingly accept this deal.

A lot will depend also on Saudi Arabia moderating the anti-modernist trend it imposed on Sunni Islam. On Tuesday the Middle East Media Research Institute released a translation of a TV interview by the Saudi author Turki al-Hamad about the extremist discourse prevalent in Saudi Arabia. “Who serves as fuel for ISIS?” he asked. “Our own youth. What drives our youth to join ISIS? The prevailing culture, the culture that is planted in people’s minds. It is our youth who carry out bombings. … You can see (in ISIS videos) the volunteers in Syria ripping up their Saudi passports.”

That’s why another factor determining if 2015 is a break with 1979 or a multiplier of it will be the energy revolution in America — efficiency, renewables and fracking — and whether it keeps putting downward pressure on oil prices. Give me five years of $25-a-barrel oil and you’ll see reformers strengthened in Iran and Saudi Arabia; they’ll both have to tap their people instead of oil.

But while that oil price decline is necessary, it is not sufficient. Both regimes also have to stop looking for dignity and legitimacy in combating the other — and Israel — and find it, instead, in elevating their own people. Saudi Arabia’s attempt to bomb Iranian influence out of Yemen is sheer madness; the Saudis are bombing rubble into rubble. Will Iran spend its windfall from this nuclear deal trying to dominate the Arab world? Maybe. But Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen today are like a giant Superfund toxic cleanup site. Iran wants to own that? It will sap more of its strength than strengthen it. We know.

On July 9, Agence France-Presse reported that the International Monetary Fund estimated Saudi Arabia, whose population tripled since 1975, would run a budget deficit this year exceeding “$130 billion, the largest in the kingdom’s history,” and “to finance spending Riyadh has already withdrawn $52.3 billion from its fiscal reserves in the first five months of the year.” Iran’s population has doubled since 1979, and 60 percent of its residents are under 30 and it has 20 percent unemployment. Last April, Issa Kalantari, a former Iranian agriculture minister, warned that because of dwindling water resources, and over-exploitation, if Iran doesn’t radically change its water usage “50 million people — 70 percent of Iranians — will have no choice but to leave the country,” Al-Monitor reported.

Nukes are hardly the only threats for this region. Both Iran and Saudi Arabia desperately need to make 2015 the end of the 1979 era. It would be fanciful to predict that they will — and utterly realistic to predict the destruction that will visit both if they don’t.","For the Mideast, It’s Still 1979",2015-07-29,"Events 36 years ago still shape the region, but that could change.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/opinion/thomas-friedman-for-the-mideast-its-still-1979.html

1780,"Encouraging news from overseas pushed the United States market higher on Thursday, helping stocks recover some of the ground they lost a day earlier.

In China, frantic efforts by the authorities to stop a monthlong rout in the country’s stock market met with some success. The Shanghai composite surged after opening sharply lower. United States investors have become concerned that the sell-off in China, the world’s second-biggest economy, would start to hurt growth there.

In Europe, stocks soared on speculation that last-ditch talks between Greece and its creditors would produce an agreement, preventing a possible default by Athens on its debt. Those problems, and the fear that they could hurt the global economy, have pushed down the United States stock market in recent weeks.

“We’re cautioning investors not to get too concerned,” said Alec Young, an investment strategist at Oppenheimer Funds. “There’s been a lot of noise recently, but when we really look into it, none of it, at this point, is leading us to a very negative view” of stocks.

In the United States, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 4.63 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,051.31. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 33.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,548.62. The Nasdaq rose 12.64 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,922.40.

Gains in the United States on Thursday were also held back by losses for utility companies. The dividend-rich stocks surged last year as investors looked for income as bond yields fell. However, a rise in yields since January has made utility stocks seem less attractive.

On Thursday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 2.32 percent from 2.20 percent a day earlier, a big move, as investors sold the safest assets. The yield on the 10-year note was as low as 1.64 percent at the end of January.

Walgreens Boots Alliance logged the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500. The company, the owner of Walgreens and Duane Reade drugstores, surged after reporting quarterly earnings that beat expectations. The company also raised its outlook for the year. Its stock climbed $3.64, or 4.2 percent, to $89.55.

Walgreens named Stefano Pessina as its chief. Mr. Pessina, 73, led Alliance Boots as executive chairman before engineering the combination with Walgreens.

Also Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of people filing applications for unemployment benefits rose by 15,000, to 297,000. It was the highest weekly total since 327,000 applications were filed in the week of Feb. 28.

Analysts said the increase was probably more the result of temporary auto plant shutdowns than any underlying labor market weakness. And even with the recent increases, benefit applications, which are a proxy for layoffs, remain at levels that reflect a labor market that has been posting solid employment gains.

The four-week average for claims, which smooths out some of the volatility, rose to 279,500, up slightly from 275,000 the previous week.

In energy trading, the price of oil rose for the first time in six trading sessions as the Chinese stock market steadied, easing fears that the economy there would slow significantly and reduce demand for oil.

Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many United States refineries, rose $1.56 to close at $58.61 in London.

1792,"Do you remember when Henry Blodget first became famous?

No, it wasn’t when the then-New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, unearthed those notorious emails Blodget wrote as Merrill Lynch’s Internet analyst, the ones in which he privately disparaged companies he was publicly touting. That came later.

It was 1998, the height of the Internet bubble. Blodget was then an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, and the “it” stock of the moment was Amazon, which had as many detractors as it had boosters.

One day that December, with the stock at about $240 a share — and with no change in Amazon’s fundamentals — Blodget, an Amazon bull, raised his price target to $400. That day it popped more than $45; within three weeks it hit Blodget’s target. Some months later, I wrote an article about his coverage of Internet companies. It was titled “The Cheerleader.”

During the current six-year bull-market — a market that has also seen its share of excess — a new “it” stock has emerged: Tesla Motors. Led by the charismatic Elon Musk, Tesla is a company that makes beautiful, and thus far very expensive, all-electric cars, vehicles that are so fantastically well made that Consumer Reports just gave the Model S P85D sedan its highest rating ever.

Tesla is also, however, a company that eats through cash, loses money on every sedan it sells, routinely overpromises what it will deliver to Wall Street and is regularly in need of new funding.

That’s not to mention other factors impinging on Tesla: the falling price of oil, for instance, which diminishes demand for electric cars, or the fact that a number of traditional luxury auto brands are poised to get into the electric vehicle game. It’s not hard to make a case that, at around $250 a share, Tesla is as insanely overvalued as any Internet stock in the late 1990s.

And guess what? Just like the Internet stocks of yore, Tesla has its own Wall Street cheerleader: Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley’s auto analyst. Jonas could not be less interested in mundane factors like earnings per share; indeed, he has had to lower his 2015 earnings estimates several times; he now predicts the company will lose $2.70 a share. But never mind: In the future that he envisions, Tesla will be the most important car company on earth.

Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Jonas raised his share price target for Tesla from $280 to $465, which would make Tesla more valuable than General Motors or Ford. Had anything fundamental changed for Tesla? Of course not!

Jonas based his new target on something he labeled Tesla Mobility, which he describes as “an app based, on-demand mobility service.” Where did he learn about Tesla Mobility? Who knows? Tesla, a company hardly averse to hype, has never acknowledged its existence.

And that’s not the worst of it. No, the worst is the timing of his call. It came days after Tesla announced that it would be issuing stock to raise yet more money — and that Morgan Stanley was among the underwriters. (The company raised close to $800 million.)

Although Morgan Stanley insists that Jonas was in the process of changing his price target well before the equity offering — and that the Chinese wall between the firm’s analysts and its investment bankers is unbreachable — his call had to be pleasing to the underwriters. Doug Kass, the well-known market commentator, told me that Jonas’s call was “somewhere between tone deaf and borderline illegal.” In a note to his readers, he added that it was “a further reason why Wall Street is not trusted.”

One reason people like Kass have taken special notice of the timing of Jonas’s new price target is that this isn’t even the first time Jonas has changed his target at, shall we say, a fortuitous moment.

Back in February 2014, right around the time that Morgan Stanley was involved in a big convertible bond offering for Tesla, Jonas raised his price target from $153 a share to $320 a share. Again, his convenient “epiphany” — as Kass puts it — had nothing to do with Tesla’s fundamentals. That time he claimed Tesla could disrupt the auto industry by manufacturing its own batteries and making advances in autonomous driving. Well, maybe.

Jonas has hardly been the only reason Tesla’s stock remains in the stratosphere, but he is unquestionably helping to drive the stock up. And to be fair, however convenient his calls have been for Morgan Stanley’s investment bankers and customers, he believes what he is writing. Although the firm would not allow me to interview him on the record, it is clear from reading his reports that he believes in his heart that as driving becomes more autonomous and more about batteries than about gasoline, Tesla will be the big winner.

1796,"The trading tactic known as “spoofing” is again under scrutiny, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accusing a Chicago-based trader of a “pattern of manipulative and deceptive spoofing” for three years from December 2011 to January 2014 in various futures contracts.

The case, filed on Monday in the Federal District Court in Chicago, is the regulator’s fourth spoofing case since new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act sought to abolish the practice. The C.F.T.C. says that the trader, Igor Oystacher, and his firm 3 Red Trading L.L.C., engaged in spoofing in futures contracts for copper, crude oil, natural gas, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 E-mini, among others.

In spoofing, a trader tries to trick others into believing there are large orders for futures contracts in order to draw them into the market. What the trader has actually done is place large orders for futures intending to cancel them, artificially driving prices up or down in a way that creates an opening for the trader to profit off tiny price differences.

In Mr. Oystacher’s case, the agency contends that he placed large orders to either buy or sell futures through 3 Red at the same or worse price than the current best bid or offer.

Then he canceled those orders while simultaneously placing big orders for the same futures at or above the current best bid or offer.

The strategy enabled Mr. Oystacher to buy or sell futures in quantities and at prices that would not otherwise have been available, the C.F.T.C. said.

Greg O’Connor, 3 Red’s chief compliance officer, said in an emailed statement: “The charges are completely without merit. The C.F.T.C. has oversimplified complex trading and is now trying to classify legitimate trading and risk management as a market infraction. We stand behind the trading at issue as it does not contradict available guidance nor violate the law.”

He added that 3 Red cooperated with the agency over a four-year review of its trading.



Spoofing creates the illusion of false market depth.

“Spoofing seriously threatens the integrity and stability of futures markets because it discourages legitimate market participants from trading,” said Aitan Goelman, the C.F.T.C.’s director of enforcement.

The trick will be in proving intent. Order cancellations are a common occurrence in the securities markets as the use of algorithms and other computer-driven trading strategies, including high-frequency trading, transformed the way markets operate over the last decade.

This month, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a $1 million settlement in a spoofing investigation of its own. The securities regulator had accused the New York-based proprietary trading firm Briargate Trading and its co-founder, Eric Oscher, of spoofing securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.",C.F.T.C.

1799,"PARIS — I had low expectations for the U.N. climate meeting here and it met all of them — beautifully. I say that without cynicism.

Any global conference that includes so many countries can’t be expected to agree on much more than the lowest common denominator. But the fact that the lowest common denominator is now so high — a willingness by 188 countries to offer plans to steadily and verifiably reduce their carbon emissions — means we still have a chance to meet what scientists say is our key challenge: to avoid the worst impacts of global warming that we cannot possibly manage and to manage those impacts that we can no longer avoid. That is a big, big deal.

Many leaders had a hand in it, but it would not have happened without the diplomacy of President Obama and John Kerry.

Hat’s off, because this keeps alive the hope of capping the earth’s warming to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit, above the level that existed at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution — the rough redline scientists have drawn beyond which “global weirding” will set in and the weather will most likely get really weird and unstable. We’re already almost halfway to passing that redline.

The only important holdout in the world to this deal is the U.S. Republican Party. I wouldn’t care about such cave men — as one sign borne by a Paris demonstrator said, “Dinosaurs didn’t believe in climate change either,” and it didn’t end well for them — except that one of these knuckleheads could be our next president and mess this up.

The G.O.P. should take the wise counsel of Andy Karsner, who was George W. Bush’s assistant energy secretary and one of his climate negotiators, and use the Paris deal to build a bridge back to constructive engagement on the subject. The G.O.P. can plausibly argue, said Karsner, that it was Bush who, in 2007, created the “major economies” strategy to address climate change through precisely the kind of market-enabled, voluntary national targets adopted in Paris.

“The price of getting this issue behind us may never again be this cheap,” Karsner said of the G.O.P. “Congressional leaders need to evaluate the opportunity they have to reconnect with mainstream voters, scientific, civic and business leaders, geopolitical strategists and most anyone under 35 years old who’s completed eighth-grade science.”

With the earth on pace to add two billion more people by 2050, who will all want cars and homes, and with scientists saying the only way to stay below the 2 degrees C redline is to phase out all fossil fuels by roughly the same date, there is only one force big enough to do that — to take on Mother Nature at scale — and that’s Father Greed, a.k.a., the market.

What will make this deal epochal is if the U.S. and China now lead the world in imposing a price on carbon, because only that will take to scale the already significant technology breakthroughs that have happened with wind, solar, batteries, energy efficiency and nuclear power.

“In the last six years,” said Hal Harvey, C.E.O. of Energy Innovation, a policy research group, “solar prices have dropped by more than 80 percent, and now cost less than a new coal plant. Wind is down 60 percent, and LED lights more than 90 percent.” With other new technologies near at hand “it becomes clear that a clean future costs no more than a dirty one,” he said. “Texas now has the most wind installed of any U.S. state. Texas!”

Harvey’s team has built a computer model to see which policies can decarbonize the economy at the lowest price. It lets a user test varying policy options on climate, pollution and the economy. If you pick the right blend, the results will have you grinning. Go online, at www.energypolicy.solutions, and try it for yourself.

The point, said Harvey, is that today’s chief executive doesn’t “have to be a hero anymore” to invest in clean power.

Indeed, José Manuel Entrecanales, chairman of Acciona, the giant Spanish renewables company, told me that he used to be sprinting alone in the race to install renewables “with the wind in my face.” But now he finds the wind is at his back, and some of the biggest oil companies are trying to muscle into the race. That is not an accident, he said, considering that recent deals from Morocco to South Africa to Chile were struck for around 2.8 cents a kilowatt-hour of wind and 4.2 cents a kW-h for solar, making them highly competitive with fossil fuel.

“In Chile,” said Entrecanales, “there was [just] an auction which was technology agnostic, so the government was offering big bunches of energy to be supplied over the next 10 years, 20 years, and all the energy awarded was renewable. Not one single megawatt hour of conventional energy was supplied.”

But, he stressed, leveraging the Paris consensus to get a price on carbon in the big emitting countries is the “Holy Grail,” the thing that tips everything. Because while renewables can win against new fossil fuel plants, old fossil fuel plants built without any pollution control, and with all their capital expense amortized and still enjoying subsidies, can still run very cheaply — if you don’t count their massive carbon impacts.

A price on carbon, said Entrecanales, “would drive technology, it would drive R&D, it would drive investment, it would drive consumer habits.” So Paris was necessary. A price on carbon will make it sufficient.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1803,"Exxon Mobil agreed on Thursday to buy InterOil, a driller focused on projects in Papua New Guinea, for at least $2.5 billion as the petroleum giant seeks newer fields.

Exxon beat out a competing bid by Oil Search Limited, a Papua New Guinea oil and gas exploration and development company, which had offered to pay about $2.2 billion.

InterOil’s holdings in Papua New Guinea are a potential source for liquefied natural gas. The deal includes interests in six licenses in Papua New Guinea covering about four million acres, including a field called Elk-Antelope where the proposed liquefied natural gas project would be anchored.

Chris Finlayson, the chairman of InterOil, said, “Our board of directors thoroughly reviewed the Exxon Mobil transaction and concluded that it delivers superior value to InterOil shareholders. They will also benefit from their interest in Exxon Mobil’s diverse asset base and dividend stream.”

Under the terms of the deal, Exxon Mobil will pay $45 of newly issued stock for each share of InterOil. That’s about 8 percent lower than InterOil’s closing price on Wednesday, before the transaction was announced.

But the deal also includes what Exxon Mobil called a “contingent resource payment” of an additional $7.07 a share in cash for every trillion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas that is certified above 6.2 trillion cubic feet equivalent, to a maximum of 10 million cubic feet.

If InterOil’s holdings in the Elk-Antelope field in Papua New Guinea top out at 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent, the value of the deal would rise to $71.87 a share — or nearly 47 percent higher than the company’s Wednesday closing share price.

“This agreement will enable Exxon Mobil to create value for the shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea,” Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.

Exxon Mobil received legal counsel from the law firms Davis Polk & Wardwell and Blake, Cassels & Graydon. InterOil took advice from Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, UBS and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1805,"Stocks on Wall Street wobbled and finished mostly lower on Monday as the price of oil continued to nose-dive, thanks to the strong dollar.

Energy companies took the biggest losses as benchmark crude hovered around $40 a barrel, its lowest price in almost four months, and materials companies also traded lower.

Every oil, gas and pipeline company in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished lower as a slump in the price of oil and other fuels extended into a third week. The losses for energy and mining, chemical and building companies canceled out gains for technology and health care companies. A survey showed United States manufacturing continued to grow in July, but did so at a slower pace than the month before. That, too, is linked to strength in the dollar.

A survey by the Institute for Supply Management said factories in the United States expanded for the fifth consecutive month, although its survey reading was lower in July than it was in June and factory employment decreased. A survey of manufacturing in Europe showed a similar result, and two surveys showed manufacturing activity in China was relatively weak in July.

The dollar has been gaining strength over the last few years, and while it appeared to level off recently, it appears to be picking up again because investors are realizing the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates later this year. Mr. Chiavarone said that was starting to hurt oil prices and slow down manufacturing. When the dollar gets stronger, oil falls because it is priced in dollars.

CHINA DATA: China's consumer price index gained 1.8 percent last month over a year earlier, slower than June's 1.9 percent, Xinhua said citing the National Bureau of Statistics. The July figure is the third monthly drop in a row since April when the consumer price index reached its highest level since July 2014. The news came a day after China reported another fall in exports for the month of July as weak global demand hampered efforts to shore up Chinese trade.

OPEC MEETS: Amid little market-moving news, oil was in focus after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced Monday that oil ministers of the 14-nation organization will meet next month, well ahead of their previously scheduled November meeting. It is unusual for the OPEC to come together outside of their regularly set gatherings and the report pushed up the price of crude oil overnight.

ANALYST'S TAKE: ""News that OPEC would be having a September meeting with certain members keen to push for supply cuts again served as the impetus for oil prices to rally. While a deal is highly unlikely to eventuate, the fact that it is even being mentioned shows how much difficulty the past month's renewed sell-off was causing many struggling OPEC members,"" Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at IG in Melbourne, Australia, said in a daily commentary.

1811,"CARACAS — Venezuela on Tuesday said it was trying to rally support for a meeting of oil producers to agree measures to prop up oil prices, the struggling Latin American country's biggest source of income.

Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is suffering from an economic and political crisis and relies heavily on oil export revenues.

Its government has long called for oil producers to come up with measures to buoy oil prices.

President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday night on state television that he was in talks with several other oil exporters to organise a producer meeting.

""I spoke today with King Salman of Saudi Arabia. In the coming hours, I will speak to the Emir of Qatar. I sent a communique to President Vladimir Putin (of Russia). I'm going to speak too with President Rouhani from Iran. I'm in touch with President Correa (of Ecuador), members of OPEC and non-OPEC (countries),"" Maduro said on his weekly television show, adding that Venezuela was pushing to ""stabilise"" the oil price at $40 per barrel.

Venezuelan oil minister Eulogio del Pino had said on Monday that a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC countries may take place ""in the coming weeks"", and that Venezuela was ""actively promoting a meeting of producers ... so that OPEC and non-OPEC countries can sit down to see what the scenario for the winter looks like.""

After recovering for much of the first half of this year following a 70-percent price rout between 2014 and early 2016, oil prices have slumped 15 percent again since June to the low $40s per barrel as crude and refined product markets remain oversupplied.

But analysts met Venezuela's calls with scepticism.

""Another round of proposed production freeze talks by OPEC failed to excite investors,"" ANZ Bank said on Wednesday.

Russia, the world's largest oil producer, said on Monday it did not see any ground for new talks on freezing oil output but said it was open to negotiations.

Since the plunge in oil prices in 2014, Venezuela has repeatedly tried to broker deals to freeze production and reduce a supply glut, with limited success, as no oil producer was willing to cede market share by voluntarily cutting output, instead expecting competing exporters to restrict production.

As a result, OPEC members and other producers including Russia did not manage to reach an agreement on freezing supply at a meeting held in Doha in April.

OPEC members are scheduled to meet informally in September.

1812,"NEW YORK — Gasoline and diesel stockpiles have swollen to record highs across the globe, leaving refiners and traders few places to dump excess supplies and threatening large-scale production cuts that could derail an oil price recovery.

Typically, U.S. and European refiners deal with excess regional inventories by exporting extra supplies to markets where margins for diesel, gasoline, or other oil products remains strong. However, months of above-average global refinery utilization rates and the addition of refining capacity globally has left storage tanks from Houston to Singapore full to the brim.

While the crude market has been plagued by world oversupply for two years, a global glut of refined products is a relatively new phenomenon, a result of refiners boosting production last year and early this year to cash in cheap crude supply and hefty margins.

Now the only choice refiners have is to cut production, most analysts and refinery executives say, a process that some refiners in the U.S. and Europe have already started. That in turn, at least in the near-term, will weaken demand for crude oil and serve as a hard ceiling on prices.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, reached a six-month high of $52.51 a barrel in June spurring talk of a sustained oil recovery, but fears that excess global product inventories would sap demand for crude helped push prices back towards $40 earlier this month.

""Unless and until inventories drop, we will not see a sustainable increase in crude prices,"" Mark Routt, chief economist for the Americas at KBC Advanced Technology in Houston, said on Monday. Routt said he did not expect the market to rebalance until mid-2017.

In a note on Monday, Morgan Stanley analysts noted that the recent dip in oil prices has in fact boosted refining margins, encouraging refiners to produce more and delaying output cuts.

For most of this year, refining margins have been weak, driven down by swelling inventories, pummelling the earnings of independent refiners, such as Valero and Marathon Petroleum along with oil majors like ExxonMobil and BP.

U.S. gasoline inventories, which hit record highs earlier this year, ended last week at 238 million barrels, 5 percent above the five-year seasonal average, according to the U.S. Energy Department. U.S. inventories of distillates - kerosene, jet fuel, diesel and other products - were 36 percent above the five-year seasonal average at 153 million barrels.

European oil product stocks are also high at the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hub. Gasoline in independent storage is up more than 17 percent from a year ago near records at 1.16 million tonnes, according to PJK International. [ARA/]

Distillates stocks in ARA are up 2 percent from last year at 3.27 million tonnes, with some traders storing them on vessels outside European ports. In Germany, the continent’s largest diesel market, consumer inventories in early July stood at a seven-year high for this time of the year.[PROD/DE] (Graphic:http://tmsnrt.rs/2b0P2oR)

While there is no data to gauge the Asia’s fuel inventories, industry sources say they are also high. In Singapore, the region's main crude and refined products trading hub, most onshore inventories run at or near record highs, with floating tanker storage deployed to cope with the supply overhang.

“No one consumes crude, they consume products,” said a Canadian refinery executive. “Until we see those inventories come down, it will be real difficult for crude to have a strong rally again.”

Refiners can react to market conditions more quickly than drillers, so run cuts can more quickly balance out excess product supplies, Goldman Sachs analysts said Tuesday. They expect global refinery maintenance to be above the five-year average in the third quarter but to return to normal levels for the remainder of the year.

Routt said Asian refiners including Japan, South Korea and even oil-thirsty China, keep exporting excess fuels overseas, adding to the glut. China on Monday reported record refined product exports just as its industrial and manufacturing sales took another hit, the latest sign of weak growth in Asia's biggest economy.

He said the biggest victims of the global supply glut will probably be European and Russian refineries, who will be forced to make the deepest production cuts.

“China will not back down, and I don’t think America will either, that leaves Europe and Russia,” Routt said.

1816,"Stocks on Wall Street ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and the retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.

However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news from the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,432.24. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.

The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, because of the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.

Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.

The gains came after the Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said OPEC members and nonmembers would discuss the market situation, including any action that may be required to stabilize prices, during an informal meeting on Sept. 26-28 in Algeria.

“Energy is such a common denominator for all economies that the sort of move that we’re seeing there has to be of reassurance,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. “A week or so ago oil seemed to be tumbling again, and now we’ve come back to a level where it seems to be stabilizing.”

MIDDLEBURY, Vt. — THERE are shameful photos of me on the internet.

In one series, my groceries are being packed into plastic bags, as I’d forgotten to bring cloth ones. In other shots, I am getting in and out of … cars. There are video snippets of me giving talks, or standing on the street. Sometimes I see the cameraman, sometimes I don’t. The images are often posted to Twitter, reminders that I’m being watched.

In April, Politico and The Hill reported that America Rising Squared, an arm of the Republican opposition research group America Rising, had decided to go after me and Tom Steyer, another prominent environmentalist, with a campaign on a scale previously reserved for presidential candidates. Using what The Hill called “an unprecedented amount of effort and money,” the group, its executive director said, was seeking to demonstrate our “epic hypocrisy and extreme positions.”

Since then, my days in public have often involved cameramen walking backward and videotaping my every move. It’s mostly when I travel (I’ve encountered them in at least five states so far, as well as in Australia), and generally when I’m in a public or semipublic space. They aren’t interested in my arguments; instead, these videos, usually wordless, are simply posted on Twitter, almost always with music. One showed me sitting in a church pew, accompanied by the song “Show Me That Smile.” The tweet read, “Ready for his close-up.”

Someone also went to the archive at Texas Tech University, where my papers are stored, and asked for copies of everything in all 54 boxes. He identified himself as being with a group that is affiliated with America Rising Squared.

This effort has resulted in all kinds of odd things appearing on right-wing corners of the web: out-of-context quotations from old books and articles apparently put on display to prove I’m a zealot, and photos from God knows who intended to make me out as a hypocrite (the plastic bags, for instance, and my travel by car, which, you know, burns gas). Mostly, they’ve just published those creepy videos, to remind me that I’m under surveillance.

I understand that this isn’t horrible in the way that police brutality is horrible, or having your home swept away by a flood is horrible. I know that in other parts of the world, environmentalists have worse things than cameras pointed at them. From Honduras to the Philippines, in the last two years, activists have been assassinated after getting in the way of megaprojects.

And I get, as well-meaning friends keep reminding me, that at some level it’s all tribute to our movement’s work in helping kill the Keystone pipeline and highlighting Exxon’s climate history, campaigns that cost the industry a lot of money. But I also understand that the simple fact that I’ve done nothing wrong is no defense against the destruction of a reputation: These are the same kind of people who turned John Kerry, a bona fide war hero, into a traitor through twisting and manipulation.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
1820,"Don’t even ask about gay rights.

Instead of calls for jihad, what I heard were religious leaders insisting that the faithful obey the state. The Saudi royal family is terrified that the jihadist fervor inflaming the region will catch fire at home and threaten its control. So it has marshaled the state’s religious apparatus to condemn the jihadists and proclaim the religious duty of obedience to the rulers.

And while it was once common, I heard little disparaging talk about Christians and Jews, although it was open season on Shiites, whose faith is frequently bashed as part of the rivalry with Iran.

The only Saudis who suggested I was an infidel were children.

Once, a Saudi journalist proudly introduced me to his 9-year-old daughter, whom he had put in private school so she could study English.

“What is your name?” I asked.

“My name is Dana,” she said.

“How old are you?”

“I am 9.”

“When is your birthday?”

Confused, she switched to Arabic.

“We don’t have that in Saudi Arabia,” she said. “That’s an infidel holiday.”

Shocked, her father asked where she had learned that, and she fetched one of her government-issued textbooks, flipping to a lesson that listed “forbidden holidays”: Christmas and Thanksgiving. Birthdays had been part of the same lesson.

Another time, I met a religious friend for coffee, and he brought his two young sons. When the call to prayer sounded, my friend went to pray. His sons, confused that I did not follow, looked at me wide-eyed and asked, “Are you an infidel?”

What Is a Wahhabi?

The first thing many Saudis will tell you about Wahhabism is that it does not exist.

“There is no such thing as Wahhabism,” Hisham al-Sheikh told me the first time we met. “There is only true Islam.”

The irony is that fewer people have a purer Wahhabi pedigree than Mr. Sheikh, a direct descendant of the cleric who started it all.

In the early 18th century, Sheikh Mohammed ibn Abdul-Wahhab called for a religious reformation in central Arabia. Feeling that Islam had been corrupted by practices like the veneration of saints and tombs, he called for the stripping away of “innovations” and the return to what he considered the pure religion.

He formed an alliance with a chieftain named Mohammed ibn Saud that has underpinned the area’s history ever since. Then the Saud family assumed political leadership while Sheikh Abdul-Wahhab and his descendants gave legitimacy to their rule and managed religious affairs.

That mix proved potent among the warring Arabian tribes, as Wahhabi clerics provided justification for military conquest in some cases: Those who resisted the House of Saud were not just enemies, but infidels who deserved the sword.

The first Saudi state was destroyed by the Ottomans in 1818, and attempts to build another failed until the early 20th century, when King Abdulaziz al-Saud undertook a campaign that put him in control of most of the Arabian Peninsula.

But the king faced a choice: to continue expansionary jihad, which would have invited conflict with the British, or to build a modern state. He chose the latter, even crushing a group of his own warriors who refused to stop fighting.

Since then, the alliance between the royal family and the clerics has endured, although the tensions between the quest for ideological purity and the exigencies of modern statehood remain throughout Saudi society.

Fast forward to 2016, and the main players have transformed because of time and oil wealth. The royal family has grown from a group of scrappy desert dwellers into a sprawling clan awash in palaces and private jets. The Wahhabi establishment has evolved from a puritan reform movement into a bloated state bureaucracy.

It consists of universities that churn out graduates trained in religious disciplines; a legal system in which judges apply Shariah law; a council of top clerics who advise the king; a network of offices that dispense fatwas, or religious opinions; a force of religious police who monitor public behavior; and tens of thousands of mosque imams who can be tapped to deliver the government’s message from the pulpit.

The call to prayer sounds five times a day from mosques and inside of malls so clearly that many Saudis use it to organize their days.

“Let’s meet after the sunset prayer,” they would tell me, sometimes unsure what time that was. So I installed an app on my phone that let me look up prayer times and buzzed when the call sounded.

And so it was, after the sunset prayer, that I met Mr. Sheikh, a proud sixth-generation descendant of Mohammed ibn Abdul-Wahhab.

He was a portly man of 42 who wore a long white robe and covered his head with a schmag, or checkered cloth. His beard was long and he had no mustache, in imitation of the Prophet Muhammad, and he squinted through reading glasses perched on his nose while peering at his iPhone.

We sat on purple couches in the music-free lobby of a Riyadh hotel and shared dates and coffee while he answered my questions about Islam in Saudi Arabia.

“I am an open-minded person,” he told me early on.

It was clear that he hoped I would become a Muslim.

His life had been defined by the religious establishment, but he proved to be a case study in the complexity of terms like “modern” and “traditional” in Saudi Arabia. He had memorized the Quran at a young age and studied with prominent clerics before completing his doctorate in Shariah, with his thesis on how technology changed the application of Shariah.

Now he had a successful career and a host of religious jobs. He trained judges for the Shariah courts, advised the minister of Islamic affairs, wrote studies for the clerics who advise the king and served on the Shariah board of the Medgulf insurance company. On Fridays, he preached at a mosque near his mother’s house and welcomed visitors who came to see his uncle, the grand mufti.

He had traveled extensively abroad, and when he found out I was American he told me that he loved the United States. He had visited Oregon, New York, Massachusetts and Los Angeles. On one trip, he visited a synagogue. On another, a black church. He had also visited an Amish community, which he found fascinating.

A relative of his lived in Montgomery, Ala., and he had spent happy months there, often visiting the local Islamic center. The hardest part, he said, was Ramadan, because there were few eateries open late that did not have bars.

“All I had was IHOP,” he said.

He said Islam did not forbid doing business or having friendships with Christians or Jews. He opposed Shiite beliefs and practices, but said it was wrong to do as the extremists of the Islamic State and declare takfir, or infidelity, on entire groups.

When it came to birthdays, which many Saudi clerics condemn, he said he did not oppose them, although his wife did, so their children did not go to birthday parties. But they had celebrations of their own, he said, showing me a video on his phone of his family gathered around a cake bearing the face of his son Abdullah, 15, who had just memorized the Quran. They lit sparklers and cheered, but did not sing.

He was on the fence about music, which many Wahhabis also forbid. He said he had no problem with background music in restaurants, but opposed music that put listeners in a state similar to drunkenness, causing them to jump around and bang their heads.

“We have something better,” he said. “You can listen to the Quran.”

Since much of what differentiates Saudi Arabia is the place of women, I wanted to talk to a conservative Saudi woman, which was tricky because most would refuse to meet with any unrelated male — let alone a non-Muslim correspondent from the United States. So I had a female Saudi colleague, Sheikha al-Dosary, contact Mr. Sheikh’s wife, Meshael, who said she would meet me.

But I asked Mr. Sheikh’s permission.

“She is very busy,” he said, and changed the subject.

So Ms. Sheikh met Ms. Dosary at a women’s coffee shop in Riyadh, where women can uncover their faces and hair.

Her marriage to Mr. Sheikh had been arranged, she said. They met once for less than an hour before they were married, and he had seen her face.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
1821,"DUBAI — Qatar's energy minister, and current OPEC president, said on Monday the oil market is on the path to rebalancing despite the recent decline in global oil prices, adding that OPEC was in continuous talks to stabilise the market.

""The recent decline observed in oil prices and the current market volatility is only temporary,"" Mohammad bin Saleh al-Sada, Qatar’s minister of energy and industry said in a statement.

""OPEC continues to monitor developments closely, and is in constant deliberations with all member states on ways and means to help restore stability and order to the oil market.""

Qatar holds the OPEC presidency for 2016.

An informal meeting of OPEC member countries is scheduled to take place on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria from Sept. 26-28, the statement said.

Oil prices rose on Monday, lifted by reports of renewed talks by some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrain output.

The price rise came on the back of renewed calls by some OPEC members to freeze production in a bid to rein in output, a demand that non-OPEC oil producing giant Russia was quick to dismiss.

Brent futures were up 15 cents at $44.42 per barrel Monday, though still lag a 2016 high near $53 a barrel hit in June.

Sada said the recent decline in price was ""more of an outcome resulting from weaker refinery margins, inventory overhang — particularly of product stocks, timing of Brexit and its impact on the financial futures markets, including that of crude oil"".

He said an expected ""higher crude oil demand in third and fourth quarters of 2016, coupled with a decrease in availability, is leading the analysts to conclude that the current bear market is only temporary and that the oil price will increase in the later part of 2016.""

Some OPEC officials had said a revival of talks on a global oil production freeze could be discussed at an informal meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC in Algeria in September, if oil prices weaken.

OPEC member Iran has been the main opponent of a freeze as it looks to raise its output to levels seen before the imposition of now-ended Western sanctions.

1822,"NEW YORK — Oil rose about 2 percent on Friday, clinching its biggest weekly gains since April, after a short covering rally was triggered by comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister in the previous session about possible action to help stabilize the market.

Crude pared some gains after data showed U.S. oil drillers added rigs for a seventh straight week, the longest recovery in the rig count in more than two years. They added 17 rigs, the biggest increase since December.

Brent crude futures settled 93 cents higher at $46.97 at barrel after touching $47.05, the highest in more than three weeks.

U.S. crude settled up $1 at $44.49 after touching its highest level since July 22 at $44.60 per barrel.

Both contracts notched weekly gains of about 6 percent, the biggest since late April.

On Thursday, crude surged nearly 5 percent after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said oil producers would discuss potential action to stabilize oil prices during a meeting next month in Algeria.

The news spurred short covering, traders and brokers said, even though the likelihood of any agreement remained slim.

""Although we regard such an agreement, let alone its implementation, as unrealistic, it is dampening fears of a continuation of the OPEC price war,"" Commerzbank said in a note.

Oil prices have recovered since U.S. crude fell below $40 last week, but are still more than 12 percent below their last peak in June, as brimming storage tanks and production that exceeds consumption weighs on markets.

""Despite the recent bounce in prices, we continue to believe that the oil market remains in oversold territory,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a research note.

""As such, the price path forward will likely remain choppy and non-linear since price moves can and will often be exacerbated in either direction.""

Iran slashed its September official selling price for light crude to Asia by $1.30 a barrel, the latest sign that exporters are willing to accept discounts in return for market share.

Traders said a drop of 8.1 percent in China's oil output in July, to a five-year low of 16.72 million tonnes, also lifted prices because it would mean Asia's biggest economy has to import more crude.

""As both a consumer and a refiner of oil – the country's refineries processed 2.5 percent more crude oil than last year in July – China is thus contributing to the tightening of the oil market,"" Commerzbank said.

1824,"LONDON — Global demand for oil will grow less than expected next year due to a weaker world economy, though the oversupply of crude in the market is ending, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.

The Paris-based agency, which consults oil-importing nations, lowered its forecast for demand growth next year to 1.2 million barrels a day from 1.3 million barrels a day previously. That would be a slowdown from this year's growth of 1.4 million barrels a day.

However, the agency said in its monthly report that it expects oversupply to have ended in the third quarter of this year, with inventories likely to drop after a long period of increases.

That, the IEA said, will ""help pave the way to a sustained tightening of the crude oil balance.""

1829,"(Reuters) - U.S. crude's slide below $40 a barrel this week has hardened the resolve of oil market bears to drive prices lower, with oversupply, refining cutbacks and a breakdown in the oil/dollar trade spelling an end to this year's rally.

Few believe oil will revisit the 12-year lows of $26 to $27 a barrel seen in the first quarter, but many are zeroing in on $35 a barrel or lower for U.S. crude. Short bets have increased in recent weeks as investors believe the spring rally that nearly doubled the price of oil took the market too far, too fast.

""The bandwagon trade just two months ago was that we will hit $60, but now $35 is looking like more of a reality,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.

""We're in a vicious cycle, with no sign of this glut in oil products disappearing anytime soon, while any cutback by refiners is backing up crude into the system. This tells me the rally is over,"" said Kilduff. He said he was using mostly options and futures positions to bet on $35 oil.

Crude inventories jumped by 1.4 million barrels in the most recent week, surprising forecasters who expected an identical draw. The build brought stockpiles, minus the U.S. strategic reserve, to an all-time seasonal high of 522.5 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Department.

OPEC oil producers are pumping near record high levels while top crude exporter Saudi Arabia cut prices for its Asian customers at the weekend, signaling another price war and tussle for crude market share.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled below $40 on Tuesday for the first time since April. It ended Wednesday at $40.83 a barrel.

Tariq Zahir, an oil bear who trades mostly in timespreads of WTI, is betting the spot U.S. price will not hold above $40 for long.

""I'm selling into this rally,"" Zahir, who heads Tyche Capital Advisors in New York, said Wednesday. Having frequently made money this year betting nearer-dated oil contracts will weaken against farther-dated deliveries, Zahir was also emboldened by short bets that have built up lately against WTI.

Speculators, including hedge funds, have turned increasingly bearish toward crude and refined products in the last two months, adding the equivalent of 56 million barrels of extra short positions in the three main Brent and WTI futures and options contracts in the week ending July 26.

Oil's recent tumble came amid a breakdown in its correlation with the dollar. When the dollar falls, oil usually rises. That did not happen earlier this week when the U.S. currency fell to six-week lows. Some saw that as a bearish sign.

Yet others expect stronger oil prices. Goldman Sachs on Wednesday maintained its 2017 target for oil at $52.50. The bank noted that most of the sell-off has been the result of declines in far-dated contracts, suggesting a ""repricing of long-term potential supply,"" rather than a reassessment of current conditions.

French bank Societe Generale said in a note on Tuesday that compared to the first quarter of the year, when global stocks were rising, now, ""global supply and demand are roughly balanced, in large part due to steadily declining U.S. crude production.""

Signatures due for ballot measures to limit fracking.

Monday is the deadline for environmental activists in Colorado to submit the signatures required to put two proposals on the state’s ballot in November. Both would restrict hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas fields. Hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, allows oil companies to fracture shale and other hard rocks with water, chemicals and sand to free oil and gas. Environmentalists contend that the practice can pollute air and local water supplies, but the companies insist it is safe. The more aggressive of the two initiatives would amend the Colorado Constitution to outlaw fracking within 2,500 feet of occupied buildings, water resources and public spaces like parks.

Valeant earnings may indicate if it can correct course.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals will report its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, providing new clues about how and whether the company can climb out of its current morass. One focus will be on how Joseph C. Papa, Valeant’s new chief executive, plans to reduce the company’s debt to avoid possible violations of its covenants in 2017, according to David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. There is also speculation that Valeant will again reduce its earnings forecasts for 2016, having done so twice already. Mr. Papa was named chief executive in late April, replacing J. Michael Pearson, who had built Valeant through serial acquisitions and aggressive price increases on old drugs. But the once high-flying company fell to earth starting last fall as concerns arose about those price increases, the high debt from all those acquisitions and Valeant’s once-secret relationship with a mail-order pharmacy. Valeant faces various federal investigations and its stock has fallen more than 90 percent from its peak a year ago. Andrew Pollack

Iger to discuss Disney’s third-quarter results.

It was the Disney earnings call that sent shock waves through the media industry: One year ago, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, acknowledged that fewer people were subscribing to ESPN as part of a traditional cable package, starting a panic about the future of television. Disney’s stock has since fallen 20 percent. So, when Mr. Iger again takes the mike on Tuesday to discuss its fiscal third-quarter results, all eyes will be on ESPN. Insight into Disney’s latest thoughts about piping its television networks to consumers over the internet is hoped for.

Wall Street will also be paying attention to Disney’s theme parks. How is the new Shanghai Disneyland doing? How strong is Disney World in Florida, where an alligator attack led to negative headlines? Are safety fears (especially after the nightclub shooting in Orlando) taking any toll? Brooks Barnes

ECONOMY

Macy’s earnings and national sales data.

Two important indicators of the health of the economy will come out this week. Macy’s, the nation’s largest department store, is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. The retailer has struggled to compete against the growth of discount and low-cost rivals, particularly online, and revealed unexpectedly weak results last quarter. And on Friday, the Commerce Department will release retail sales data. Analysts expect the data to show that spending climbed slightly in July. Rachel Abrams

Estimating August consumer sentiment.

On Friday morning, the University of Michigan will report its initial estimate of consumer sentiment in August. Economists expect to see a slight rise in the index to 91.3, from a final July reading of 90, reflecting healthy hiring, a strong housing market and continued low energy prices. The stock market’s July rebound after the vote by Britain in June to leave the European Union also bodes well for the consumer outlook this summer. Nelson D.

New Zealand's NZE50 index was down less than 0.1 percent at 7,346.64 after New Zealand's central bank lowered official interest rates by a quarter point to 2 percent, disappointing some investors looking for a more aggressive cut. Southeast Asian markets were mixed.

WALL STREET: A sharp sell-off in energy companies pulled U.S. stock indexes modestly lower Wednesday, wiping out small gains from the day before. Another slide in crude oil prices weighed on the energy sector. Banking, health care and technology companies also declined, while consumer-focused stocks and phone companies posted gains.

1835,"SINGAPORE — Oil prices fell on Friday as a crude and refined product glut weighed on markets and investors eyed a possible stutter in China's imports, ending a two-day short-covering rally.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures <CLc1> were trading at $41.59 per barrel at 0340 GMT, down 34 cents, or 0.81 percent, from their last close.

International Brent crude futures <LCOc1> were trading at $43.89 per barrel, down 40 cents, or 0.90 percent.

Traders said oil markets came under renewed pressure from overproduction in crude and refined products that has left onshore storage tanks filled to the rims and triggered the chartering of tankers to store unsold fuel.

On the demand side, BMI Research said China's imports were weakening from records set in 2015 and this year.

""China's near-term crude imports will remain sluggish due to a combination of factors including brimming commercial fuel stockpiles, slower off-take growth among teapots (refiners) and a more gradual pace of strategic stock building,"" BMI said.

Friday's slump ended a mid-week rally driven in large part by those holding short positions booking profits from a more than 20 percent fall in oil prices between June and early August, traders said.

""Oil prices rallied (Wednesday and Thursday) despite little fundamental data. However, with CFTC data showing investors increased their shorts positions the most ever for the week ending 26 July, this suggests a short covering rally,"" ANZ bank said on Friday.

LONDON — As energy prices start to rebound, a group of oil workers in the North Sea are gearing up for a strike, saying the industrywide cuts have been too deep.

The labor action, by unions representing about 400 maintenance workers on seven oil production platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell, is part of the broad struggle to find a new equilibrium.

“Pressure is mounting not just in the North Sea but in many different regions for producers to start spending as oil prices rise,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm.

When oil prices soared to more than $100 a barrel, costs followed. Oil companies spent heavily to ramp up production and invested heavily in big, expensive projects.

The drop in prices naturally prompted a sharp pull back. Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research in London, estimates that the industry has cut operating costs by about 45 percent in the United States, and 20 percent elsewhere.

So far, contract workers like the ones threatening the strike have borne the brunt of the pain, in terms of layoffs and pay cuts. Their employers, largely service providers, have seen a significant reduction in what they can charge the operators like Shell for drilling, laying pipe, painting platforms, and just about everything else.

The looming strike in the North Sea — along with the other recent signs of strife among oil service companies — may mean that it will be hard to squeeze out further savings. And rising prices, now around $45 a barrel, give producers less cover for passing on the pain.

The labor unions in the North Sea have said their members won’t work overtime on Monday, and will begin a full-fledged 24-hour stoppage on Tuesday. The job actions, which the unions plan to continue over the coming weeks, are not expected to lead to reduced production, at least in the early stages.

“We understand there is a downturn in the North Sea,” said John Boland, an official of Unite, which is helping to organize the strike. “But the level of cuts being proposed are too much.”

Signs of labor unrest have been bubbling up in recent months.

In late June, oil workers in Argentina took action, demanding higher pay. A strike by Norwegian oil workers over pay and more flexible work practices was narrowly averted this month. In April, a brief work stoppage by Kuwaiti oil workers sharply cut the country’s production.

Oil service providers are also hoping for some relief.

Paal Kibsgaard, the chief executive of Schlumberger, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies, told analysts on Friday that prices had reached the “bottom of the cycle.” He said that Schlumberger was now “looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or to renegotiate those contracts which at present show no promise of becoming financially viable.”

As a high cost, mature region, Britain’s North Sea has been hit particularly hard by the slowdown. Over the last two years, the work force directly employed by the industry has fallen by nearly 8,000 to 34,000, while another 50,000 indirect jobs have been lost.

Some of the remaining workers have already been forced to accept reduced pay or changes to their rotations. For instance, they may be required to stay at sea for three consecutive weeks, instead of two, a shift that saves money in helicopter flights and other costs.

“It is clear that in order for the North Sea oil and gas industry to remain competitive in the lower oil price environment, structural change is needed,” Shell said in a statement, calling the planned strike “highly regrettable.”

The workers planning to strike on Tuesday are employed by Wood Group, a large oil services company based in Aberdeen, Scotland. Wood Group then contracts them to Shell, which has considerable leverage over the people employed.

The unions say that a new contract proposal will, in effect, cut pay as much as 30 percent. Wood Group puts the average at 3 percent.

But the job actions may not hurt Shell much, at least in the short term. The people involved, Shell says, are maintenance workers, not crucial operating personnel.

Shell has already said that it has its entire portfolio under review for potential sale. Analysts say the platforms threatened by the strike, which are relatively old, might be candidates. And Mr. Clint of Bernstein Research estimates that Shell’s share of production from the seven platforms is just 14,000 barrels a day, a tiny fraction of its overall 3.6 million barrels.

“It will have no impact on us,” said Philip Robinson, a Shell spokesman. “We have prepared.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1842,"Wall Street capped a record-setting week with a day of mostly listless trading Friday that left the three major U.S. stock indexes essentially flat.

The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed slightly lower. The Nasdaq composite eked out a tiny gain, giving the tech-heavy index its fourth record-high close in a week.

Investors mostly focused on the latest batch of company earnings from retailers and other companies, as well as new data indicating that U.S. retail sales in July were more sluggish than expected.

Materials companies fell the most. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices rose again.

While the retail sales data may have dimmed some traders' views on the economy, most of the selling was likely a reflection of some investors locking in profits while the market remains near its all-time high, said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist.

""It's a summer Friday on a week that we were higher,"" Kinahan said. ""It's more of a 'Why take unnecessary risks? Take some profits, go home happy.'""

The Dow fell 37.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,576.47. The S&P 500 index lost 1.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,184.05. The declines pulled both indexes slightly below their most-recent all-time highs set Thursday.

The Nasdaq bucked the trend, adding 4.50 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,232.89. The Nasdaq also closed at a record high last Friday, Tuesday and Thursday. It's now up 11 percent over the past seven weeks, the longest winning streak for the index in more than four years.

So far this year, the Dow is up 6.6 percent, the S&P 500 has gained 6.9 percent and the Nasdaq is up 4.5 percent.

Strong job growth, more stable oil prices and a crop of better-than-expected company earnings have helped lift stocks in recent weeks.

This week, investors had their eye on the health of retailers. They welcomed the latest quarterly snapshots for Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom, sending their shares higher.

Some of that continued Friday as traders cheered results from Nordstrom, J.C. Penney and Dillard's.

Nordtsrom surged 8 percent a day after the department store chain reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations. The company also raised its profit guidance for the year. The stock gained $3.82 to $51.38.

J.C. Penney said a pickup in sales helped trim the chain's second-quarter loss from a year earlier. The stock added 61 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $10.55. Dillard's rose 3.4 percent after the retailer posted a second-quarter profit that was larger than analysts expected. Its shares gained $2.26 to $68.67.

Even so, the government's latest retail sales figures appeared to dampen on some of that optimism.

The Commerce Department said that U.S. retail sales held steady in July from the previous month, as Americans spent less at grocery stores, clothing shops, sporting goods and electronics and appliance outlets. Those declines were offset by big increases in auto sales and on online and catalog sales.

Separately, the Labor Department said producer prices posted the biggest drop last month since September, pulled down by tumbling energy, clothing and food prices. Inflation remains modest at both producer and consumer levels.

Despite the downbeat economic data, the market spent much of the day hovering just below its all-time highs.

""It's very understandable that people are not particularly keen to rush into buying at these historically high levels,"" said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""Add in this economic data that leans to the weaker side and it's not surprising that the market is off a little bit.""

Industrial and drilling companies were among the biggest decliners.

Transocean slid the most among stocks in the S&P 500, shedding 47 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $9.90. Steel products manufacturer Nucor fell $1.66, or 3.2 percent, to $50.69, while Alcoa slipped 25 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $10.17.

Oil prices added to recent gains.

Benchmark U.S. crude was rose $1, or 2.3 percent, to close at $44.49 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 93 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $46.97 a barrel in London.

In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added a penny to $1.37 a gallon, while heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.41 a gallon. Natural gas gained 3 cents to $2.58 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The major stock indexes in Europe mostly closed lower. The DAX index in Germany fell 0.3 percent, while France's CAC 40 was slid 0.1 percent. Britain's FTSE was flat.

Earlier in Asia, the Shanghai Composite index added 1.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent after China reported retail sales and factory output increased sharply in July from a year earlier, even as they declined from June 2016's levels. Elsewhere in the region, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index rose 1.1 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4 percent. India's Sensex gained 1 percent. Markets in Southeast Asia were mostly higher.

Gold and other precious metals declined. Gold slid $6.70, or 0.5 percent, to $1,335.80 an ounce. Silver lost 32 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $19.70 an ounce. Copper fell 5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.14 a pound.

Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.51 percent from 1.56 late Thursday.

In currency markets, the dollar weakened to 101.27 yen from 101.93 on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.1164 from $1.1141.

Among other stocks that made big moves Friday:

— Concordia International slumped 38.1 percent after the drugmaker reported disappointing sales, cut its annual forecasts and suspended its dividend. The stock shed $6.23 to $10.13.

— Ruby Tuesday's slid 13.1 percent after the restaurant chain reported weak sales and said it would shutter 95 of its company-owned locations by September. The stock lost 49 cents to $3.24.

— Silicon Graphics jumped 28.6 percent on news that Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to buy the computer equipment and services company for about $281 million.

1845,"STAVANGER, Norway — Norway wants to get rid of gasoline-fueled cars, plans to become carbon neutral by 2030 and spends billions on helping poor countries reduce their carbon footprints. Meanwhile, it's pushing ever farther into the Arctic Ocean in search of more oil and gas.

""We know there is a paradox,"" admits Vidar Helgesen, Norway's climate and energy minister. ""We have been living well from oil and gas. But there is no country in the world that has done more to undermine the oil and gas industry than Norway.""

The mountainous Scandinavian country of 5 million people is torn between its ambition to be a global leader on climate change and the awareness that its wealth is linked to the world's dependence on fossil fuels.

This apparent contradiction is particularly striking in Stavanger, Norway's oil capital.

The west coast town is the hub of an offshore industry that has made Norway the world's eighth biggest exporter of oil and third biggest exporter of natural gas. Norway's $875 billion oil kitty is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, and hydrocarbons account for 40 percent of Norwegian exports.

But very little of those fossil fuels are used at home. Like the rest of the country, Stavanger gets almost all its electricity from hydropower.

And the streams of Teslas driven by oil workers through the streets of Stavanger attest to the rich subsidies the government has poured into the electric car market. E-cars have zero import duty, sales tax is a quarter less than for conventional vehicles and most roads are free.

Some 29 percent of new cars sold in Norway are electric or hybrid. The government in June introduced a target of 100 percent by 2025.

Helgesen says Norway's example is spreading around the world, with once-skeptical car manufacturers investing in green technology and speeding the transition away from hydrocarbons.

In June, lawmakers forced through a commitment for Norway to become carbon neutral by 2030 — some 20 years ahead of schedule.

Norway is also one of the most generous donors to international initiatives to maintain rainforests, which help fight climate change by absorbing some of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide released by the burning of fossil fuels.

It has already spent $1 billion saving trees in Brazil and is committed to spend up to $350 million a year preserving trees in places like Indonesia and Guyana.

But Norway is accused of environmental hypocrisy, grandstanding overseas with environmental projects while allowing its domestic oil and gas industry to pump ever larger quantities of carbon into the atmosphere. Plans for carbon neutrality involve buying credits for helping reduce emissions abroad.

In fact, Norway was one of the few Western countries to see a rise in domestic carbon emissions in 2015. That was mainly due to the fact that its aging North Sea oil fields require ever more energy to tap depleting reservoirs.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

""The plan has always been to buy carbon credits to allow us to continue polluting as a country,"" says Lars Haltbrekken, chairman of the Norwegian chapter of Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy group.

""That is why we don't think carbon neutrality is the most important factor in combatting climate change,"" he says. ""We can buy credits in developing countries. It doesn't require us to reduce emissions here in Norway.""

A tougher European Union scheme will set emissions reduction targets within the next two years. But Norway, which is not an EU member, will still be able to trade emissions credits with European neighbors to reach its reduction quota.

Meanwhile, environmental activists bristle at exploration permits handed out to 13 oil companies in May to drill in a new area of the Norwegian Arctic. Critics say the technology to safely explore in such remote areas is not properly tested and claim plunging prices make Arctic oil unaffordable without hefty Norwegian subsidies. While companies pay 78 percent tax on hydrocarbons they produce in Norwegian waters, they can claim back the same amount on costs for exploration.

""We absolutely regard this as a subsidy,"" says Ellen Viseth, a political advisor at the Bellona environmental group.

Viseth says the Barents Sea north of Norway is already one of the most expensive places in the world to produce oil.

""The price and the risk make it uneconomical,"" she says. ""But the Norwegian government is heavily supporting the oil and gas industry. The oil companies don't take much of a risk but their upside is huge.""

Norway's state-owned energy company Statoil scooped up the largest share of exploration rights in the latest licensing round. Chevron and ConoccoPhillips also secured permits.

In June, Norway became one of the first countries to ratify last year's Paris Agreement on climate change, which seeks to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) compared with pre-industrial times.

Haltbrekken says that any Norwegian contribution to this target that does not involve a reduction in oil and gas is empty.

Helgesen disagrees.

""We are living in a time of tremendous energy transformation,"" he says. ""We want to play a part whether it is in electrification, bio-energy, hydropower, or any other green energy. But Norway has the cleanest hydrocarbons anywhere in the world. And as long as the world needs oil and gas, we will provide it.""","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1871,"A sharp sell-off in energy companies pulled Wall Street indexes modestly lower Wednesday, wiping out small gains from the day before.

Another slide in crude oil prices weighed on the energy sector. Banking, health care and technology companies also declined, while consumer-focused stocks and phone companies posted gains.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,495.66. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index shed 6.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,175.49. The Nasdaq composite index lost 20.90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,204.58.

Investors mostly focused on company earnings from retailers, restaurant chains and other companies.

“We’re still down year-over-year for the quarter, but there’s a growing conviction that the headwinds from the energy bust and strong dollar are increasingly fading,” said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.

A strong jobs report last Friday bolstered investors’ confidence in the United States economy. Traders are looking ahead to Friday, when the government delivers its latest monthly retail sales figures.

Most companies have already delivered their quarterly report cards, and earnings and revenue have been relatively good. Some 90 percent of the companies in the S. & P. 500-stock index have already reported second-quarter results, and approximately 65 percent posted earnings that beat Wall Street’s expectations, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Even so, earnings over all are expected to be down 2.1 percent, dragged down by the energy sector, which has been struggling with a steep drop in oil prices.

A report showing a bigger-than-expected increase in oil stockpiles last week weighed on the price of crude, reversing an early gain.

Benchmark crude oil fell $1.06, or 2.5 percent, to close at $41.71 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid 93 cents, or 2.1 percent, to close at $44.05 per barrel in London.

Several companies reported disappointing quarterly results or outlooks on Wednesday.

The clothing company Michael Kors slid 2.8 percent after it forecast weaker sales for the current quarter and lowered its outlook for sales at established stores. Its shares fell $1.40, to $48.71.

The pharmaceuticals company Perrigo sank 9.6 percent after it cut its guidance for the year, citing growing competition and falling prescription drug prices. Perrigo lost $9.09, to $86.

SunPower, a solar products and service company, tumbled 30.2 percent after it said its power plant business was struggling in the face of growing competition and project delays. It lost $4.47, to $10.31.

Markets overseas were mixed.

The DAX in Germany and CAC 40 in France each dipped 0.4 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent.

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 lost 0.2 percent despite a report showing private sector machinery orders rebounded in June from May.

1872,"NEW YORK — Oil prices jumped more than 3 percent on Wednesday, with U.S. crude futures returning to above $40 a barrel, after a larger-than-expected gasoline draw offset a surprise build in crude stockpiles in the No. 1 oil consumer.

U.S. crude inventories rose for a second week in a row, gaining 1.4 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 1.4 million barrels, Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed.

Gasoline stocks slumped by 3.3 million barrels, versus forecasts for a 200,000-barrel drop. The large draw assuaged some market participants' worry of a gasoline glut amid the peak U.S. summer driving season.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude <CLc1> settled up $1.32, or 3.3 percent, at $40.83 a barrel. On Tuesday, it settled below $40 a barrel for the first time since April.

Brent crude <LCOc1> rose $1.30, or 3.1 percent, to settle at $43.10. It hit a more than three-month low of $41.51 the previous day.

""We are not surprised to see spot prices rebounding on the gasoline draw,"" said Tariq Zahir, trader in crude oil spreads at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. ""But I think this will be short-lived.""

""The bottom line is the Street in the second quarter got a little ahead of itself in calling for rebalancing of supply-demand after Canadian and Nigerian supply disruptions. We are going into the third and fourth quarters with those supplies back online and refinery maintenance coming up.""

Oil rallied from 12-year lows of $26-$27 in the first quarter to almost $53 in June, boosted initially by expectations, later dashed, that OPEC would freeze output and later by supply outages.

But a worldwide oversupply since in motor fuels and other refined products has stymied the rebound. Worries about slowing economies in Asia - the driver of oil demand growth - and Europe have weighed, along with near record-high OPEC output and signs of a new price war by Saudi Arabia for crude.

Troy Vincent, analyst at New York-based oil cargo tracker ClipperData, said while last week's gasoline draw was a relief, the rise in crude stocks despite a near 1 percent growth in refinery utilization was a ""bigger concern"".

The global glut has led many traders to predict lower prices going forth.

""We expect to see a little bit of price consolidation from here but our target really is for $35 WTI, which means any rebound you get will be more of a bear market correction,"" said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Tactical Management in Riverside, Connecticut.

Goldman Sachs held its 2017 forecast of $52.50 and near-term range of $45-$50 for WTI. But it noted that oil's recent decline came amid supportive factors like the dollar weakening and refining margins for gasoline <1RBc1-CLc1> widening.

""It will take a strong reversal in positioning to create substantial new upside,"" Goldman said.

1873,"Soft economic data weighed on the dollar and Treasury yields on Friday and pressured stock prices, but Wall Street’s losses were softened by continued gains in oil prices.

Retail sales were unexpectedly flat in July as Americans cut back on purchases of clothing and other goods.

“That was certainly the headline; I think it spooked a lot of investors this morning,” John Traynor, chief investment officer of People’s United Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Conn., said of the retail sales report.

“But the underlying news is still very positive,” Mr. Traynor said. “Wages are growing, employment is growing and that’s key.”

Shares of the chip maker Nvidia shares rose 5.6 percent after its results helped bolster the Nasdaq.

All three indicators ended at record highs on Thursday, the first time they have done so simultaneously since 1999, and they posted slim weekly gains.

Also among the day’s bright spots, the department store chain Nordstrom rose 8 percent to $51.38 after it reported better-than-expected comparable sales and quarterly profit.

Energy shares were the best-performing S.&P. sector, rising 0.7 percent and mitigating broader declines as crude prices gained.

Exxon Mobil rose 1.3 percent to $87.85 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow and S.&P. 500, while Chevron added 0.75 percent to $102.16.

The recent “strength in crude has both lifted equity prices and also tended to assuage that fear that we are going into a season of protracted anemic consumer and global demand,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in Berkeley Heights, N.J. “Crude oil is an enormously important factor right now in the global market.”

Oil rose after a short-covering rally was triggered by comments from Saudi Arabia’s oil minister in the previous session about possible action to help stabilize the market.

Brent crude futures settled 2 percent higher at $46.97 a barrel. In the United States, crude settled up $1 at $44.49.

“The U.S. retail sales data in particular is causing the dollar to weaken,” said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.

Benchmark Treasury yields fell to their lowest in nearly two weeks after the economic data, with 10-year Treasury notes last rising 18/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 1.51 percent, from 1.56 percent on Thursday.

Analysts said that cooling consumer spending and tame inflation suggested that the Federal Reserve would probably not raise interest rates any time soon, despite a robust labor market.

1874,"The Saudis’ shift is easier to justify because price pressures have abated of late. While oil initially dipped on Thursday, it recovered to around $50 a barrel, about twice what it was in January.

Oil producers should “let the market forces continue to seek and find that equilibrium price between supply and demand,” said Mr. Falih, speaking to a small group of reporters in his penthouse hotel suite.

The Saudis can increasingly afford to go their own way. Along with a wealth of oil reserves, Saudi Arabia invested tens of billions of dollars in building a competitive oil business at a time when other OPEC countries like Venezuela and Iran allowed their industries to deteriorate.

Mr. Falih has been at the core of those moves.

Mr. Falih a 1982 graduate of Texas A&M, jumped onto the international oil scene in the early 2000s. Hoping to inject life and competition into the economy, King Abdullah, Saudi Arabia’s ruler at the time, invited overseas companies to look for natural gas after shutting them out in the 1970s.

To the surprise of Western oil executives, the king tapped Mr. Falih, then a young executive at Saudi Aramco, to manage complex negotiations for a series of joint ventures with Royal Dutch Shell of Britain, Total of France and Lukoil of Russia. Although the ventures didn’t find much gas, Mr. Falih garnered credit for deftly juggling conflicting interests.

“After a year or so, I had to accept that he was really good at what he was doing,” said Floris Ansingh, who was the head of Shell in Saudi Arabia at the time. “He understood the different trade-offs.”

Mr. Falih’s international focus set the stage for the evolution of Saudi Aramco.

After he was named chief executive of the company in 2009, he pushed for modernization, trying to turn the state-run oil company into a global competitor that rivaled the private giants in the West. He expanded areas like oil trading and acquisitions and tried to lock up demand by investing in China and in other growing economies.

Saudi Aramco has recently developed three giant oil fields, sharply increasing the amount of oil it can produce. The company earned an estimated $200 billion from oil production last year, according to the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie.

“The view in the industry is that Aramco is one of the best oil companies in the world,” said J. Robinson West, a senior adviser on energy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization. “Khalid has been important in building that.”

Mr. Falih also seems unafraid to tread on sensitive ground.

As the head of the national oil company, he warned that fast-rising domestic fuel consumption risked eroding the crude-oil exports that are the kingdom’s main source of cash.

“We need to make sure that we use our precious oil and gas resources efficiently, wisely and minimizing waste,” Mr. Falih said at a dinner in 2010.

At the time, rethinking the country’s energy use at home was a politically fraught issue. Government subsidies that kept fuel cheap were considered an untouchable piece of the Saudi social contract. And with oil prices surging back then, the kingdom’s oil wealth, it seemed, would only grow.

Now, his warning is part of the new Saudi mind-set.

“He is a very astute political player,” said Valérie Marcel, author of “Oil Titans,” a book about national oil companies. “He has been able to push back and create space to debate issues, while still keeping himself in good position with the ruler.”

Mr. Falih also recognized early on that growing concern for the climate could reduce demand for Saudi oil, creating a risk that a large portion of those resources might be left in the ground.

On Thursday, Mr. Falih said that Saudi Arabia was now preparing for the worst case by moving aggressively to spur growth of nonoil-based industries. While he said he thought that demand for crude would last for generations, Mr. Falih added that “we as human beings cannot be complacent and assume that oil will continue to fuel the world forever.”

In recent years, Mr. Falih has taken on the role of trusted confidant, serving as adviser and troubleshooter for Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In 2015, the prince put Mr. Falih in charge of the kingdom’s troubled Health Ministry, which was struggling to contain a deadly respiratory virus called MERS.

In his new role, Mr. Falih has significant oversight of a huge portion of the Saudi economy. The Oil Ministry absorbed the Ministry of Electricity and was renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources. He has also been appointed head of the government-owned mining company, a state-run industrial fund, the geological survey, the atomic and renewable energy program and a number of other state-run economic bodies.

Mr. Falih faces a huge set of objectives, some in areas where his predecessor came up short. Despite its oil wealth, the kingdom struggles to produce sufficient natural gas to meet the fast-growing needs of electricity generators and industry. Efforts to develop solar power and other renewable energy sources have also lagged some of Saudi Arabia’s neighbors, like the United Arab Emirates.

Mr. Falih is part of the plan to refocus the country’s financial firepower to invest in areas other than oil. In a sign of the shifting strategy, the kingdom, traditionally conservative in its investment approach, recently invested $3.5 billion in the ride-sharing start-up Uber. It was one of the largest investments into a privately held start-up.

Mr. Falih is also in charge of the effort to sell a small stake in Saudi Aramco to investors with a target of 2018. He said the idea was to make the company more global as it looks to add investments in natural gas.

A public listing might also improve the company’s performance.

“If you have to face the analysts every quarter,” he said, “it gives you a bit of competitive tension.”

To make it all work, Mr. Falih will have to persuade the country’s stubborn constituents to adopt a more commercial focus and to participate in joint ventures with international companies. While some doubt whether Mr. Falih is the right person to lead this transition, others say only an insider has the credibility to do so.

Either way, the oil market will be watching.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1878,"CHAIRMAN PUTS HIS BRAND ON TRIBUNE | Michael W. Ferro Jr. has been a power player in Chicago for years and since he became chairman at Tribune Publishing four months ago, he has been determined to make it known that he is in charge and no one will take that away from him.

On Thursday, he installed his close associates on the company board to make it less attractive for Gannett to pursue its unsolicited takeover offer,

Leslie Picker and Sydney Ember report in DealBook. He also changed the company’s name to ‘tronc,’ which stands for Tribune online content, and moved its stock listing to the Nasdaq to make it feel more like a dot-com-era start-up.

On the same day, a shareholder sued members of the board, including Mr. Ferro, for breaching their fiduciary duties in blocking the Gannett takeover.

Mr. Ferro is the latest wealthy businessman to think he has the right ideas to save a struggling newspaper group after Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post and Sheldon G. Adelson bought The Las Vegas Review-Journal. Tribune is not his first foray into the industry — he bought The Chicago Sun-Times through Wrapports, a company he led with Timothy P. Knight, a former publisher of Newsday. There, he emulated a Silicon Valley atmosphere, creating an arcade game room and providing free candy and ice cream. Mr. Ferro has also exhibited retro approaches to running a business, commenting publicly on women’s physical appearances.

Mr. Ferro was a tech entrepreneur until about a decade ago, He sold Click Commerce, which made software to manage supply chains, to Illinois Tool Works for about $300 million. I.T.W. had to write down the investment two years later, but the deal made him a millionaire many times over. Mr. Ferro used his status to take seats on boards across Chicago.

Mr. Ferro persuaded the likes of John Canning, who founded the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners, and Andrew McKenna, chairman of McDonald’s, to put capital into his new investment firm, Merrick Ventures.

Merrick quickly made a bet on Merge Healthcare. Mr. Ferro took a controlling stake in the company, which made medical-imaging software, and ousted the chief executive to install his own associate, Justin Dearborn — a precursor to his installment of Mr. Dearborn as chief executive at Tribune. Mr. Ferro’s stature started to fade, however, when regulators questioned Merge’s related-party transactions. Still, Merge sold to IBM for $1 billion last year — a 900 percent return for Mr. Ferro.

Now it remains to be seen whether Gannett will walk away from its offer. There could also be another twist: Mr. Ferro has indicated his own interest in buying Gannett.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1880,"“Any buyer today should understand the risks,” Aleksandr Y. Abramov, a professor of finance at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said of the latest planned resale of 51 percent of Bashneft. “In a few years, this deal, too, could be unwound for one reason or another.”

Such uncertainty is a big reason investors remain wary of Russian stocks.

Consider the differing perceptions of Brazil and Russia. Both developing countries are big commodity exporters facing serious economic headwinds. But investors are willing to pay only about half as much for a Russian company as they would for a Brazilian business with the same earnings potential, according to Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank.

Illustrative of Russia’s stock troubles is Gazprom, the state-controlled oil giant that was once the country’s biggest company. Gazprom’s market value was $52 billion on Tuesday, down from its peak in May 2008 of $367 billion.

Russia’s mighty oil, mining and industrial holdings looked like a good deal in the early 1990s during the transition from communism to capitalism. The government tried to create a society of stockholders out of the Soviet ashes by giving everyone vouchers representing shares in state-owned businesses. But the chaotically run effort largely flopped.

Hard up for money ahead of an election in 1996, President Boris N. Yeltsin tried a new tack of catering to rich insiders. He sold companies on the cheap to a new class of wealthy Russians.

After Mr. Putin assumed power on New Year’s Eve in 1999, he vowed to eliminate these oligarchs “as a class.” Three years later, police arrested Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, then Russia’s richest man as owner of the Yukos oil company, bought in the sale under Mr. Yeltsin.

The primary pumping asset became Rosneft, the state oil company. Rosneft was partly privatized; the state sold 13 percent on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.

Foreign investors have been hurt, too.

In 2006, Russian regulators forced the Western oil giant Shell to sell a 25 percent share in its valuable Sakhalin Island field after threatening to shut it down for environmental violations. The threat went away after Gazprom, the state gas giant, gained control of the field.

It was Shell’s second run-in with the Russian agenda. The company’s oil assets in the country were nationalized in 1918, and Shell was only partly compensated by the Soviet government.

Bashneft’s story is perhaps one of the most tangled.

In 1993, the Russian government transferred Bashneft to the regional government of Bashkortostan, at a time when Mr. Yeltsin was trying to curry favor with local leaders. In the early 2000s, the regional government sold shares to a company owned by local elites, Ural-Invest. In the years after, Mr. Yevtushenkov steadily picked up shares through a holding company called Sistema, in deals that were certain to have been approved by the Kremlin, according to oil analysts.

Then the government changed its mind. In 2014, prosecutors asserted that the company’s original transfer — 21 years before — to a regional government had been illegal. So all subsequent transactions were voided.

Mr. Yevtushenkov was ensnared by the flurry of criminal and civil cases that followed. His shares were handed over to the state.

Mr. Yevtushenkov was finally cleared in a ruling late last year. Sistema won $950 million in a lawsuit against the previous owner, Ural-Invest. A spokesman for Sistema declined to comment.

Russia’s view of Bashneft has changed, too. Mr. Putin in April removed Bashneft from a list of so-called strategically important companies, despite substantial proven oil reserves of 2.2 billion barrels. The move clears the way for the company’s potential sale to overseas investors.

The for-sale signs are broadly up again. Along with Bashneft, the government plans to offer shares in Sovcomflot, a shipping company; Alrosa, a diamond mining company; VTB, a state bank; and Rosneft.

Investors are already sniffing around. Russian oil companies, one run by a former chief executive of Rosneft, have announced plans to bid for Bashneft. Executives and government officials in India and China have said the countries’ energy giants are potentially interested in buying shares in Rosneft.

The government needs money to cover a portion of Russia’s projected deficit this year of 2.4 trillion rubles ($36 billion), up from 1.95 trillion rubles ($31 billion) last year. And the privatization push is one of the few ways for the government to raise money.

Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis make it difficult for Russia to hold bond sales, a common method for governments to cover budget shortfalls. While the United States Treasury has not specifically outlawed Russian bond deals, it has told American banks not to underwrite them.

At a meeting of presidential economic advisers last month, Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former minister of economy, suggested that the Kremlin spur growth by easing international tensions, as another option along with privatization. Mr. Putin responded that Russia would not “bargain with its sovereignty.”

Russia insists that the government will do better this time around with the privatization plan. Dmitry Pristanskov, head of the Federal Agency for State Property, who is overseeing the effort, said the early post-Soviet sales were partly rolled back because corruption had tainted the process.

“At the time, 25 years ago, there was no clear criteria for choosing an investor,” Mr. Pristanskov said. He said the state now carefully vetted potential buyers for criminal ties or flaws like weak compliance departments, limiting the risk that deals will fall apart later. “This is exactly what we do differently today.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1883,"United States markets fell on Friday as a drop in oil prices took shares of energy companies sharply lower. Banks were falling again as bond yields continued to shrink. The losses wiped out most of the market’s gains from earlier this week.

KEEPING SCORE At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.67 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 0.92 percent. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.29 percent.

The S.&P. 500 reached an 11-month high this week and so did oil prices, but investors remained cautious as they looked to a Federal Reserve meeting next week and Britain’s referendum on its membership in the European Union on June 23.

ENERGY United States crude oil shed $1.49 to $49.07 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, fell $1.41, or 2.71 percent, at $50.54 a barrel.

ConocoPhillips shares gave up 4.4 percent and shares of the oil field services company Schlumberger declined 1.8 percent. Chevron stock fell 0.8 percent.

BANKS STUMBLE As they did on Thursday, bank stocks fell along with bond yields. Lower bond yields drive down the interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans, and that makes them less profitable for banks. Citigroup shares sank 2.5 percent, and shares of JPMorgan Chase lost 1.4 percent. Bank of America stock fell 2.5 percent.

Bond prices rose further, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note sank to 1.64 percent from 1.69 percent.

The drop in bond yields sent shares of phone companies higher, as those stocks’ high dividend yields are comparable to bonds. Verizon Communications shares rose 1.4 percent.

DRUG PRICE DOUBTS Drug company stocks fell further. Mylan shares lost 2.7 percent after David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said the company might come under scrutiny from regulators because it made some “exceptionally large price increases” on its drugs this year. Mr. Maris said the price changes might also indicate that some of Mylan’s other products were not selling as well as it had hoped.

A number of drug companies’ shares have tumbled in recent months as regulators questioned their patterns of raising prices and other business practices. Shares of Endo International, which has plunged more than 70 percent this year, fell 8.4 percent.

CONSUMER WOES Consumer stocks also fell, with some of the sharpest losses going to big names. Shares of Amazon declined 1.34 percent, and Netflix stock dropped 3.44 percent.

OUTFITTERS FALLS Shares of the retailer Urban Outfitters slumped after the company said that sales at established stores had continued to fall in the second quarter so far. Those sales are considered an important measurement of retailer performance. The company’s stock slid 5.8 percent.

CHEMICAL DEAL The ethylene producer Westlake Chemical said it would buy the chemical maker Axiall for $33 a share, or $2.33 billion. That was a 28 percent premium to the price of Axiall shares on Thursday. Axiall stock jumped 26 percent and shares of Westlake rose 2.77 percent.

BLOCK RISES The tax preparer H&R Block posted a bigger profit and more revenue than analysts had expected, sending its stock up 12.4 percent.

TOSSING AND TURNING Mattress Firm Holding Corp., the bedding maker behind Serta, Sealy, and other brands, reported a bigger loss and less revenue than expected and cut its estimates for the year. Its stock dropped 12.5 percent.

EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX tumbled 2.5 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 lost 2.2 percent. The FTSE 100 slid 1.9 percent in Britain.

ASIA’S DAY The Nikkei 225 declined 0.4 percent in Japan, while the Kospi slipped 0.3 percent in South Korea. The Hang Seng shed 1.2 percent in Hong Kong. In Australia, the S.&P./ASX 200 lost 0.9 percent. Benchmarks in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand also fell. Markets were closed in mainland China and Taiwan for a holiday.

1884,"Two widely followed benchmarks ended higher on Tuesday, as energy shares rebounded and investor confidence rose on news that an increase in interest rates was not imminent.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained just 2.72 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,112.13, but that was its highest close since July 2015. The index is now nearly 19 points shy of its closing high of 2,130.82.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 17.95 points, or 0.1 percent, at 17,938.28, after exceeding 18,000.

The Nasdaq composite index ended lower, however. Biotech shares dropped after disappointing news from several major companies, including Biogen. The Nasdaq dipped 6.96 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,961.75. The Nasdaq biotech index was down 2.5 percent.

“With the industry projecting a decline in total U.S. crude oil stocks in this week’s reports, the market bears are remaining on the sidelines,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.

Worries over potential supply shortages from attacks on Nigeria’s oil industry helped raise oil prices, as did expectations of a probable decline in American crude stocks, the third in three weeks.

The price of oil has nearly doubled since January, helped largely by unplanned failures that have eroded production in Canada, Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria, along with a steady decline in higher-cost shale output in the United States.

Comments by Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, on Monday also seemed to ease some worries about the economy, while underscoring the view that the Fed may be in no rush to raise rates.

“The big story for the market right now is, Do we break out to all-time highs?” said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at Northstar Wealth Partners in West Hartford, Conn.

“If we do so in the near term, we could see a rush of money jump into the market from investors who had been sitting out on the sidelines, in fear of missing out on further market gains.”

Biogen tumbled 12.8 percent to $252.86 after its multiple sclerosis drug failed in a midstage study.

By just about any measure, the movement to battle climate change has grown so large that the truths of Al Gore’s decade-old movie now seem more mainstream than inconvenient.

In Paris in December, 195 nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gases. In the United States, 70 percent of Americans say that climate change is real. Pope Francis has joined the call for action. Hundreds of thousands of people have come together for climate marches in Paris and New York, and demonstrators recently held fossil-fuel protests on six continents.

“That’s what I call momentum,” Daniel R. Tishman, the chairman of the board of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in its recent annual report. “This isn’t just the wind at our backs; these are the winds of change.”

But the movement that started with a straightforward mission — to get more people to appreciate the dangers of climate change as a precursor to action — is feeling growing pains. What may seem like a unified front has pronounced schisms, with conflicting opinions on many issues, including nuclear power and natural gas, that are complicating what it means to be an environmentalist in this day and age.

The factional boundaries are not hard and fast, with groups shifting their positions as the science and waves of activism evolve. The environmental movement has always been a congregation of many voices, and some disagreement should be expected on such complex and intractable problems as saving the planet. Still, the tensions remain strong.

Consider some of the biggest points of contention:

Nuclear power

There are sharp disagreements over whether nuclear plants should be part of the energy mix to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Disasters like that at the Fukushima plant in Japan have undercut confidence in the technology, but it remains attractive to the Obama administration and many in the environmental movement, including James E. Hansen, a retired NASA climate scientist.

Supporters argue that nuclear plants can produce enormous amounts of power without the carbon dioxide that burning coal and natural gas produce. They also point out that the energy sources replacing existing plants tend to come from natural gas, causing greenhouse emissions. That was the case in New England when the Vermont Yankee plant was shut down, and in California after the closing of the plant at San Onofre.

California has decided to wind down the Diablo Canyon reactors by 2025, a lengthy transition that could allow a buildup of renewable energy sources to replace the lost power. The nuclear power debate extends to questions of whether to develop a new generation of plants that supporters say would be less expensive and safer, or whether to extend the lives of existing plants.

More Reporting on Climate Change

Opponents of nuclear energy argue that the move to renewable energy sources would not require a new generation of nuclear plants. Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian who has written about the tactics of those who spread doubt about climate change, said proponents of nuclear power had not proved that the risks of operating the plants, and the waste they produce, could be managed.

“We all agree that there is urgency to this matter,” she said in an email interview. “So do we really want to bet the planet (literally) on a technology with such a bad track record? And that even when it works takes decades to build?”

She has called the pronuclear arguments from environmentalists “a new, strange form of denial,” pointedly using a word associated with those who have disputed the validity of climate science itself.

Natural gas

Burning natural gas produces less carbon dioxide and smog-producing pollutants than burning coal, so environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and even President Obama once praised it as a “bridge” to renewable fuels: that natural gas plants could replace coal plants until alternate sources like solar and wind power could take over.

More recently, however, the environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is used to extract fossil fuels, and growing worries about the greenhouse gas methane, which often leaks when natural gas is produced and transported, have led many scientists and activists to call natural gas a “bridge to nowhere.” (The Sierra Club now has a “Beyond Natural Gas” campaign.)

Climate campaigners like Bill McKibben have argued that the potency of methane as a greenhouse gas, especially in the short term, might make it worse than coal. He calls this “the terrifying chemistry” of warming, though others have disputed his interpretation of the science.

Mr. McKibben has described those who favor natural gas as a way to reduce greenhouse emissions as believers in “painless environmentalism, the equivalent of losing weight by cutting your hair.”

The fight has made its way into the Democratic campaign for the presidency: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a national ban on fracking, while Hillary Clinton has suggested that the technology should be carefully regulated and that, if natural gas is a bridge to alternate energy sources, “we want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible.” Those putting together the Democratic Party platform narrowly rejected the call for a ban.

Fossil-fuel companies

Two distinct camps have emerged on the best strategy for dealing with companies like Exxon Mobil. One camp wants to attack their very existence, and to hurt their businesses and reputations as a way of accelerating the transition to renewable technologies like wind and solar.

Universities and institutional shareholders like pensions and church endowments are being pressed to sell their stock in fossil-fuel companies, to fight projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and to disrupt construction of fossil-fuel facilities.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1903,"MARKET PANIC SUBSIDES AS BRITAIN FACES ECONOMIC FEARS | Markets regained some equilibrium in Asia on Tuesday with the pound clawing back some of its losses and the Nikkei 225 rising in Japan, Jonathan Soble reports in DealBook.

The Japanese authorities sought to prevent the strengthening of the yen, which could be bad for profits and deflation. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said that the authorities were ready to respond if necessary.

A measure of calm had appeared already on Monday, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Stocks slid, but Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was stable for most of the day after dropping around 2 percent in the first minutes of trading. It closed 1.8 percent lower, while markets in Japan and China finished higher.

The VIX measure of volatility fell on Monday after a spike on Friday.

Europe was less sanguine with investors still dumping stocks and seeking safety in bonds and gold. The pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar since the 1980s and Standard & Poor’s rating agency announced that it was stripping Britain of its AAA rating.

There is still enormous uncertainty about how Britain’s exit will play out, but if you consider the absolute worst-case scenarios, it could just be the first domino, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in DealBook. And the next ones to fall would matter more.

Italy’s government is already considering pumping money into its banking systems as bank stocks were pummelled after the vote. Italy’s banks would suffer if Britain’s vote to leave the European Union created a material economic slowdown. If Italy’s economy faltered later on and the European Union offered help only with tough conditions, we could witness the secession of Italy, Mr. Sorkin writes.

There is a decent chance that another country could try to follow Britain on its way out before then. Geert Wilders, the populist leader of the anti-immigrant Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, has already called for a Dutch referendum.

James Pethokoukis, a commentator at the American Enterprise Institute, recently found a memorandum written in 2011 during the euro crisis by Willem Buiter, the global chief economist at Citigroup, that imagined the destruction of the European Union. It compared it to the movie “War of the Roses” — disruptive, destructive and without any winners.

“Exit, partial or full, would likely be precipitated by disorderly sovereign defaults in the fiscally weak and uncompetitive member states, whose currencies would weaken dramatically and whose banks would fail,” Mr. Buiter wrote at the time. “If Spain and Italy were to exit, there would be a collapse of systemically important financial institutions throughout the European Union and North America and years of global depression.”

Hopefully, these are just worst-case scenarios. Unfortunately, as Neil Irwin explains in The Upshot, Britain’s exit actually accentuates global forces that have been building for years that governments have been unable to limit.

These self-reinforcing dimensions make it a particularly perilous time for the global economy. The dollar is likely to strengthen with the value of the pound collapsing. The result of the referendum could drag down growth even further.

And political environments around the world are getting more toxic, driving greater polarization and a greater range of possible outcomes. These and other changes do not stand in isolation, and no one yet knows where the cycle ends.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1907,"But another measure to raise prices and affect consumer behavior has long been favored by a broad consensus of economists. That is a national tax on carbon or, more narrowly, a booster tax on oil or gasoline — all of which have been opposed by Congress. On Friday, the House of Representatives voted, largely along party lines, against both a carbon tax and a tax on oil.

Nonetheless, a broad carbon tax or a narrower gasoline tax surcharge would generate revenue that could go toward neglected infrastructure, like bridges, tunnels, trains and subways, or toward improvement of renewable energy sources, reducing dependence on fossil fuels directly. But it could also be used to offset cuts in other taxes, as proposed in Washington State. Either method could make gasoline, and other forms of carbon, expensive enough to make people think twice before burning it.

There is evidence that when prices drop, as they did over the last few years, people shift to bigger, less-fuel-efficient cars. In the recent low-price gas world, I’ve found myself dreaming about replacing my miserly compact — a little Subaru Impreza — with a more generously sized model, one with enough space for skis and boots and boxes and luggage and other assorted pieces of paraphernalia that I might want to cram into the vehicle one day.

I don’t think that way when gas prices are high, as they were until fairly recently. Recall that a gallon of regular cost more than $3 two years ago, and more than $4 in 2008.

Those high gas prices contributed to a virtuous cycle in consumer behavior, according to statistics provided by Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.

Here are a few important numbers.

Fuel economy rose fairly steadily to 25.8 miles per gallon in August 2014 from 20.1 m.p.g. in October 2007. (Those figures are for newly purchased light-duty vehicles — cars, light trucks and sport utility vehicles.) Then, based on Environmental Protection Agency ratings, fuel economy of new vehicles reversed course, as I lamented in a column in December. It dropped as low as 25 miles a gallon that month, as gasoline prices plunged below $2 a gallon.

But as gas prices rise, people are shifting back toward more environmentally friendly models. This fuel economy measure rose to 25.4 miles per gallon in May — up 0.2 miles per gallon in one month. In an email, Mr. Sivak said, “The improvement likely reflects the increased price of gasoline in May, and the consequent increased interest in more fuel-efficient vehicles by buyers of all vehicle classes.”

How you view these current fuel economy levels depends on your point of comparison, he observed. It is “down 0.4 m.p.g. from the peak reached in August 2014, but still up 5.3 m.p.g. since October 2007,” when his institute began compiling this statistic.

In short, when gas is really cheap, Americans are likely to buy less fuel-efficient vehicles and drive more, which we’ve already seen happen.

Higher fuel prices tend to make vehicles like electric cars, hybrids and smaller, gas-sipping internal combustion engine vehicles more appealing. In a separate study, Mr. Sivak and Brandon Schoettle, a project manager at the institute, calculated that a major improvement in the fuel efficiency of the nation’s light vehicles, including old and new vehicles, to 56 miles per gallon from 21.4 miles per gallon today, would, by itself, reduce total fuel emissions in the United States 10 percent.

Big as that change would be, it would not be enough to meet the goals of last December’s Paris agreement on climate change, which would commit nearly every country in the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consider that President Obama has pledged that the United States will cut total emissions 26 to 28 percent by 2025. Emissions from many sources, particularly those from coal-fired power plants, would need to be reduced, though the Supreme Court put some of those regulations into a state of limbo with a decision in February. Further legal challenges are underway.

In the meantime, gasoline prices are inching higher. Adding a modest gasoline tax of, say, 25 cents a gallon — or a more ambitious carbon tax — would magnify and consolidate that upward trend.

Given opposition in Congress, it is unrealistic to imagine that either kind of national tax will be enacted right now. Bernie Sanders was the lone major presidential candidate in the race in June to have called for a carbon tax, according to an assessment by PolitiFact. Yet such a tax, or a variation favored by President Obama known as “cap and trade,” makes eminent sense, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have concluded.

One problem with such taxes — aside from the glaring fact that taxes are generally unpopular — is that they tend to be regressive. A gasoline tax, for example, burdens low-wage people who must drive to work, but tax credits aimed at low-income car commuters could offset this.

Taxes and prices affect behavior in fairly predictable ways.

1911,"CAMARILLO, Calif. — The average price of gasoline in the U.S. has dropped six cents over the past two weeks to $2.16 a gallon for regular grade, industry analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.

A drop in crude oil prices has driven a nine-week decline in costs at the pump, but those prices have strengthened in the past week and retail price drops are likely to be smaller or cease, Lundberg said.

The price has dropped 21 cents since a peak June 3. The average price is 55 cents lower than a year ago.

The Lundberg Survey found the average price of midgrade unleaded was $2.46 a gallon, and premium was $2.67.

The highest average price for regular gas in the contiguous U.S. was $2.70 a gallon in San Diego. The lowest was $1.81 in Jackson, Mississippi.

The U.S. average diesel price is $2.35 per gallon, down four cents from two weeks ago.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1919,"(Reuters) - SM Energy Co said on Monday it would pay more than $980 million (751 million pounds) to double its holdings in the prolific Permian Basin in Texas, showing that some oil producers are still willing to spend big on good assets.

The deal to buy Rock Oil Holdings LLC from private equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC will give SM Energy 24,783 acres in Howard County. SM Energy already has about 20,000 acres in the Permian Basin.

The assets being bought, which produce 4,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) on a net basis, are in a region of the basin that is emerging as a top-tier area, SM Energy Chief Executive Jay Ottoson said in a statement.

""We like SM broadening its footprint in our favourite Permian Basin, but the acreage valuation looks lofty at this price,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email to Reuters.

SM Energy's shares rose as much as 11 percent before easing back to be up 5.9 percent at $31.03 in afternoon trading.

A more-than 60 percent fall in oil prices since mid-2014 has prompted oil producers to move crews and high-speed rigs to ""sweet spots"" with the most oil.

The average price per acre in the Permian Basin has risen over the past few months, given promising well results, said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Chris Stevens.

Diamondback Energy Inc said last week that two wells in its first three-well pad in Howard County had initial production rates of more than 1,200 boe/d.

Adjusted for production, SM Energy is paying Riverstone about $31,500 per acre, higher than the $20,000 per acre Callon Petroleum Co paid in a recent deal, said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

Callon Petroleum said in April it would spend about $220 million to buy acreage, primarily in Howard County.

SM Energy said it was offering 15 million shares and $100 million in unsecured convertible notes to fund the deal.

The company, which increased its 2016 capital budget by $15 million-$20 million from its earlier estimate of $670 million, said it expected to add one rig in the Permian Basin in the fourth quarter and two more in 2017. SM Energy is currently running two rigs in the Permian Basin.

Jefferies and Petrie Partners advised Rock Oil on the deal.

1920,"KUWAIT CITY — Kuwait will raise its subsidized gasoline prices by as much as 83 percent beginning in September, becoming the last Gulf nation to do so as low global oil prices continue to gnaw away at governments across the region.

Kuwait's Cabinet announced the decision on Monday, with the biggest price hike coming for its premium-grade gasoline.

As of Sept. 1, that octane will cost 165 fils a liter (53 cents) instead of 90 fils (30 cents). That's 624 fils ($2.05) a gallon as opposed to 340 fils ($1.12) a gallon previously.

Kuwait's cheapest gasoline will increase in price by 41 percent from 60 fils (20 cents) a liter to 85 fils (26 cents). Its mid-range fuel will go up by 61 percent, from 65 fils (21 cents) to 105 fils (35 cents). That puts the new prices at 321 fils ($1.06) a gallon for the cheapest fuel and 397 fils ($1.30) a gallon for mid-range.

1927,"FRANKFURT/HONG KONG — British oil major BP is seeking buyers for its 50 percent stake in Chinese petrochemicals joint venture SECCO, its largest investment in China, in a deal sources said could fetch $2-$3 billion.

State-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec), which owns the other half of the venture and has a right of first refusal, said it was discussing the conditions put forward by BP, but has made no decision.

BP is working with Morgan Stanley to sell its shareholding in the SECCO venture as part of a drive to cash out of businesses where it lacks control, three sources familiar with the matter said. A successful deal would mark BP's first significant exit from a business in China.

Situated in Caojing near Shanghai, SECCO is China's largest petrochemicals refinery and was built at a cost of $2.7 billion, according to BP's website.

BP shares were up 1.1 percent in morning trade, outpacing a 0.3 percent rise in the FTSE index, as investors digested news that would bolster its cash position and underpin dividends. Sinopec's Shanghai-listed shares were up 1 percent, slightly outperforming the broader China market.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A London-based BP spokesman declined to comment. Morgan Stanley was not available for immediate comment.

SECCO, a venture formed in 2001, produces ethylene and propylene, which are used to make resins, plastics and synthetic rubbers.

Bankers said Chinese state enterprises were unlikely to step in to buy the stake as executives at many of them are distracted by anti-corruption probes.

BP's stake has been marketed to existing refinery operators in China, including companies from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Europe, the sources added.

Bankers said the stake would also attract interest from Chinese private firms stepping up their presence in petrochemicals.

""Even in this low oil price environment, this is one auction that will attract a lot of demand. With most SOEs going slow on M&A, Chinese private enterprises will be active,"" one Asia-based oil and gas banker said.

The refining and chemicals businesses have been a bright spot for M&A in the oil sector since the sharp drop in oil prices more than two years ago. Lower oil prices have boosted refining profits and demand for oil products around the world.

BP, like other global oil and gas companies, has been sharpening its focus on costs and core businesses as it reels from lower oil prices. U.S. rival Chevron and Britain's BG Group have also recently sold stakes in Asian ventures as they return their focus to their core home markets.

BP has sold more than $50 billion of assets since the deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill in order to pay for clean-up costs and legal bills. This year, it plans to offload between $3 billion and $5 billion worth of assets, of which $1.9 billion has been agreed, it said when releasing second-quarter earnings last month.

1929,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. trade deficit increased to the highest point in 10 months, driven up by a big rise in imports of oil and Chinese-made computers, cell phones and clothing.

The deficit rose to $44.5 billion in June, 8.7 percent higher than a revised May deficit of $41 billion, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the biggest gap between what America sells abroad and what the country imports since a $44.6 billion deficit last August.

Exports, which have struggled this year because of the strong dollar and global weakness, edged up 0.3 percent to $183.2 billion. Imports rose a faster 1.9 percent to $227.7 billion, led by a 19.4 percent jump in petroleum imports.

The politically sensitive deficit with China increased to $29.8 billion, the highest in seven months.

A wider U.S. trade deficit acts as a drag on growth because it means the nation is earning less on overseas sales of U.S. exports while spending more on imported products.

America's deficit with China was up 2.5 percent to the highest level since a deficit of $31.3 billion last November. Through the first six months of this year, the deficit with China, the largest with any country, is running 6.5 percent above the same period in 2015, putting it on track to set another annual record.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, seeking to tap into the economic anxiety of Americans who have seen jobs disappear in an increasingly global economy, has accused the Obama administration of failing to protect U.S. workers from unfair trade practices in China and other countries.

Trump has said he would exit from the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico if it were not renegotiated, kill the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and take a more aggressive approach with China, including charging the country as a currency manipulator.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, normally an ally of Republicans on trade, contends that Trump's approach would cost 3.5 million U.S. jobs and result in higher prices for American consumers and a weaker economy.

Through the first six months of this year, the deficit is 2.3 percent below the same period in 2015, a year in which America's deficit in goods and services trade rose 2.1 percent to $500.4 billion. The lower deficit so far this year reflects the fact that while U.S. exports are down, the value of imports is down by a larger amount, reflecting in large part lower oil prices.

While oil prices plunged at the beginning of the year, they have been rebounding more recently. In June, America's foreign oil bill rose 19.4 percent to $13.3 billion as the average price of a barrel of imported crude oil climbed to $39.38. The per barrel increase of $5.19 from the May level was the biggest one-month price gain since May 2011 and marked the fourth straight month that crude oil has risen in price.

America's deficit with the European Union fell 3.9 percent to $12.8 billion in June, the month that Britain sent financial markets tumbling with voters' support for a British exit from the EU. U.S. markets quickly regained those losses and economists do not expect a large impact on the U.S. economy from Britain's decision to leave the EU.

The U.S. deficit with Canada increased to $300 million, up from $100 million in May, even though U.S. exports to Canada rose to the highest level in a year.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

1933,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services firm Amec Foster Wheeler Plc reported revenue and trading profit above consensus estimates compiled by it, and said it continued streamlining operations to insulate itself from the impact of the oil price slump.

The company's trading result forecast for the full year remained unchanged, said Chief Executive Jonathan Lewis, who assumed office in June and initiated a review of its strategy and organisation structure.

Shares in the company rose 8.5 percent to 506 pence at 0821 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.

Crude oil prices have fallen more than 60 percent since mid-2014 due to oversupplied markets. Oil and gas companies have in response slashed costs and delayed projects to weather weak oil prices, resulting in lower demand for oilfield services.

The London-based provider of engineering and construction services to oilfields reported a pretax loss of 446 million pounds in the six months ended June 30, compared with a pretax profit of 73 million pounds a year earlier.

Amec said asset write-offs and impairment charges accounted for 371 million pounds out of 440 million pounds in total non-cash impairment charges for the first half of the year.

Excluding the changes, Amec's trading profit stood at 177 million pounds, above the company's consensus of 158 million pounds, Amec said.

Revenue from continuing operations rose 7 percent to 2.84 billion pounds, beating company-provided consensus estimate of 2.54 billion pounds, based on data from 13 analysts.

1936,"NEW YORK — Investors in junk-rated energy bonds, who have made a mint this year betting on this battered sector, are paring their holdings as oil flirts with sub-$40-a-barrel levels on concerns about a persistent overhang in supply and choppy demand.

Thanks to the two-year slump in the price of oil, energy debt securities yielded a whopping 21 percent in February when crude hit its lowest in over a decade at about $26. That brought in opportunistic buyers who watched prices rise, pushing yields to around 9.5 percent now, a level that these investors see as overvalued relative to oil's weakening price.

Energy debt prices have managed to continue to rally even as the price of oil headed lower in July, as investors believed that the bankruptcies that resulted from the two-year slump were largely behind the market.

U.S. crude futures <CLc1> settled on Tuesday below $40 for the first time since April, on heightened worries of a crude glut despite peak summer fuel demand. Oil lost nearly 15 percent in July, the biggest monthly loss in a year, triggering liquidation among bond investors.

Other bond investors who benefited from the recent risk-on rally in energy debt are paring holdings, viewing the massive run-up as an opportunity to take profits.

""We're neutral on energy bonds,"" said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees $1.5 trillion in assets. He said the firm is ""cautious after their huge run,"" having moved to an underweight position in their high-yield holdings.

The BofA Merrill Lynch (BAML) U.S. High Yield Energy Index posted a return of 26.7 percent from the start of the year through mid-July. Since then, though, the index is slipping, having dropped for 11 days straight, shedding about 3 percent in that period.

About 50 percent of the weight of this index is in double-B bonds, the highest-rated of junk debt. Those spreads are at 4.82 percentage points above comparable Treasury debt, yielding about 6 percent.

While still junk-rated, these securities reflect the lowest probabilities of default. Given that oil has dropped more than 20 percent from its June 9 peak, investors are finding it difficult to argue for real value for those bonds.

""You obviously regret the performance you missed, but a lot of these names are struggling and will continue to struggle,"" said Gregory Peters, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income with more than $621 billion of assets. Prudential has some energy names but well under the index amount.

The BAML high-yield strategy team recommends a modestly overweight positioning in energy and within the sector, have an overweight target for exploration and production companies.

S&P Global Ratings in May said it expects corporate defaults to keep rising, dominated by energy companies. Between the start of 2015 and March 2016, the energy sector accounted for half of all corporate debt defaults in the United States.

Given expectations for continued low prices for oil and natural gas in 2016, this sector is expected by S&P Global Ratings to continue to dominate the default total, with the high likelihood of its proportion growing throughout the year.

One factor that has kept some investors positive on high-yield bonds is the notion that the current slump is not fully reflective of the fundamentals of oil.

While crude prices have been pressured by resurgent output and a glut in refined products, some analysts believe global supply and demand are roughly balanced, driven by steady declines in U.S. production.

Daniel Loeb's $16 billion Third Point LLC said that the bottom in oil was earlier this year. Last week, Third Point said its investments in energy credits drove positive returns during the first half of the year and it is devoting over $1 billion to energy corporate credits.

Third Point said it is currently focused on debt of ""companies with high-quality assets and deleveraging catalysts where we can make good returns while limiting downside risk should commodity prices stagnate.""

Societe Generale oil analyst Michael Wittner said he expects crude prices to bottom out in the high $30 range.

""We do not think that we will return to $35 or $30 or $26-27, as we saw in Q1 16,"" he said in a note.

1946,"(Reuters) - Temporary power provider Aggreko said oil prices needed to be higher for longer to drive a recovery in its business with North American oil and gas customers, as it posted first-half profits that missed some analysts' forecasts.

While crude prices have recovered from January lows, Aggreko CEO Chris Weston said North American shale companies were so far largely restarting projects by using power grids rather than the sort of temporary supplies provided by his company.

""The oil price needs to be a little bit higher and higher for a reasonable period of time, 3-6 months, before you begin to see more drilling and production activity in areas where there is no power and therefore they need our services,"" he told reporters on Wednesday.

The world's largest listed temporary power provider posted a trading profit of 77 million pounds for the six months ended June 30, which two analysts said was below the consensus estimate of around 85 million pounds.

Aggreko shares fell as much as 15 percent, the biggest percentage fall on London's FTSE midcap index.

Citing North America weakness and geopolitical tensions in other markets, Aggreko reiterated full-year pretax profit before exceptional items would be slightly lower than in 2015. The forecast banks on Aggreko winning extensions on contracts in Argentina, Venezuela and Yemen.

Jefferies analysts said the guidance looked a stretch given it factored in an uptick in North America as well as success on all three contracts.

Aggreko was not expecting to deploy any power for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this year, Weston said, after it withdrew from the tender process to supply generators in December.

The company also said it had not yet engaged with the UK government over Britain's potential power needs after Prime Minister Theresa May decided to review plans to build a nuclear plant in southwest England.

""Of course, if the crunch came and they needed power quickly we would respond,"" Weston said.

1947,"In and around West 57th Street, known as Billionaires’ Row, “it’s not just slow — it’s come to a complete halt,” said Dolly Lenz, a broker to the superrich. She attributed the lack of activity along the Midtown corridor to oversupply, little differentiation among glassy ultraluxury units and peak pricing. “That’s a death knell,” she said.

New York is not alone. After the global financial crisis hit in 2008, investors turned to high-end real estate around the world as a safe place to park their millions. But since the middle of 2014, prime property values have dropped in Paris, Singapore, London, Moscow and Dubai, said Yolande Barnes, director of world research at Savills, a global real estate firm. “These cities have acted as a store of wealth,” said Ms. Barnes, who sees the current decline in values as “an inevitable setback that you get after a long bull run.”

Though the market still has a long way to go before fire-sale pricing sets in, the declines may indicate that a ceiling has been reached. And even as sales over $10 million drop off in Manhattan, the bulk of the market remains robust, with competition particularly heated for homes priced for less than $3 million.

In the first half of the year, contracts signed for Manhattan residences costing $10 million or more dropped by about 18 percent, to 107 units, down from 130 a year ago, according to data compiled by Olshan Realty.

In the Miami area, 216 homes and condos priced at $10 million were on the market at the end of June, a 43 percent jump from a year ago, according to data compiled by Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors. “By anyone’s measurement, that’s more than you’d like to have,” said Ron Shuffield, president of that firm, pointing out that only 26 houses and condos in that price range sold in the 12 months through June.

“The global misperception was that the demand would be endless,” said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal firm. “The reality was the market was not as deep as what was thought.”

As supply has overtaken demand, prices of luxury properties have fallen. Last month, after more than three years on the market, the crystal-bedecked penthouse at the Baccarat Hotel & Residences on West 53rd Street in Manhattan sold for $42.55 million — 29 percent less than the original $60 million asking price.

Extell Development Company, which is still selling units at One57 four years after beginning sales, reduced the projected sellout value of the tower to $2.56 billion in March, a markdown of $162 million from its 2013 projections.

Developers who cling to their original asking prices are either rejiggering their product or casting a wider net to reach buyers. At the Woolworth Building in downtown Manhattan, where the top floors are being converted to condos, ornate interiors are being toned down in favor of a more contemporary look to appeal to a wider pool of buyers.

To find buyers for Le Palais Royal, a $159 million mansion in Hillsboro Beach, Fla., that has $7 million worth of 22-karat gold leaf and a 27-foot waterfall, Joseph Leone, the developer, has flown to London, Los Angeles, Dubai and Singapore to put together a team of brokers to sell the property rather than hiring just one firm. “I believe clients are looking for something unique,” Mr. Leone said. “They are still here, but you need to change your strategy. You need to be creative.”

While prices at the high end continue to set records, that’s largely because many of the deals that are closing now involve contracts that were signed as long as 18 months ago, when many of the buildings were still under construction and the market was stronger.

Developers insist that sales at the top are continuing, just at a slower pace than in recent years.

“There is still very good activity,” said Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, “but it’s hard to close deals because people are not in a rush.” To help attract buyers to an unsold $20.1 million, three-bedroom apartment on the 45th floor of One57, Extell hired the designer Jennifer Post to decorate it at an estimated cost of $1 million.

“Unless you give them a real imperative to buy,” Mr. Barnett said, “they think, ‘I can come back in a month and it will still be there or maybe the price will be lower.’ That’s why we’re doing these things, to get these deals closed.”

Mr. Miller of Miller Samuel was less optimistic.

“It takes a while for sellers, whether in new development or resales, to capitulate to sudden changes in the market,” he said. “It’s not that there aren’t any buyers at this level. It’s that there aren’t buyers willing to pay 2014 prices.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
1948,"SEOUL, South Korea — Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday as ahead of the Bank of England's upcoming announcement of its monetary policy decision. Oil prices extended gains.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.4 percent to 16,020.15 and China's Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.6 percent to 2,960.07. But South Korea's Kospi added 0.2 percent to 1,998.51 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.3 percent to 21,812.79. Stocks in Taiwan were lower but stock markets in Singapore and Indonesia were higher.

UK WATCH: Bank of England is widely expected to unveil stimulus measures including a rate cut when it announces its monetary policy decision later Thursday after Asian markets close. Some analysts also expect the bank will announce the creation of billions in new money as early indicators since the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union suggest that the economy is contracting at its sharpest rate since 2009. Analysts expected increased volatility in the foreign exchange market ahead of the decision.

ANALYST'S TAKE: ""The question is, not so much, if the BoE will ease policy, but rather how the BoE will choose to deliver policy easing,"" Mizuho Bank wrote in a daily commentary. If the bank's decision falls short of market expectations, ""there is a risk of markets being disappointed.""

WALL STREET: U.S. stocks edged higher on Wednesday as the big gains in the price of oil boosted energy companies. The Dow Jones industrial average broke a seven-day losing streak and added 0.2 percent to 18,355. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 0.3 percent to 2,163.79. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4 percent to 5,159.74.

OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude climbed 27 cents to $41.10 per barrel in New York. The contract jumped $1.32, or 3.3 percent, to close at $40.83 on Wednesday after the U.S. government said stockpiles of gasoline shrank by more than 3 million barrels last week. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, rose 25 cents to $43.35 a barrel in London.

1952,"WASHINGTON, Aug 5 — The U.S. trade deficit rose to a 10-month high in June as rising domestic demand and higher oil prices boosted the import bill while the lagging effects of a strong dollar continued to hamper export growth.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap increased 8.7 percent to $44.5 billion in June, the biggest deficit since August 2015. May's trade deficit was revised slightly down to $41.0 billion.

June marked the third straight month of increases in the deficit. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to $43.1 billion in June after a previously reported $41.1 billion shortfall. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit rose to $64.7 billion from $60.9 billion in May.

The government in its snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product published last week said trade had contributed two-tenths of a percentage point to the 1.2 percent annualized growth pace during the period.

The dollar's sharp rally against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015 has undercut export growth.

With the dollar weakening this year on a trade-weighted basis, some of the drag on exports had started to ebb. But the dollar has been regaining strength in the wake of Britain's June 23 vote to leave the European Union, and economists say that could renew pressure on exports.

Exports of goods and services edged up 0.3 percent in June.

Exports to the European Union jumped 7.8 percent, with goods shipped to the United Kingdom soaring 18.2 percent. China bought more U.S.-made goods in June, with exports to that country rising 3.6 percent.

Imports of goods and services increased 1.9 percent to $227.7 billion in June, with oil prices accounting for part of the rise. Oil prices averaged $39.38 per barrel in June, the highest level since October of last year, from $34.19 in May.

The $5.19 increase in the average oil price in June from May was the biggest since May 2011.

June's increase in imports also reflected a pickup in domestic demand. Imports from China increased 2.8 percent. With imports outpacing exports, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 2.5 percent to $29.8 billion in June, the biggest gap since last November.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
1953,"WASHINGTON — U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in July on declining costs for services and energy products, pointing to a tame inflation environment that could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

The Labor Department said on Friday its producer price index for final demand dropped 0.4 percent last month, the first decline since March and the largest since September 2015. It increased 0.5 percent in June.

In the 12 months through July, the PPI slipped 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in the 12 months through June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and gaining 0.2 percent from a year ago.

A strong dollar and cheaper oil continue to keep price pressures muted, leaving inflation running persistently below the Fed's 2 percent target.

Last month, energy prices fell 1.0 percent after jumping 4.1 percent in June. Prices for services fell 0.3 percent, with apparel, jewelry, footwear and accessories retailing accounting for nearly 60 percent of the drop.

Services rose 0.4 percent in June. Healthcare costs increased 0.3 percent last month, with prices of doctor visits, dental and hospital outpatient care rising. Healthcare costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged last month after rising 0.3 percent in June.

The so-called core PPI was up 0.8 percent in the 12 months through July. It increased 0.9 percent in the 12 months through June.

1959,"NEW YORK — Soft U.S. economic data weighed on the dollar and Treasury yields on Friday and pressured stock prices, but Wall Street's losses were mitigated by continued gains in oil prices and the Nasdaq inched up for a second straight record high.

Short covering helped extend the rally in oil prices, which tallied their biggest weekly advance since April.

U.S. retail sales were unexpectedly flat in July as Americans cut back on purchases of clothing and other goods, while other data showed producer prices recorded their biggest drop in nearly a year in July.

1962,"NAIROBI — South Sudan's inflation more than doubled in July to reach an annual rate of 661.3 percent, its statistics office said on Monday, as the economy of the 5-year old nation continued to reel amid civil conflict.

The National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement that inflation jumped from 309.6 percent a month earlier due to rising food and non-alcoholic drinks prices. Prices rose 77.7 percent month-on-month in July.

Oil-producing South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011 but in December 2013 slid into a two-year civil war after a dispute between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar.

The economy has been battered, driving prices higher.

In June, U.N. agencies said up to 4.8 million people in South Sudan face severe food shortages, the highest level since a conflict began.

1963,"LONDON — Hedge fund Balyasny Asset Management (BAM) is closing a $250 million ""discretionary"" portfolio run by Torbjorn Andreassen who is leaving the firm, a source told Reuters on Thursday.

BAM manages a total of $12 billion, primarily in its Atlas Global fund, and allocates some of this cash to teams of underlying portfolio managers such as Andreassen, who had been with the hedge fund in London for almost two years.

The firm, which was founded in 2001 by Dimitry Balyasny, is now turning its attention to hiring a new team of traders who will focus on pure ""machine-driven"" investing, rather than Andreassen's discretionary strategy which involves plugging trade ideas into a computer which it then executes.

Andreassen left after BAM opted to focus on pure ""quant"" strategies, alongside its core fundamental stock-picking, the source said. BAM did not respond to requests for comment.

Hedge funds based on systematic trading programmes, driven in whole or partially by a computer, have outperformed rivals this year after many made money on an oil price fall and Britain's EU referendum.

That has helped assets in systematic hedge funds to grow to $270 billion as of June 30, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed.

1971,"Stocks on Wall Street recovered from a late-afternoon slide to eke out small gains on Tuesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite to its second record close in less than a week.

The three major stock indexes, all of which set new highs last Friday, rebounded from a slight decline on Monday.

Investors focused on the latest batch of company earnings, bidding up health care, telecommunications and consumer-focused companies most.

The Nasdaq composite index gained 12.34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,225.48. That’s up less than 0.1 percent from its most recent high last Friday.

Energy was the biggest laggard, as crude oil prices closed lower, backtracking after an early rally. Traders also sold off shares in department store chains after Gap reported lower sales figures.

For the year, the Dow is now up 6.4 percent, while the S.&P. is up 6.7 percent and the Nasdaq is up 4.4 percent.

On Tuesday, stocks in the United States got some help early on from a rally in European markets and in Asia, where most of the indexes closed higher.

Data out of China showing that consumer price growth declined in July for the third month in a row helped fuel expectations among investors that Beijing would pump out more stimulus in a bid to soften the slowdown in its economy, the world’s second-largest after the United States.

On Wall Street, traders bid up shares in several companies that posted strong quarterly results.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals surged 25.4 percent after the Canadian drug maker reaffirmed its earnings outlook for the year, despite reporting a wider second-quarter loss. The company said it was undergoing a restructuring.

Retailers didn’t fare as well.

Gap sank 6.2 percent after reporting lower sales in the second quarter and in July. Kohl’s also fell, shedding 4.2 percent, and Target slid 3.2 percent.

The home furnishings store Wayfair slumped 19.6 percent after posting a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter.

An early rally in United States crude oil prices evaporated. Benchmark crude fell 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $42.77 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid 39 cents, or 0.9 percent, to close at $45 a barrel in London.

The slide in oil weighed on several oil and gas companies. NRG Energy fell 5.1 percent, while Southwestern Energy shed 3.6 percent. Chesapeake Energy also declined 4 percent.

The DAX in Germany rose 2.5 percent, while the CAC 40 in France gained 1.2 percent. The British FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent.

Markets in Asia were mostly higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.7 percent, while the South Korean Kospi climbed 0.6 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.1 percent, while China’s Shanghai composite index gained 0.7 percent. Stocks in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines were also higher.

1972,"Stocks on Wall Street took their biggest loss in almost a month on Tuesday as investors worried about the health of the United States economy and sold shares in retailers and car companies. Machinery companies also fell, and the price of oil declined again.

Travel companies fell after the cruise line operator Royal Caribbean cut its projections for the year, and automakers and suppliers fell after car companies reported lower American sales for July. Banks finished lower as investors worried about the health of banks in Europe.

While stock indexes set record highs as recently as July 22, shares have traded in a very narrow range for the last few weeks. Because stocks are not making big gains, investors are sensitive to signs of trouble for the economy, including weaker sales of autos or last week’s disappointing report on economic growth.

“The market had just rallied,” said Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, adding that it had now “sort of paused.”

“Any weak reports get magnified,” he said.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 90.74 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,313.77. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 13.81 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,157.03. The Nasdaq composite index slid 46.46 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,137.73. The Dow has fallen seven days in a row.

Auto companies reported lower sales for July in the United States as a heat wave kept buyers at home. General Motors said its sales fell 2 percent and Ford said sales fell 3 percent. After six straight years of growth, auto sales have reached record levels and are starting to plateau. G.M. stock shed $1.37, or 4.4 percent, to $29.93. Ford lost 54 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $11.94. The car retailers CarMax and AutoNation and the supplier BorgWarner all fell.

Royal Caribbean cut its forecasts for the year as the strong dollar continues to hurt its results. That left the cruise line operator’s stock down $4.51, or 6.3 percent, to $67.35. Other consumer companies like the retailers Nordstrom and Kohl’s and the office supply chain Staples stumbled.

Industrial and transport companies struggled. Delta Air Lines said a revenue measurement fell in July and its stock lost $3.09, or 7.8 percent, to $36.39. American Airlines lost $2.09, or 5.9 percent, to $33.51. Emerson Electric, which makes valves and process controls systems, posted disappointing quarterly results. It gave up $2.75, or 4.9 percent, to $53.03.

Oil prices continued to drop, extending a slide that has lasted more than two weeks. Benchmark crude fell 55 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $39.51 in New York — the first time it has closed under $40 a barrel since April 8. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, sank 34 cents, to $41.80 a barrel in London.

The August contract price of gold rose $13, or 1 percent, to $1,364.40 an ounce. Silver jumped 20 cents, or 1 percent, to $20.70 an ounce. Copper added 1 cent, to $2.21 a pound.

The German DAX and French CAC 40 both lost 1.8 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 fell 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index lost 1.5 percent. While the Japanese government approved a stimulus package worth about $274 billion, investors were skeptical it would work. The South Korean Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,019.70. China’s Shanghai composite index edged up 0.6 percent.

Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.55 percent from 1.52 percent. The dollar fell to 100.85 yen from 102.36 yen, and the euro rose to $1.1219 from $1.1165.

US construction spending drops 0.6 percent in June

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. construction spending fell for a third straight month in June with spending on nonresidential construction dropping by the largest amount in six months.

Construction spending fell 0.6 percent in June following declines of 0.1 percent in May and 2.9 percent in April, the Commerce Department reported Monday.

Nonresidential construction declined 1.3 percent, the biggest setback since December, while residential activity was unchanged in June. Spending on government projects fell 0.6 percent, the fourth straight decline, with both federal and state and local construction activity down.

US stocks slip as falling oil prices punish energy companies

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as the price of oil continued to nosedive thanks to the strong dollar. Energy companies took the biggest losses as U.S. crude hovered around $40 a barrel, its lowest price in almost four months, and materials companies also traded lower.

Every oil, gas and pipeline company on the Standard & Poor's 500 finished lower as a slump in the price of oil and other fuels extended into a third week. The losses for energy and mining, chemical and building companies canceled out gains for technology and health care companies.

Gawker founder Nick Denton has filed for personal bankruptcy

NEW YORK (AP) — Gawker founder Nick Denton filed for personal bankruptcy Monday in the aftermath of a Florida jury's awarding $140 million to Hulk Hogan in a privacy case revolving around a sex tape posted on Gawker.com.

As a result of the verdict, which is being appealed, Gawker's parent company has gone into bankruptcy and is up for sale.

Denton's bankruptcy filing Monday says he owes $125 million to Hogan, a former professional wrestler. Filing for bankruptcy protection helps shield him from Hogan after Denton's other legal efforts to block Hogan from collecting failed.

Fleetmatics, based in Dublin, said it has more than 37,000 customers that use its software to track the location of vehicles driven by workers. Verizon, which provides cellphone and internet service, said the deal will boost its workforce management business.

Virgin Galactic gets space tourism rocket operating license

MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) — Virgin Galactic says it has received an operating license for its space tourism rocket from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Virgin Galactic says the operating license will ultimately permit commercial operations. The company said Monday the licensing process involved a review of the system's design, safety analysis and flight trajectory analysis.

Virgin Galatic's first spaceship broke apart in 2014 during its fourth rocket-powered test flight when the co-pilot prematurely unlocked a key system. The second version of the company's SpaceShipTwo was unveiled in February.

Interpol arrests Nigerian accused of $60 million cybercrime

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — A Nigerian accused of scamming $60 million from companies around the world through fraudulent emails has been arrested after months of investigation, Interpol and Nigeria's anti-fraud agency said Monday.

The ringleader of a global scamming network, identified only as 40-year-old Mike, was arrested along with a 38-year-old accomplice in Port Harcourt in June. He is on administrative bail, which implies that officers do not yet have enough evidence to charge him.

The man is accused of leading a network that compromised email accounts of small and medium-sized businesses around the world. The statement didn't name any targets.

1985,"Stocks took another modest step further into record territory Wednesday after several companies reported profits that were stronger than expected. Technology stocks led the way after an encouraging report from Microsoft.

Both the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average set highs, and the Dow marked its ninth consecutive day of gains. It’s the longest winning streak for the measure of blue-chip stocks since 2013, and it has been a decidedly slow and steady one. All but one of those days had a gain of less than 1 percent.

“The problem is, Where do we go from here?” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “I have the tendency to believe the upside is somewhat limited,” in part because stock prices have been rising faster than corporate earnings in recent years.

Companies are in the middle of telling investors how much they earned in the spring, and analysts are forecasting yet another decline from levels at this time last year. The low expectations have made it easier for companies to come in above forecasts.

Microsoft surged to one of the biggest increases in the S.&P. 500 in the first day of trading after it reported quarterly results that easily beat analysts’ expectations. The technology giant’s stock jumped $2.82, or 5.3 percent, to $55.91 after it said momentum in its cloud-computing business helped it to return to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter.

That drove the technology sector up 1.4 percent, much more than the rest of the market.

The best-performing stock in the S.&P. 500 was Cintas, which jumped $9.43, or 9.7 percent, to $106.85. The company, which provides uniforms, restroom supplies and other products for offices, also reported quarterly earnings above analysts’ expectations.

The market’s calm has meant less demand for gold and Treasury bills, traditional go-to investments during periods of fear. The price of gold fell $13 to $1,319.30 per ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent late Tuesday.

The weakest areas of the stock market on Tuesday were sectors that tend to be big dividend payers, such as utilities, which lost 0.5 percent. These types of stocks had led the market for much of 2016 as investors sought alternatives to low-yielding bonds.

Shares of 21st Century Fox fell 75 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $27 as reports swirled that Fox News would soon cut ties with its head, Roger Ailes, after allegations of sexual harassment. Fox News is a key profit-maker for the company.

The price of American crude oil rose 29 cents, to $44.94 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 51 cents, to $47.17 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent, to $1.36 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents, to $1.41 a gallon, and natural gas fell 7 cents, to $2.66 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Silver fell 39 cents, to $19.61 per ounce, and copper fell less than a cent, to $2.25 per pound.

European markets were mostly higher, while Asia’s day was mixed. In Germany, the DAX rose 1.6 percent after Volkswagen reported earnings that were better than analysts were expecting. In France, the CAC 40 climbed 1.1 percent, and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan dipped 0.3 percent.

1987,"A mostly listless day of trading left United States stock indexes little changed on Monday, hovering just below the record highs they set late last week.

Drug company and consumer-focused stocks weighed on the market, while energy companies surged, getting a lift from a pickup in crude oil prices.

The slight pullback came as investors took advantage of the milestones reached on Friday by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and Nasdaq composite to pocket some gains. Strong jobs data left traders feeling more confident about the United States economy heading into this week.

“It’s a little bit of profit-taking,” said Joe Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “We’re coming off a good employment number and we know the consumer’s been strong.”

The stock market hit record highs on Friday after the Labor Department said employers added 255,000 jobs in July — far more than investors expected. The hiring spree, which followed an even bigger surge in June, gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing.

The major stock indexes appeared headed for another day of gains early on, as markets in Asia and Europe shrugged off new data showing China’s exports and imports declined again last month. A report indicating industrial production in Germany grew at a better-than-expected rate in June helped lift markets overseas.

Two drug makers weighed on the market early on.

Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb were hammered after plunging on Friday following news that the company’s cancer treatment Opdivo failed in a study aimed at extending its use for lung cancer patients. The stock lost $2.98, or 4.7 percent, to close at $60.30.

Allergan, the maker of Botox, slid 2.2 percent after second-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts. The stock fell $5.54 to $248.31.

Walmart, the retailing giant, slipped 0.6 percent after the company agreed to buy the fast-growing online retailing newcomer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash and another $300 million in stock. The deal underscores how serious Walmart is about challenging the online leader, Amazon. Shares in Walmart shed 42 cents to close at $73.34.

Earlier, markets in Asia moved mostly higher despite the discouraging economic data out of China. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 1.6 percent, while the Shanghai composite index rose 0.9 percent. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index surged 2.4 percent.

1989,"LONDON — Britons living near ""fracking"" developments will be able to decide how a 1 billion pound shale gas wealth fund should be spent, either by accepting direct personal payments or supporting projects such as railways or flood defences, the government said on Monday.

Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Sunday that some tax proceeds from new shale gas developments could go directly into local residents' pockets, showing her support for the nascent industry that she hopes can ease Britain's growing reliance on imported gas.

In a consultation published on Monday outlining how the shale wealth fund should be run, the government said payments to individual communities, where residents could decide what to do with the money, should not exceed 10 million pounds over the 25-year lifespan of the fund.

Residents would be given the choice of receiving payments directly or picking a project that would help their community.

""Local communities should be the first to benefit from the Shale Wealth Fund, and they should get to decide how a proportion of the funding is used,"" the government said in its consultation document.

Britain is estimated to have plenty of shale gas resources in place, enough to cover the country's annual gas needs for hundreds of years.

But shale gas extraction -- so called fracking -- has been slow because of local residents' and green campaigners' concerns over environmental impact and the fall in energy prices.

In the U.S., where abundant shale gas production has started to turn the country into an exporter, landowners have directly benefited from the shale gas boom because they have rights to mineral resources.

Payouts to communities from the wealth fund will come on top of shale gas operator payments of 100,000 pounds per exploration well and a one percent share of shale gas site revenues.

INEOS, which controls Britain's largest shale gas sites, has pledged to increase the percentage of its revenue it would pay to communities to 6 percent. It said these payments could add up to 2.5 billion pounds.

Shale gas developers welcomed the government's proposal.

""The onshore oil and gas industry in the UK continues to believe that local people should share in the success of our industry and be rewarded for hosting sites on behalf of others in the country,"" said Ken Cronin, chief executive of the UK Onshore Oil and Gas body.

Environmental campaigners said cash sweeteners would not convince Britons about shale gas.

""You can't put a price on the quality of the air you breathe, the water you drink, and the beauty of our countryside,"" said Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist.

Because of an editing error, an article on July 2 about the annulment of Austria’s presidential runoff over procedural irregularities — a decision that gave a far-right, anti-immigrant party a second chance to win — used an erroneous standard of measurement to compare the 90,000 migrants who have applied for asylum in Austria with those who have applied in Germany. The proportion of asylum applicants in each country relative to the population is similar — about 1 percent — but the total numbers are different; Germany, with 10 times the population of Austria, has about a million asylum seekers.

1996,"WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength in early August that could help spur faster economic growth.

Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected rise in import prices in July as a drop in petroleum prices was offset by gains in the cost of other goods. However, renewed dollar strength is expected to curb underlying inflation in the coming months.

""The data remain consistent with a still-strong trend in employment growth, which means the backdrop for consumer spending remains favorable,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 266,000 for the week ended Aug. 6, the Labor Department said. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 75 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1973 when the labor force was smaller.

The four-week average of claims, considered to be a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,000 to 262,750 last week.

With the labor market perceived to be either at or approaching full employment, there is probably little room for further declines in claims. A report on Wednesday showed layoffs fell to a near two-year low in June.

The upbeat claims report and better-than-expected financial results from retailers Kohl and Macy's boosted U.S. stocks. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while the dollar was largely changed against a basket of currencies.

TAME INFLATION

In a separate report, the Labor Department said import prices edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.6 percent in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices falling 0.3 percent in July.

In the 12 months through July, import prices fell 3.7 percent, the smallest decrease since November 2014, after declining 4.7 percent in the 12 months through June. Import prices excluding petroleum increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since April 2011, after dropping 0.3 percent in June.

Last month's increase in import prices came despite a 0.6 percent rise in the dollar against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in July. The dollar lost some steam early in the year. Oil prices, which had started to rise toward $50 per barrel, fell in July and are now below $45 per barrel.

The combination of dollar strength and cheap oil will likely continue to dampen imported inflation pressures and keepoverall inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.

Persistently low inflation suggests the U.S. central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in the near term, even as the labor market approaches full employment.

""Although the pass-through of import prices to consumer price inflation is small, given the large share of spending on services, the weakness in import prices remains an additional hurdle for the Fed in reaching its inflation goal,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The robust labor market is boosting consumer spending and putting a floor under the economy after an inventory correction and lower oil prices restricted GDP growth to an average 1.0 percent annualized rate in the last three quarters.

The economy added a total of 547,000 jobs in June and July. The low number of claims suggests job growth momentum was retained in early August.

2000,"LONDON — Mining and energy group Vedanta Resources expects to complete its merger with Cairn India early next year, a move that would boost the firm's financial strength, Vedanta's CEO said on Friday.

Vedanta is among the resource firms hit by a collapse in commodity prices and it is also facing legal action and activist protests over its operations in Zambia.

In a speech to a London shareholders' meeting, CEO Tom Albanese said the rationale for the merger was compelling, which was why Vedanta announced improved terms in July.

""The merger ... will contribute significantly to our overall financial strength, not least through a potential re-rating, which will lower our overall cost of capital,"" Albanese said, according to a copy of his speech.

""We expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2017.""

The deal, which will give Vedanta access to oil and gas explorer Cairn India's $3.5 billion (£2.6 billion) cash pile, has faced opposition from some big minority shareholders, including British-based Cairn Energy, but Albanese said he did not foresee obstacles.

Vedanta's debt to EBITDA ratio is 5.7 for 2016 compared with the level of around 3 analysts view as comfortable.

Albanese told Reuters after the meeting that Vedanta had repaid close to $1.2 billion of bonds in the first quarter and had no further Vedanta Resources debt maturing until 2018.

""We are committed to deleveraging the balance sheet,"" he said, citing a share price rally - the stock has almost doubled since the end of last year - as proof of market confidence.

Albanese also predicted the commodity price slump has ended.

""My own personal view is that for the first time in more than five years, most commodities will end this calendar year higher than they began the year,"" he said in his speech.

To Reuters, he declined to comment on a case involving Vedanta's copper mining in Zambia because it is being litigated.

Protesters, under the banner of the activist organisation Foil Vedanta, demonstrated at the shareholder meeting, chanting ""shame, shame"" and ""looters, polluters"" as executives walked in.

In May, a high court judge decided that a claim could proceed in the English courts on behalf of 1,826 Zambian villagers seeking compensation following what they say is damage to their health and land caused by Konkola Copper Mines. Vedanta, which has a majority stake in Konkola, has appealed that decision and said Zambia is the appropriate jurisdiction. It expects to know the outcome of the appeal next year.

2003,"Stocks slumped on Tuesday as investors grew fearful over the health of the British financial system.

Investors were jolted after three British financial firms stopped trading in their commercial property funds because large numbers of investors were trying to liquidate their holdings.

Looking for safety, investors flocked to Treasury notes and pushed the yields on long-term government bonds to record lows. Energy companies took the biggest losses as oil prices tumbled.

Stocks mostly fell, although investors bought shares of companies seen as safe plays, like household goods makers and utilities. Bond yields plunged, and the 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields reached record-low levels as demand for Treasuries rose and prices increased.

The yield on the 10-year note dropped to 1.38 percent, a record low according to Tradeweb, down from 1.45 percent late Friday. It went as low as 1.36 percent during the day, according to Tradeweb. The yield on the 30-year note fell to 2.16 percent, also a record. It was 2.24 percent Friday.

It was an abrupt end to a big four-day rally for stocks, and a reminder that the effects of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has left markets deeply unsettled.

“We’ve seen a tremendous rally pretty much every night in longer-term bonds” since the vote, said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings. “There’s just so many unanswered questions both from the legal standpoint, a diplomatic standpoint, an economic standpoint.”

As Cleveland tries to find a path to normalcy after hosting the Republican National Convention, as the city’s urban farmers prepare to benefit from a convention-boosted bonanza of composted coffee grounds* (there’s an up side to everything), it’s worth taking a closer look at a few details in how the party handled global warming in its platform and rhetoric.

Despite a long string of years in which Republican leaders and candidates bashed global warming science, the platform adopted on July 18 has no section characterizing — one way or the other — the party’s view of risks from an unabated buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. I’ll take that sidestep as a promising sign that some high-level Republicans recognize there is no credible way to dispute the basics of the science pointing to a human-heated planet.

The platform does bash the solutions pursued by President Obama, the Environmental Protection Agency and the new international climate agreement produced in Paris in December. And it expresses flat opposition to “any carbon tax.”

But then there’s a weirdly jarring line that seems to clash utterly with any view that warming and the CO2 buildup aren’t worth addressing:

Photo

We urge the private sector to focus its resources on the development of carbon capture and sequestration technology still in its early stages here and overseas.

How can a party platform omit any characterization of global warming and CO2 as a problem while urging businesses to develop a technology with no purpose other than sopping up the main greenhouse gas emission raising the planetary thermostat?

In a free market, wouldn’t that happen on its own accord? What’s the need for urging?

Actually, the only tool that’s seen as making carbon capture economically viable (setting aside huge technical issues) is a rising price on carbon. But the Republicans reject that outright.

Maybe there was confusion because the few elected Republicans who seem to understand global warming skipped Cleveland (as Ben Adler noted on the 18th).

When I posted a note on Twitter about this language, Costa Samaras, a climate-policy analyst at Carnegie Mellon University, agreed: “Firms invest in R. & D. to capture market share of discounted future revenues. No expectation of a greenhouse gas price? No R. & D.”

With this in mind, the only explanation for a line like this is that it was written by some coal or utility or oil executive for whom carbon capture is the only way to stay in business in a world with tightening greenhouse-gas standards. We might have to narrow that down to coal (or a Koch), given that even Exxon Mobil and other oil companies have supported a carbon tax.

How did this section of the platform survive vetting? I’m happy to hear your theories.

In some ways, its prescriptive quality resonates with policies of the new Five Star Movement mayor of Turin, Italy, Chiara Appendino, a vegetarian who just laid out an agenda aimed at sharply cutting consumption of meat and other animal products in that city. Here’s one line from the political game plan, as reported by the Italian website The Local: “The promotion of vegan and vegetarian diets is a fundamental act in safeguarding our environment, the health of our citizens and the welfare of our animals.”

Pledge allegiance and march, left or right….

* Addendum | Here’s a brief addendum on the coffee grounds I mentioned above. The surge of convention attendees in and out of Cleveland’s international airport didn’t do much for the environment, in a sense nicely reflecting the heart of the Republican platform’s section on environmental policy.

But the travel blitz did create a bumper supply of coffee grounds at Starbucks and other food vendors. On Thursday, Gregory Jackson, who founded Groundz, a composting program linked to Rising Harvest Farms, picked up 38 five-gallon buckets of coffee grounds from the airport’s management company.

2010,"NEW YORK — A look at Hostess' ""Deep Fried Twinkies"":

HOW IT'S MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged.

HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes.

THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax.

DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, Aug. 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad.

NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar.

WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist.

LIMITED-TIME TWINKIES: In December, Hostess teamed up with Wal-Mart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake. In June, it worked with the retailer on a tie-in for the new ""Ghostbusters"" movie, creating Key Lime Slime Twinkies for a short-term sale.

2013,"LONDON — Britain's benchmark share index fell to a two-week low on Tuesday as the heavily weighted banking and energy sectors dropped, although motor insurer Direct Line jumped after results.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ended down 0.7 percent at 6,645.4 points, its lowest level since mid-July, as the bank sector extended losses after the results of Europe-wide stress tests. Britain's banking index fell 1.5 percent.

Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which were among the worst-performing banks in the stress test, ended down 3.6 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.

""The recent stress tests have sent bank shares plummeting for a second day,"" CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler said.

Analysts said UK banks were also being affected by drops in Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, which were relegated from the blue chip STOXX Europe 50 index, and by Commerzbank falling after a profit warning.

Shares in oil major Royal Dutch Shell also dropped after HSBC cut its price target on the stock while Liberum analysts downgraded Shell to ""hold"" from ""buy"".

However, Direct Line surged 12.6 percent - its strongest one-day performance on record - after its half-yearly profits beat expectations.

The FTSE 100 is up about 7 percent so far in 2016, although the value of UK shares in U.S. dollar terms has been hit by a slump in sterling following Britain's vote in June to quit the European Union.

2018,"United States markets slipped lower on Monday as the market pulled back after a four-week gain that brought it to record highs. Investors were assessing another batch of corporate earnings and looking ahead to this week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. Yahoo shares fell after Verizon Communications announced that it would buy most of Yahoo’s internet businesses for $4.8 billion.

KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 0.4 percent lower, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite index edged 0.1 percent lower.

YAHOO’S DEMISE Yahoo shares fell 2.7 percent after the company announced that Verizon would buy Yahoo’s advertising, media and email businesses for $4.8 billion, ending a five-month auction. Verizon will add Yahoo to its portfolio of recently purchased media companies, which includes AOL.

After the deal is complete, Yahoo will be a shell of its former self, existing mainly as a holding company for its Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, as well as its patent portfolio.

Verizon shares fell 0.4 percent.

TAKING A BREAK It’s quite common for a market that has run up so far so fast to retreat. With the slow summer trading season and lack of economic news, traders say there are few reasons to be buying the market right now.

“This is a broad, but benign, sell-off,” said Ryan Larson, head of United States equity trading for RBC Global Asset Management.

Larson pointed out the recent price-to-earnings ratio on the S.&P. 500, or the amount money that investors are paying for each dollar of earnings, which was trading at nearly 20. That was far above the typically 14-16 times that investors are usually comfortable with.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Monday. 17,600 17,550 Previous close 18,570.85 17,500 17,450 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

“It’s another reason why the market looks fatigued at the moment,” he said.

ACCELERATING Sprint stock soared 26 percent after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss but added a larger number of subscribers than expected. SoftBank of Japan bought a controlling stake in Sprint nearly three years ago.

ENERGY Oil prices continued their monthlong slide, with the price of United States crude falling $1.12, to $43.07 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, slipped $1.05, to $44.66 a barrel in London.

The 2 percent drop in oil prices dragged down major energy companies. Chevron shares were down 2.4 percent and Exxon Mobil stock gave up 1.9 percent, the two biggest drops in the Dow Jones industrial average. Oil prices are down nearly 12 percent this month.

EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX closed up 0.5 percent and in France, the CAC 40 was up 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 lost 0.3 percent in Britain.

CENTRAL BANKS The Bank of Japan and United States Federal Reserve are both meeting this week. With Japan’s economy barely growing, economists are speculating about whether its central bank may push more stimulus this week. The American economy is in better shape than other advanced economies, and expectations are that the Fed could look to raise interest rates again soon. If the Fed highlights the recent better-than-expected economic reports, economists may move up their predictions for when the next rate increase could happen. The Fed pulled rates off their record low in December but has not moved further.

ANALYST’S VIEW Marc Ostwald, an analyst at ADM Investor Services, said the Fed would probably be in “wait and see” mode as it assessed the economic and market impact of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. He said it would be “particularly interesting to see how they reference the solid run of (economic) data in terms of the policy outlook,” as it could mean they would consider a rate increase as soon as September.

GLOBAL MEETING Over the weekend, envoys of the Group of 20 major economies, meeting in China, promised to protect the world economy from the shock waves of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union and to increase sluggish growth, while rejecting trade protectionism. While the statement was short of concrete promises, the tone seemed to have reassured some investors at a time of heightened uncertainty.

ASIA’S DAY The Nikkei 225 declined 0.04 percent in Japan, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng gained 0.1 percent. The Shanghai composite index added 0.1 percent in China. The Kospi was up 0.1 percent in South Korea. In Australia, the S.&P./ASX 200 gained 0.6 percent.

CURRENCIES AND BONDS The dollar fell to 106.04 yen from 106.17 yen. The euro rose to $1.0978 from $1.0961. Bond prices rose.

Q&A: What record low interest rates mean for savers, economy

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) —Record low interest rates were meant to be a temporary response to the global financial crisis.

But eight years later, rates are still near zero or even below in much of the developed world, and some experts are warning of long-term side effects: a hit to pension savings, pressure on banks, and possible booms and busts in stock markets and real estate.

Some economists argue that people may have to get used to living in a zero-interest world for a lot longer than they expected, or at least one with rates far lower than those in recent decades.

Fund manager Q&A: Dividend stocks look better, if not good

NEW YORK (AP) — Even fans of dividend-paying stocks acknowledge that they're looking riskier, a result of their own success.

Dollars are pouring into stocks of utilities and other companies that make regular payouts to their shareholders, because they're at the center of a few investment trends. Investors are not only hungry for income given the low interest payments bonds are offering; they also want investments that will hold steady when markets are shaky.

The rush has pushed up stock prices for dividend-paying companies faster than their earnings, which has sparked concerns that they're too expensive. Southern Co., the company behind Georgia Power and other utilities, trades at close to 18 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months, for example. That's above its average of 15.4 times over the last decade.

A virtual-reality Olympics? It's OK, but TV is still king

NEW YORK (AP) — If you want to glimpse the future of sports broadcasting, you can check out the Rio Olympics in virtual reality. But if you really want to immerse yourself in the competition, just turn on the TV.

NBC, BBC and other Olympic networks around the world are offering the opening and closing ceremonies and selected events in VR, giving viewers a 360-degree perspective — that is, the ability to look up, down and all around — when they wear special headsets. It's a first in Olympics broadcasting, and NBC itself admits that its more than 100 hours of VR coverage is experimental.

It's good that television networks are getting a head start on figuring out what works with the new technology. Watching the Olympics in VR can occasionally transport you, giving you the sense of actually being there in Rio. But those moments are still too few and far between.

Global oil demand to cool, oversupply is ending, agency says

LONDON (AP) — Global demand for oil will grow less than expected next year due to a weaker world economy, though the oversupply of crude in the market is ending, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.

The Paris-based agency, which consults oil-importing nations, lowered its forecast for demand growth next year to 1.2 million barrels a day from 1.3 million barrels a day previously. That would be a slowdown from this year's growth of 1.4 million barrels a day.

Applications for US unemployment aid slip to a low 266,000

WASHINGTON (AP) — Slightly fewer people sought U.S. unemployment benefits last week, a sign that layoffs are low and employers are probably adding new jobs.

THE NUMBERS: Weekly applications for U.S. unemployment aid barely fell last week, slipping 1,000 to 266,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose 3,000 to 262,750, but remains low. And 2.16 million people are receiving benefits, about 5 percent below last year's level.

1st US offshore wind farm to usher in new era for industry

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The nation's first offshore wind farm is set to open off the coast of Rhode Island this fall, ushering in a new era in the U.S. for the industry.

Developers, federal regulators and industry experts say the opening will move the U.S. industry from a theory to reality, paving the way for the construction of many more wind farms that will eventually provide power for many Americans.

Deepwater Wind is building a five-turbine wind farm off Block Island, Rhode Island to power about 17,000 homes. The project costs about $300 million, according to the company.

Lock picking your way to cybersecurity at Def Con

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Lock picking might seem ridiculously old-fashioned at a cybersecurity gathering — but learning it can actually help people protect machines from digital threats.

As security improves to block remote attacks over the internet, hackers look for ways to deliver malicious software physically instead — for instance, by breaking into a company's data centers. Like cracking a digital system, picking locks involves solving puzzles, along with a certain amount of finesse and skill.

IMF, Egypt agree on $12B loan to fix ailing economy

CAIRO (AP) — The International Monetary Fund said Thursday it will grant Egypt a $12 billion loan over three years to help the Arab world's most populous country mend its ailing economy following years of unrest.

The IMF said the loan, which is subject to approval by its executive board, comes in support of a government reform program that aims to stabilize Egypt's falling currency, reduce the budget deficit and government debt, as well as boost growth and create jobs.

2022,"Video

The Mercedes-AMG GT S is not the car many expect from the tri-star folks. Far from the opulent S-Class and tot-toting GLS S.U.V., the two-passenger GT S clearly says “let’s race.” It’s speaking directly, and confidently, to the Audi R8 and Porsche 911.

“Something wicked this way comes — in yellow,” said an observer, gazing at the Mercedes simmering along the roadside. Indeed, this machine — replacing the longer gullwing SLS — cuts a seductive and menacing figure. The AMG Solarbeam paint on the test model I drove does look suitably wicked. I salute those extroverted souls who choose it over white or silver.

This is not an automobile for the masses, given prices that begin at $132,125. But that’s a bargain of sorts considering it is about 70 grand less than the asking price on the less-sophisticated SLS it replaces. My tester, equipped with fade-free carbon ceramic brakes ($8,950), carbon fiber exterior trim ($5,300) and that Solarbeam paint ($9,900!) has a sticker price of $171,900. I’ll point out that 97-month auto loans are now available.

Aluminum body panels seem to be poured over the aluminum space-frame chassis. Replacing the SLS’s 6.2-liter V8 is a 4-liter V8 with turbochargers nestled between the cylinder banks. (That’s a “hot inside V” setup for jargon lovers).

A plaque on the carbon-fiber engine shroud states that my particular motor was hand-assembled by Martin. He would proudly explain that dry sump lubrication ensures that the cylinders, lined with the proprietary friction-reducing material Nanoslide, always gets proper oil supply, even during extreme cornering forces. The elimination of a traditional oil pan allowed engineers to drop the engine 2 inches for a lower center of gravity.

Yes, there are drive settings to tailor suspension and performance, from “comfort” through a manual mode properly tagged “race”. The optional computer-controlled engine and transaxle reduce vibration. Buy them. They’re only $2,600.

Mercedes claims the turbo V8’s 503 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque launches the 3,627-pound GT S from rest to 60 miles-an-hour in 3.7 seconds (which is conservative, methinks). Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted 7-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission and carbon-fiber drive shaft.

But this car can’t be understood with statistics. The hammer of the throbbing V8 (which never sounds strained) and force of the lateral Gs during cornering simply must be experienced to comprehend.

I did not explore the 193 m.p.h. top speed, nor will I admit that I found cruising at twice the average speed limit to be effortless — officer. Let’s just say the car is crazy capable and should keep fine company with the R8 and 911. Exploring the differences can and should be done only on a track.

A winged higher performance GT R model (yes, higher performance) is expected in 2017.

Gripes? The transmission selector is an awkward reach backward. Personally, I’d pay $1,260 for the panoramic glass roof to brighten things inside. That beautiful cockpit, which looks for all the world to be from Darth Vader’s TIE fighter, is a might snug for a car this size.

And assuming that Lord Vader is a Virgo, he’d spot that the yellow interior stitching is a few Pantone shades off the Solarbeam exterior paint. None of this should shake off perspective buyers, though. Nor should the average E.P.A. fuel economy rating of 18 miles per gallon with premium gasoline.

Compared with the competition, the GT S is fairly practical with its liftgate cargo area, easily hauling two full-size suitcases in back and a third carry-on bag. Not that owners will crave long-distance travel in this coupe. Even in comfort setting, its very firm ride and decibel rating is hardly up to S-Class standards.

But my goodness, what a shape to behold — the love child of a Porsche 911 and Jaguar E-Type. If its silhouette is all you desire, a less expensive GT model (without the S) is due this fall with a $20,000 lower price, and it will hardly be poky.

Considering its looks and performance, the Mercedes-AMG GT S should fast become a classic.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Technology companies made the biggest gains, as they have done over the last few months. Oil prices rose for the second day in a row, something that had not happened for almost three weeks. Bank stocks fell the most, as the interest rate cut suggested that they would not be able to make as much money on lending.

CARRY ON This past weekend’s attempted coup in Turkey, which began after most stock markets closed for trading on Friday, initially jolted the currency markets.

BANKS BETTER THAN EXPECTED Financial stocks rose after Bank of America reported earnings that were better than analysts expected. Banks have struggled with low interest rates, which limit the profits they can make from making loans. Bank of America nevertheless reported a smaller decline in earnings than analysts forecast, in part because of higher trading revenue and cost cuts.

Bank of America jumped 47 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $14.11.

CATCHING UP On Monday there was a flip of the leader board that investors have seen for much of the year. Financial stocks make up the only sector of the S.&P. 500’s 10 that is still down for the year, while technology has made one of the smallest gains.

For much of 2016, the types of stocks seen as the safest and steadiest have led the way. Telecom stocks, for example, are up nearly 22 percent while the S.&P. 500 is up less than 2 percent.

OIL PAIN Energy stocks lagged the market with a loss of 0.2 percent. They fell with the price of crude oil, which declined 77 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.18 a barrel. Brent crude fell 71 cents to $46.90 a barrel in London.

THE SAFETY TRADE The traditional hiding spots that investors flock to when scared were mixed. The price of gold was up 0.1 percent to $1,329 an ounce, but prices for United States government bonds fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 1.58 percent from 1.55 percent late Friday.

EARNINGS RUNWAY A number of companies are scheduled to report quarterly earnings this week, including nearly a fifth of the S.&P. 500. Analysts have dim expectations, and are forecasting a fourth consecutive decline in earnings.

But many investors will pay more attention to what companies have to say about future earnings trends than how they did during the spring. Analysts expect earnings for the S.&P. 500 to return to growth in the current quarter, and investors hope to hear C.E.O.s say at least that conditions are improving, if not good.

GLOBAL MARKETS Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent, France’s CAC 40 was down 0.3 percent and South Korea’s Kospi index rose 0.2 percent. Japan’s stock market was closed for a holiday.

CURRENCIES The dollar rose to 106.15 yen from 105.53 yen late Friday. The euro edged up to $1.1075 from $1.1063.

2043,"But both have learned that adulation on the world stage does not necessarily translate into action at home on a problem as intractable as climate change.

After vowing in Copenhagen to make the United States a leader in the fight on global warming, Mr. Obama saw his climate change bill torpedoed in Congress. Only toward the end of his second term was he able to push through a climate policy that he had always thought of as a Plan B — a suite of regulations on coal-fired power plants — and those too are stalled, this time by a federal lawsuit.

Mr. Obama sees something of a kindred spirit in the prime minister.

“On the world stage, his country is leading on climate change and cares deeply about development, so from my perspective, what’s not to like?” Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trudeau during the prime minister’s state visit in March.

But on the smaller stage here in Canada’s capital, Mr. Trudeau is bumping up against the same opposing forces that stymied Mr. Obama in Washington.

Mr. Trudeau has acknowledged the difficulties. “Climate change will test our intelligence, our compassion and our will,” he told the United Nations in April. “But we are equal to that challenge.”

Canada’s economy relies heavily on oil and gas production, particularly in Alberta, where production of petroleum from the heavily polluting oil sands is a major source of government revenue, and the global collapse of oil prices has left the region suffering. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trudeau is experiencing pushback to efforts to reduce oil demand.

It was Mr. Harper who submitted Canada’s climate change plan to the Paris negotiations, a plan widely criticized as weak. But for all his passionate speeches about climate change, Mr. Trudeau can offer an alternative only after he works out a new pact with Canada’s 10 provincial governments. So far, nothing has emerged.

“We were excited by Trudeau in Paris — he took an opposite stand from the previous government,” said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change envoy. “But it’s not easy to make policies happen.”

Indirectly, just the election of Mr. Trudeau helped Mr. Obama carry out a major environmental decision, the rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have carried nearly a million barrels of oil from Alberta’s oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. While American environmentalists begged him to reject the project, Mr. Obama delayed his decision for years in part to avoid straining relations with Canada.

Mr. Trudeau’s election in October 2015 changed the calculus. Although a Keystone supporter, the prime minister had put the pipeline much lower on his agenda than his climate change commitments. Less than a month after his election, Mr. Obama rejected the pipeline.

The first time Mr. Obama called Mr. Trudeau after a congratulatory election-night call was to give him a heads-up about his Keystone decision. But the call grew into a broader discussion on joint climate change plans. “That call could have gone very differently,” said Mr. Obama’s senior climate change adviser, Brian Deese. “But instead of acrimony, they both resolved that there was a real opportunity for our countries to increase our partnership on climate change.”

The two then met at the Paris climate summit meeting a month later. Then Mr. Trudeau set Canada’s bureaucracy into motion, appointing Catherine McKenna, an international trade lawyer, as his minister of environment and climate change.

“Catherine and her team were warmly welcomed. Her message was essentially, ‘Canada’s back,’” said Todd Stern, the former United States climate envoy.

But Mr. Trudeau’s push for a national plan to tax carbon emissions is still a matter of negotiation. Some provinces, including Alberta, Quebec and British Columbia, have put plans in place to tax or price emissions. Others have refused.

Brad Wall, the premier of oil-producing Saskatchewan, has vowed never to sign any carbon tax agreement.

Meanwhile, in the wake of Keystone XL’s failure, politicians from western Canada are pushing Mr. Trudeau to support new pipelines to the United States.

Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, said she believed Mr. Trudeau was warming to the idea. “He’s become more aware of what it means for our economy, what it means to reposition and get our product to market, and get a better price for our product,” she said.

And climate change remains a sensitive subject on both sides of the border. When the Canadian Green Party leader, Elizabeth May, linked a huge wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alberta, “to the global climate crisis,” she was rebuked by several other politicians, including Mr. Trudeau. Her comments were seen as a distasteful attempt to use the disaster for political purposes, a charge sometimes mirrored in the United States.

Still, support is growing for climate measures in Canada. Ontario, the most populous province, introduced a package of climate change measures earlier this month that included joining Quebec’s cap-and-trade system, which, in turn, is linked to California’s program.

Climate diplomats say that while Mr. Trudeau’s international celebrity will not be enough to push through tough domestic climate policies, it will not hurt.

“If you have Trudeau, who is a much more charismatic figure and gets press attention, then that amplifies what he says and gives a sense of momentum,” Mr. Stern said. “It’s a good thing.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2044,"The markets reached another milestone on Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high.

The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, a widely used benchmark for index funds, added to the record high it set on Monday. Both indexes have eclipsed peaks set in May 2015.

The Dow, which is made up of just 30 stocks, is an older and better-known barometer of the market, but professional investors generally pay closer attention to the S.&P. 500.

The Dow rose 120.74 points, or 0.7 percent, to 18,347.67. That is 35 points higher than its previous record on May 19, 2015.

The S.&P. 500 gained 14.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,152.14. The Nasdaq composite rose 34.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,022.82.

The Dow and S.&P. 500 are each up 5.3 percent for 2016, having roared back after a big drop in January and early February. The S.&P. has soared 17.7 percent since reaching a low of the year of 1,829 on Feb. 11.

The Nasdaq still lags the other two main United States stock market indexes. But the index, which is heavily weighted with technology and biotech stocks, erased its losses for the year on Tuesday.

Investors continued to show an appetite for taking on risk. The biggest gainers included materials companies, banks and energy companies, which have been benefiting from a recovery in the price of oil.

Financial companies, which have lagged the market this year, have been rising in recent days as long-term interest rates move higher in the bond market. Higher rates mean banks can make more money from lending. Citigroup gained $1.15, or 2.7 percent, to $43.44.

Despite recent increases, however, bond yields remain near historical lows, a worrisome sign to many analysts. Just last week, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched a record low.

“I wish we can be celebrating, but it’s a little disconcerting,” said Rob Bartenstein, chief executive of Kestra Private Wealth Services. “You’ve got government bonds at historical lows and equity markets at historical highs. That’s not something you see at the same time.”

He added: “I feel underinvested, but I’m not willing to chase stocks.”

Sectors that investors tend to favor when they’re nervous — including utilities, phone companies and makers of consumer staples — all fell as investors moved money out of lower-risk assets. Bond prices also fell sharply, sending yields higher.

Shares of AMC Entertainment, the owner of the AMC theater chain, were up 7 percent after it said it would buy the European movie theater operator Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group from private equity firm Terra Firma in a deal valued at about 921 million pounds, or $1.22 billion. AMC said the transaction would make it the biggest movie theater operator in the world.

2047,"TOKYO — The Bank of Japan has already prepared a preliminary outline of a ""comprehensive"" review of its policies due next month that will maintain a pledge to hit its 2 percent inflation target as soon as possible, sources familiar with its thinking said.

In the draft, the BOJ identifies sharp falls in oil prices, a prolonged hit to growth from a sales tax hike in 2014 and Japan's inability to shake off its deflationary mindset as hampering achievement of its inflation target, the sources said.

By blaming external factors for keeping inflation subdued, the BOJ could use the review to defend its policy framework from rising criticism that three years of heavy money printing had failed to achieve its price target, they added.

""The outcome will probably show that QQE (quantitative and qualitative easing) and an expansion of it in 2014 have been successful,"" said one of the sources, on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The BOJ's announcement last month of the review triggered the worst sell-off in government bonds in more than three years, as some traders speculated that the central bank feared it was being left with a dwindling policy tool kit and so might begin tapering asset purchases.

Other market players bet the assessment could prompt the BOJ to shift to a more radical policy like ""helicopter money,"" under which it monetises government debt by accepting perpetual bonds.

For such investors, an assessment defending the existing policy could be a disappointment, unless it is accompanied by an expansion of QQE or a deepening of negative interest rates.

The preliminary outline appears to make no direct recommendations on the future direction of monetary policy, though the general tone would suggest that a tapering of the BOJ's massive stimulus programme is unlikely, the sources said.

Several issues have yet to be finalised due to disagreements in the board, such as whether January's decision to adopt negative rates would help boost inflation, they added.

According to the sources, the review would also look at why negative rates have pushed down yields so much for as long as 20- and 30-year bonds, and how damaging the subsequent flattening of the yield curve could be on financial institutions' profits.

NO CONSENSUS ON POLICY

The draft is subject to change depending on debate by the nine-member board. A BOJ spokesman declined to comment.

Officials had been drafting the outline weeks before the July announcement, the sources said, suggesting that the review would be more a defence of the status quo rather than a radical make-over of the existing policy framework.

The BOJ eased policy in July but not as aggressively as financial markets had expected, sending the yen higher and triggering a sell-off in the Tokyo stock market.

At the July meeting, it also said it would conduct a thorough assessment at its next rate review on Sept. 20-21 of the pros and cons of its stimulus programme, which combines negative rates with a huge asset-buying scheme - dubbed QQE - adopted in 2013.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the review would focus on ways to accelerate hitting his price target, suggesting that the outcome would not to lead to an unwinding of stimulus.

""It would be more about refining the strategy for achieving 2 percent inflation,"" a second source said. ""It won't result in ditching negative rates or tapering bond purchases.""

With the September rate review still six weeks ahead, however, there is no consensus on how the assessment could affect the direction of monetary policy, the sources said.

""The assessment will probably be phrased in a way that leaves the BOJ with plenty of flexibility on what to do in terms of monetary policy decisions,"" a third source said.

2048,"Stocks on Wall Street jumped to record highs Friday after a strong jobs report for the month of July gave investors more confidence that the economy was still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared, and investors sold the safe assets they have favored for most of this year.

The Labor Department said United States employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring.

Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy.

“It looks like the economy is improving, it looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing,” said Sam Stovall, United States equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the economy would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending.

2051,"PACARAIMA, Brazil — Government employee Jose Lara this month used some vacation days to take a long scenic bus ride through the verdant plateaus and sweeping savannas of southern Venezuela, but the trip was anything but a holiday.

It was a 36-hour grocery run.

Lara took an overnight bus and then a pick-up truck to get across the border to neighboring Brazil to buy food staples that have gone scarce in Venezuela's crisis-stricken economy.

""Workers can't even enjoy vacation anymore. Look where I am! Buying food for my children,"" said Lara, 40, who was preparing to load 30-kilo (66-pound) packages of rice and flour onto a bus to complete a journey that takes close to 36 hours.

Venezuelans seeking to escape their socialist economy's dysfunction are flooding into the remote Brazilian town of Pacaraima in search of basic goods that are prohibitively expensive or only available after hours in line.

Shoppers have been coming for months, primarily from the industrial city of Puerto Ordaz - already a 12-hour bus ride - but lately they're also arriving from even more far flung regions across the country.

Venezuelans spend hours in supermarket lines. Many increasingly complain that they cannot get enough food to eat three meals per day.

Low oil prices and massive debt-servicing costs have left the country without foreign exchange to import goods, while price and currency controls have crippled domestic companies' capacity to produce locally.

President Nicolas Maduro says the government is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by the United States.

'THE LINE'

Under pressure from local residents after Maduro shut the western border with Colombian border in 2015, Venezuelan authorities allowed several temporary openings for similar shopping excursions in July. Colombia last month halted those trips after more than 100,000 people crossed in a single weekend.

The more remote Brazilian border was never closed.

In the Pacaraima, known to Venezuelans as ""La Linea"" or ""The Line"" because it is immediately across the border, cramped shops are now piled high with sacks of rice, sugar, and flour.

Products piled to waist height stand at the entrance of convenience stores, auto parts shops and even a farm supply store.

""It's good business, but the price of everything is going up in Boa Vista,"" said Mauricio Macedo, 26, who works at a family business that sells artisanal decorations such as clay figurines but for three months has been primarily focused on food items.

Venezuelan regulations require that staple products be sold for a pittance – a kilo of rice is set at the equivalent of $0.12. But obtaining goods at those prices requires waiting in long lines that are increasingly the site of robberies or lootings. That leaves Venezuelans reliant on the black market, where the same bag of rice fetches the equivalent of $2.20.

In Pacaraima, sugar and rice sell for about 40 percent to 45 percent less than what they would cost on Venezuela's black market. The discount is worth it despite the cost of the trip.

They spend the morning and much of the afternoon shopping, then head back across the border to catch another overnight bus.

2053,"NEW YORK — Boeing Co said on Wednesday it will not increase 787 output and could further cut 777 output unless sales of both jets improve, its clearest indication yet that its production of large jetliners may have peaked for now.

""If the market's not going to demand it, we're not going to go,"" Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the sidelines of an investor conference in New York by global investment bank Jefferies, confirming remarks made during the formal program.

""It's not the end of the world"" if Boeing keeps 787 production at 12 a month instead of lifting it to 14 as planned, Smith said during the event. ""We can still be profitable in the program as I see it today at 12.""

Analysts said Smith's statement confirmed that Boeing will not overproduce widebody planes and, most importantly, does not foresee an accounting charge for the 787 if output stays at 12.

Boeing took about $1.7 billion in after-tax charges in its latest result for the 787 and 747 programs to account for excess 787 inventory and slow 747 sales.

Smith said the company would decide in the next two months whether to cut 777 output further. If it fails to sell enough 777s to bridge the gap to new 777X production, ""then we will make an adjustment accordingly,"" he said.

His comments went beyond what he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts after the company released quarterly results last month. Muilenburg said Boeing would ""keep supply and demand in balance"" but did not discuss keeping 787 production at 12 a month or cutting 777 further.

Low oil prices and a series of boom years have slowed orders for new widebody jetliners, raising concerns that Boeing will notch down cash and profit targets.

Smith said on Wednesday that Boeing still has about two years to decide whether to raise 787 output, given lead times for components, and could still generate rising cash flow and profit if production rates ""moderate"" on the 787 and 777.

The list price for the mid-sized 787 is $264.6 million, but airlines typically receive steep discounts.

Boeing has won eight net 777 orders this year and 19 net 787 orders. It already plans to reduce 777 production by 15 percent next year as it switches to the 777X.

Boeing shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $132.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.

2055,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela and Colombia agreed Thursday to the gradual reopening of their border one year after the Venezuelan government closed crossings to crack down on smuggling.

The announcement came after Presidents Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela and Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia met in the Venezuelan city of Puerto Ordaz.

The two agreed to begin the process starting Saturday. Officials will open five border checkpoints for pedestrians from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. each day.

The weekend is sure to see a crush of Venezuelans flooding into Colombia to buy food and medicine.

Venezuelans have been desperate to cross into Colombia to buy basics as shortages worsen in their economically struggling country, an OPEC member that has been hit hard by the fall in oil prices. Some people in the towns on the Venezuelan side of the border have died after being refused permission to cross to better-stocked Colombian hospitals.

Hundreds of Venezuelans stormed a border checkpoint in July and illegally crossed into Colombia for the day to go grocery shopping.

In the weeks following that incident, Venezuela temporarily opened the border for short periods to allow people to buy food and medicine. More than 100,000 Venezuelans crossed into Colombia during a temporary weekend border opening in July. Many had driven in caravans through the night for a chance at snagging precious goods.

Venezuela's government closed all crossings a year ago to try to stem smuggling along the 1,378-mile (2,219- kilometer) border. Officials alleged that speculators were causing shortages in Venezuela by buying up subsidized food and gasoline and taking them to Colombia, where they could be sold for far higher prices.

Before the border was shut, more than 100,000 people crossed the border daily, Venezuela's government said. That number shrank to just 3,000 a day after the closure, nonprofit groups working in the region said. Some people were given special permission to cross, including students attending school in Colombia and some chronically ill patients.

Smuggling of price-controlled gasoline and food into Colombia fell 70 percent after the closure, according to the Venezuelan National Guard.

Santos said Thursday that the reopening would be a slow process.

""It will be a provisional opening as we learn and adjust our decisions every step of the way,"" he said.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2057,"TOKYO — Toyota's much ballyhooed plug-in hybrid Prius Prime is being pushed back by several months, with the new sales date set for late this year or early next year.

Toyota Motor Corp. said Wednesday the launch dates were being delayed for Japan, but not for the U.S. and Europe because they were set to follow Japan from the start. It was unclear what the dates were for any of the regions.

""We decided we want to take our time and more care before starting mass manufacturing,"" said company spokeswoman Kayo Doi. She would not give other details.

Toyota leads the industry in hybrids, which switch between a gas engine and an electric motor.

It has sold 9 million hybrid vehicles since 1997, but only about 75,000 plug-ins, which charge from a regular household plug and switch to operating as hybrids only when batteries run low.

Prius Prime was shown for the first time at the New York International Auto Show in March. Launch delays are not unheard of, but Toyota tends to be conservative about dates and other promises to the public.

Doi denied any parts-supply shortages were behind the delay, and said it was just about taking more time than expected to produce a better product for customers.

The first Toyota plug-in was launched in 2012, after limited leasing from 2009. The company is promising a whopping mileage equivalent to 120 miles per gallon, calculated including how far the vehicle goes as an electric car, without a drop of gas, for Prius Prime called Prius PHV in Japan.

Prius Prime's cruise range as an electric vehicle is 22 miles (35 kilometers), or long enough for about half of American commuters. That rises to about 80 percent for people who can plug in during work, according to Toyota.

Other major automakers offer plug-ins, including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Volvo, as well as electric cars from Tesla and Nissan Motor Co.

A price for Prius Prime has not yet been announced. The plug-in battery is an expensive component and falling oil prices have been eroding the appeal of hybrids and plug-ins.

2059,"WASHINGTON — U.S. manufacturing activity eased in July amid shrinking order backlogs and declining employment, while an unexpected drop in construction spending in June suggested second-quarter economic was probably even weaker than reported last week.

The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) report on Monday also showed manufacturers ramping up production to an 18-month high even as factories continued to draw down inventories, which some economists said pointed to moderate growth in the sector.

Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina, said it was counterintuitive for manufacturers to step up production while cutting payrolls and running down inventories, given that production is a coincident indicator for the economy.

""Perhaps the inventory drawdown has left stockrooms too spare, resulting in production increases as orders pick up,"" Quinlan said. ""These crosscurrents are explained somewhat by the fact that we are late in the economic cycle and businesses are understandably cautious with all the various risk factors.""

ISM said its index of national factory activity slipped 0.6 percentage point to a reading of 52.6 last month. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The index has now increased for five straight months.

Manufacturers reported a moderate slowdown in new orders as well as export order growth. Order backlogs contracted as did factory employment and inventories, though the pace of destocking slowed. Manufacturers also reported that their customers continued to view inventories as too high.

An outright drop in business inventories weighed on economic growth in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising at a tepid 1.2 percent annualised rate after increasing at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter.

Manufacturing remains constrained by the lagging effects of the dollar's rally and an oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015, which have hurt exports and undercut business spending. With the dollar rising in recent months and oil prices slumping again, economists see little upside for manufacturing.

'HAND-TO-MOUTH' GROWTH

""Any growth in manufacturing is of the hand-to-mouth variety rather than a vibrant expansion,"" said Michael Montgomery, U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.

""With the recent strength in the dollar still not fully reflected in imports and exports yet, we will need the data to be more convincing to call this anything more than almost stalled.""

U.S. financial markets largely ignored the data. The S&P 500 index hit an intraday record high before falling into negative territory. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending declined 0.6 percent to its lowest level since June 2015 after dipping 0.1 percent May. June marked the third straight month of declines in outlays. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.5 percent in June after a previously reported0.8 percent drop in May. Their June estimates were largely based on the government's assumptions for private residential and nonresidential construction spending in the advance GDP report.

""The assumptions for June construction spending plugged into the advance GDP estimate were optimistic,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

""The government hasn't released all of their assumptions yet, but these figures look consistent with second-quarter GDP growth being revised down to 1.1 percent or 1.0 percent.""

Weak spending on home building and nonresidential structures, including gas and oil well drilling, contributed to anaemic growth in the last quarter.

In June, construction spending was held down by a 0.6percent drop in private construction. Outlays on private residential construction were unchanged as spending on both single-family and multi-family projects fell. Private residential construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in May.

Spending on private nonresidential structures fell 1.3 percent in June, the biggest decline since December 2015, after rising 0.4 percent in May. Public construction spending slipped 0.6 percent in June, dropping for a fourth straight month.

Outlays on state and local government construction projects, the largest portion of the public sector segment, fell 0.5 percent, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Federal government construction spending dropped 2.3 percent in June.

2061,"WASHINGTON — U.S. retail sales were unexpectedly flat in July as Americans cut back on discretionary spending, pointing to a moderation in consumption that could temper expectations of a sharp pickup in economic growth in the third quarter.

Other data on Friday showed that producer prices recorded their biggest drop in nearly a year in July amid declining costs for services and energy goods. Cooling consumer spending and tame inflation suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates anytime soon despite a robust labor market.

""Fed members are afraid to come out from under their rocks until growth is sustainably solid and inflation in, near or at their target, and today's reports don't provide them with any comfort that will happen soon,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

July's unchanged retail sales reading followed an upwardly revised 0.8 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department said. Retail sales in June were previously reported to have increased 0.6 percent. Sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago.

Motor vehicle sales increased 1.1 percent last month. Rising demand for autos is pulling spending away from discretionary items, including sporting goods, whose sales in July suffered their biggest drop since January 2015.

Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were also unchanged last month after rising 0.5 percent in June. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

Economists had forecast overall retail sales rising 0.4 percent and core sales climbing 0.3 percent last month. Some cautioned against reading too much into the July data, citing a labor market that is at or near full employment, and said they expected sales to bounce back in August.

""You have had two months of very strong job growth. It just seems very odd that spending would be weak. I will wait for the revisions before declaring July retail spending means anything more than random volatility,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York.

U.S. Treasuries were trading higher on the data, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were little changed as the impact of rising oil prices offset the weak data.

There was another jump in online sales last month as they continued to grab market share from traditional retailers.

Macy's said on Thursday it would close an additional 100 stores as it tries to turn around its business after six quarters of falling sales. Like other department stores, Macy's has been squeezed by stiff competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com.

""The growth of on-line retailing is having impacts on the broader economy. For one, construction of shopping centers and other commercial structures obviously has suffered,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

""Thankfully, commercial building has never been a huge share of business construction spending and so the impact on GDP is rather limited.""

PRICE PRESSURES MUTED

Separately, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand dropped 0.4 percent last month, the first decline since March and the largest since September 2015. It increased 0.5 percent in June.

In the 12 months through July, the PPI slipped 0.2 percent. That was the biggest drop since December 2015 and followed a 0.3 percent increase in the 12 months through June.

A strong dollar and cheaper oil continue to keep price pressures muted, leaving inflation running persistently below the Fed's 2 percent target. Fed officials have repeatedly expressed concern about low inflation.

The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. Although a Reuters poll on Thursday found that most economists expect another rate increase in December, financial markets currently anticipate such a move only next year.

Interest rate futures after Friday's data placed only a 43 percent probability of a December rate hike, compared to 47 percent before the data.

Robust consumer spending has helped to cushion the blow on the economy from an inventory correction and the prolonged drag from lower oil prices that have restricted GDP growth to an average 1.0 percent annualized rate in the last three quarters.

While Friday's data suggested consumer spending was cooling after the second quarter's brisk 4.2 percent rate of increase, economists still expected growth in consumption to top a 2.5 percent pace in the current quarter.

Strong labor market gains as well as rising home and stock market prices should underpin spending. The economy created a total of 547,000 jobs in June and July.

A third report showed consumer sentiment was stable in early August, though households' views on income softened a bit. Most of the weakness was among younger households who cited higher expenses than anticipated, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment survey.

Americans are facing rising rents and healthcare costs.

Following the retail sales report, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.5 percent rate.

Growth is expected to be driven by a rebound in inventory investment, as well as consumer spending.

A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed businesses made significant progress in June in their efforts to reduce an inventory overhang that has weighed on economic growth since the second quarter of 2015. The inventory-to-sales ratio fell to a seven-month low of 1.39 months in June.

LONDON — “Be brave,” Jussi Pylkkanen, Christie’s global president, urged the crowd at Wednesday evening’s postwar and contemporary art sale as he began taking bids for one of two works by Jean-Michel Basquiat.

At least one seller clearly wasn’t feeling intrepid, withdrawing the sale’s top lot, Gerhard Richter’s “Abstraktes Bild (811-2),” a 1994 painting estimated at about $19 million, just before the auction. Or perhaps Christie’s was unable to generate enough interest in that piece, which did not have a guarantee.

Still, the cautious sense of Brexit-proof resilience in the art market that surfaced at Sotheby’s auction on Tuesday and at Phillips’s sale on Monday was also clear at Christie’s 39-lot auction. The sale brought a total of 39.6 million pounds, or $52.8 million, compared with a presale estimate of $35.1 million to $50 million.

Wednesday night’s mood was particularly buoyed by the flurry of bidding for the Basquiats.

Eight works by the urban artist, who died in 1988, had been consigned to Christie’s by the actor Johnny Depp (six will be auctioned at Christie’s day sale on Thursday). The first of the group, a 1981 self-portrait made of paint and paper on three hinged wooden panels, sold Wednesday after heated bidding for 3.5 million pounds, or $4.7 million, to Acquavella Galleries, well exceeding its high estimate of $1.9 million.

And the artist’s “Pork” from the same year, painted on a door, sold for £5.1 million, or $6.8 million, to a telephone bidder competing with an unidentified woman at the back of the room. This price, the highest of the evening, surpassed the high estimate of $4.4 million.

William Acquavella, who said he purchased the Basquiat self-portrait to sell at his gallery, added that caution persists in the market. “There just isn’t that much quality — pickings are slim — but it’s been like this for a while,” he said. “The auction houses aren’t offering as many guarantees and dealers are doing more privately. Sellers don’t want to take the risk. It’s a volatile time, and people need the assurance of getting the price they want.”

The auction started out strong with Adrian Ghenie’s “Dr. Mengele” a 2011 oil on canvas that is part of a series by the painter depicting the notorious Nazi doctor at Auschwitz. It sold for £398,500, or about $530,300.

(Final prices include the buyer’s premium: 25 percent of the first £100,000; 20 percent of the next £100,000 to £2 million; and 12 percent of the rest. The presale estimates do not reflect commissions.)

Other high points included Sean Scully’s “Eve,” an oil on three attached canvases that sold for £902,500, or $1.2 million.

Christie’s said at a postsale news conference that the auction drew bidders from 39 countries across four continents, including many participants from Asia. Ten of the lots sold to buyers in Britain, which has been buffeted by last week’s referendum result calling for the nation to exit from the European Union. “The response was very global,” said Brett Gorvy, Christie’s worldwide chairman for postwar and contemporary art.

“Asian bidding was across the scale on artists like Basquiat, Ghenie and Scully,” he said. “We haven’t seen that up to now.”

There were surprises. Francis Outred, Christie’s European head of postwar and contemporary art, said he had anticipated that Andy Warhol’s “Two Dollar Bills” would sell to an American “because of the cheap dollar.” Instead, it went to a British-based buyer for $5.9 million.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Time Warner invests in Hulu in win for cable cord-cutters

NEW YORK (AP) — Time Warner has become the latest media company to invest in streaming service Hulu.

The move could boost the viability of an online TV service that Hulu is expected to launch next year as an alternative to cable TV. Sony and Dish already operate online TV services, while Apple has expressed interest in one, according to published reports. None of those companies, however, have the networks themselves as full partners or owners, the way Hulu does.

US stocks tick higher as energy prices jump

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks edged higher Wednesday as energy companies climbed with the price of oil. Banks also rose, and investors sold traditionally safe stocks.

Stocks opened lower but gradually recovered to finish at their highest levels of the day. The price of oil jumped after the U.S. government said gasoline stockpiles shrank last week. A survey showed private U.S. business payrolls grew by 179,000 in July. That suggests hiring is still healthy, but that wasn't enough to excite investors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. companies added 179,000 jobs in July, according to a private survey, a steady gain suggesting that hiring remains healthy after a sharp fall-off in the spring.

Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that last month's job growth was driven by services companies — ranging from retailers to shipping firms — which added 185,000 positions. Construction companies, by contrast, cut jobs. And manufacturers added a meager 4,000 positions.

The report showed that many businesses are still hiring even as economic growth has remained sluggish.

UK desperately short of trade experts to lead Brexit talks

LONDON (AP) — Britain is woefully short of one thing it desperately needs in its high-stakes divorce from the European Union: experienced trade negotiators.

Ever since Britain joined the bloc in 1973, the EU has handled its trade talks, so expertise in this area has migrated to Brussels. That means the government has only a few dozen skilled negotiators — against the 1,200 it will need, by one estimate — as it embarks on the complex talks that will determine the U.K.'s relationship with its most important trading partners.

Consumer staples companies posted the biggest gains. Utilities stocks, a traditional safe haven for investors seeking less risk, were a close second. Oil prices fell.

“The equity market has realized that the ‘Brexit’ in a vacuum by itself is not a reason to wholesale abandon equities,” said David Schiegoleit, managing director of investments for the private client reserve at U.S. Bank. “But there is still the fear that it becomes contagious with other economies in Europe.”

2070,"United States stocks rose sharply on Monday as investors grew hopeful that Britain would remain in the European Union.

Asian stocks traded higher and indexes in Europe soared as the latest opinion polls and betting markets suggested it was more likely that Britain would stay in the E.U. Britons vote in a referendum on the matter on Thursday.

The British pound rose sharply, and investors dumped ultrasafe assets like American government bonds, gold and utility stocks, sending those prices lower. Machinery and consumer companies jumped, and energy companies rose with the price of oil.

Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust, said Britain’s status in the E.U. would not affect American businesses much, though it could hurt European banks. Investors, he said, were worried about what would happen to the union if Britain did leave. “It’s not the direct effects that people are worried about, it’s the indirect ones,” he said.

Bond prices dropped as investors moved money out of ultrasafe assets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.68 percent from 1.61 percent late Friday. That’s an encouraging sign for banks since bond yields are used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans — including mortgages — and banks will be able to make more money from lending as rates increase.

Bank of America rose 14 cents, or 1 percent, to $13.54 and Wells Fargo, the nation’s biggest mortgage lender, rose 33 cents to $46.93.

2076,"Stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as investors let up on the accelerator after a three-week rally sent indexes to new highs.

The Dow Jones industrial average inched 25.96 points higher, or 0.1 percent, for its eighth consecutive gain, setting another record at 18,559.01. But the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which more mutual funds use as a benchmark, pulled back from its record high. It fell 3.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,163.78. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 19.41, or 0.4 percent, to 5,036.37.

A mixed set of corporate earnings reports helped keep the market in a tight range throughout the day. The S.&P. 500 was down for the entire day, but never by more than 0.4 percent. For every seven stocks that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, about 10 fell.

Netflix was one of the decliners that pulled down the S.&P. 500. It fell $12.97, or 13.1 percent, to $85.84 after its video streaming service reported adding fewer subscribers last quarter than it had expected. The tumble continued a sharp turnaround for Netflix, whose stock has struggled in recent months after more than doubling in 2015.

Philip Morris International lost $3.11, or 3 percent, to close at $99.89 after reporting weaker quarterly results than analysts had expected. Smokers in North Africa, Japan, Argentina and elsewhere bought fewer cigarettes, leading to a 5 percent drop in shipments from a year earlier.

Better-than-expected earnings from Johnson & Johnson helped prop up the Dow Jones industrial average, which has just 30 stocks. The company’s shares rose $2.11, or 1.7 percent, to $125.25 after it raised its forecast for profits this year.

“For investors, the most important questions are: When is the recession coming, and am I paying too much for stocks?” said Linda Duessel, senior equity strategist at Federated Investors. “Everything else is noise, and there’s so much noise.”

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Tuesday. 18,560 18,540 18,520 Previous close 18,533.05 18,500 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

Ms. Duessel said that she did not see a recession on the horizon and that stock prices could remain high because government bonds and other alternatives looked even less attractive.

A report on the housing industry was the latest to show unexpectedly positive data for the United States economy, joining updates this month on retail sales and job growth. Home construction strengthened more in June than economists had expected. The June reading on housing starts from the Commerce Department was the highest since February, though it was down from a year earlier.

The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that indicators pointed to a pickup in the United States economy after a weaker-than-expected first quarter. But it also lowered its forecast for global growth this year, to 3.1 percent from 3.2 percent, because of Britain’s vote last month to leave the European Union.

Overseas, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.4 percent on a weaker yen and a Pokémon Go-powered rally in Nintendo shares. The French CAC 40 was down 0.6 percent, and in Germany, the DAX shed 0.8 percent.

In the bond markets, the yield on the 10-year United States Treasury fell to 1.56 percent from 1.58 percent late Monday. The price rose 7⁄ 32 , to 10020⁄ 32 .

Precious and industrial metals prices ended the day mixed. Gold rose $3.10, to $1,331.50 an ounce. Silver fell 7 cents, to $20.01 an ounce, and copper rose nearly 3 cents, to $2.26 a pound.

The price of crude oil fell 21 cents to $45.45 a barrel. Brent crude lost 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $44.66 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent, to $1.38 a gallon. Heating oil edged up less than 1 cent, to $1.38 a gallon, and natural gas rose less than 1 cent, to $2.73 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights from The New York Times. Below are highlights from radio and television interviews featuring Times reporters and editors.

Nicholas Casey, The Times’s Andes bureau chief, joined KPCC Radio’s “Take Two” to discuss the effects of Venezuela’s drought and economic meltdown:

“The crisis in the long term has to do with the price of oil. Oil basically funds everything that happens in Venezuela. The short-term crisis, though, what you’re seeing on the streets, is the fact that there isn’t enough food and [the country] can’t import the food, because it doesn’t have the money it needs to do that. So if you go outside, there will be lines of maybe 50, maybe 500 people that are waiting to get food, and what’s happening is when people in these lines are finding that there’s nothing at the end of them, sometimes they are turning into mobs.”

Mark Leibovich, chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine, joined MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to discuss his latest cover story for the magazine on the Republican Party’s self-immolation in the midst of Donald J. Trump’s campaign:

“There’s a danger that someone is swallowing the entire Republican Party whole and taking over the entire campaign and making it difficult — if not impossible — to talk about anything else. And Reince Priebus is in charge of the whole Republican Party and he’s facing down the barrel of a really, really scary situation in November.”

Carl Hulse, chief Washington correspondent for The Times, joined PBS’s Charlie Rose for a conversation about the Senate’s vote on gun safety measures:



“It was fairly predictable, even though everyone in the Senate and probably most Americans would agree that people on terror watch lists shouldn’t buy guns. … Nothing is easy in Washington, and there’s a lot of politics at play here, so Democrats voted for their proposals, Republicans voted for theirs, and it didn’t go anywhere. It was sort of an embarrassing defeat.”

John Schwartz, a science reporter at The Times, joined WAMU Radio’s “The Diane Rehm Show” for an in-depth conversation about climate change:","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2082,"United States stocks made their biggest gain in a month on Thursday as investors grew more optimistic that Britons would vote to stay in the European Union.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds, sending bond yields and bank stocks higher.

On the day of the British referendum, bank stocks did the best, while materials companies also rose. The price of oil topped $50 a barrel. Utility companies, which are generally seen as a safe investment, lagged the market as investors took more risks.

Throughout the year, the market has bobbed up and down as investors traded on political and central bank news, like the British referendum and comments from the Federal Reserve.

J. J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, said that was because the global economy was sluggish. Corporate profits and revenue have also been uninspiring.

“What it really shows is just a lack of growth,” he said. “That makes it very difficult to commit capital and I think that’s a pattern you’re going to continue to see.”

United States stocks have advanced about 2 percent this week. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 27.87 points, about 1.3 percent, to 2,113.32. The Nasdaq composite climbed 76.72 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,910.04.

European stock indexes also advanced. The CAC 40 in France rose 2 percent and the German DAX gained 1.8 percent. The British FTSE 100 rose 1.2 percent.

Bond prices declined, sending the yield of the 10-year Treasury note to 1.74 percent from 1.69 percent a day earlier.

Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make money on lending. Citigroup rose $1.78, or 4.2 percent, to $44.46; Bank of America gained 43 cents, or 3.2 percent, closing at $14.04.

2084,"HSBC was hired to convert dollars into British pounds for a company as it was preparing to complete the sale of a subsidiary. The complaint does not identify the client, but it was Cairn Energy, according to a person with direct knowledge of the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Cairn, a midsize oil and gas company based in Edinburgh, was selling its Indian subsidiary to Vedanta Resources, an Indian conglomerate owned by the mining magnate Anil Agarwal.

The two HSBC executives are accused of using their knowledge of the deal to trade ahead of the $3.5 billion currency transaction, “ramping” up the price of one currency to benefit the bank at the expense of its client.

The criminal complaint unsealed on Wednesday detailed conversations between Mr. Scott and Mr. Johnson discussing how high they could “ramp” up the price of the currency before the company would “squeal.”

In the Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson, 50, was released on a $1 million bond secured by $300,000 cash and his house in Britain. A lawyer for Mr. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

It is unclear where Mr. Scott, who is 43 and also a British citizen, is currently located.

The case is being led by federal prosecutors in the office of Robert L. Capers, the United State attorney in Brooklyn.

The criminal charges against the individuals follows a broader investigation of banks into alleged manipulation of foreign currency trading that federal prosecutors began about three years ago.

HSBC was one of five banks to reach a combined $4.25 billion settlement in 2014 with United States, British and Swiss regulators over accusations that the banks had conspired to manipulate currency rates.

But HSBC was not among five banks that agreed last year to plead guilty to felony charges in connection with manipulating the price of dollars and euros. Those banks agreed to pay criminal fines totaling more than $2.5 billion.

HSBC has previously said the Justice Department is continuing to investigate the bank. It has set aside an additional $1.3 billion for further potential settlements, according to a filing last summer.

Robert Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, which is based in London, said on Wednesday that the bank had been and would continue to cooperate with the Justice Department’s foreign exchange investigation.

While HSBC was not implicated in Wednesday’s criminal complaint, the case is another black eye for the London-based bank that has substantial operations in the United States.

In 2012, it paid $1.9 billion in fines to United States authorities to settle allegations of being a conduit for illegal money. The deal included a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the Justice Department.

The Justice Department’s decision not to criminally charge HSBC in that case received renewed scrutiny last week, when a report prepared by Republican staff of the House Financial Services Committee showed that prosecutors at the Justice Department wanted to criminally charge the bank, but were overruled by top officials in the department, including the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr.

And HSBC paid $550 million in 2014 to settle allegations that it made billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities appear to be compliant with regulations.

The latest case stems from 2011, when HSBC was one of 10 banks that were invited to bid for the right to execute the currency transaction on behalf of Cairn Energy. Each competing bank was required to sign a confidentiality agreement.

In its bid submission, HSBC pledged it could “provide one quote for the full amount or even drip feed the market in the utmost confidential nature so as to ensure there are no sudden FX moves against the company,” according to the complaint.

But when HSBC won the bid in October of 2011, it did the exact opposite, the complaint says. After securing the lucrative job, a supervisor at HSBC told Mr. Scott on a call that the bank did not want to “push the market too much” higher “and at the same time we want to make money on this,” according to the complaint.

Mr. Johnson and Mr. Scott began to buy British pounds in exchange for other currencies, which they later sold for a profit to HSBC on the day of Cairn’s currency deal on Dec. 7, the government said.

In a call to discuss the details of Cairn’s transaction with HSBC, Mr. Scott “falsely and fraudulently” advised representatives at Cairn on the best time of the day to execute the trade, according to the complaint.

When an adviser working on behalf of the company questioned Mr. Scott’s logic, he added that if traders in the market were aware of the transaction, “they will try to jump in front and start to muck around in the markets,” according to the complaint. Mr. Johnson also gave his own personal recommendation along the same lines.

Minutes after the call ended, Mr. Scott and Mr. Johnson began aggressively buying up pounds.

When Cairn representatives did notice the sudden spike in the price of the British pound and asked HSBC, the person was told the spike in trading was the result of a Russian bank buying pounds at the same time as Cairn.

Mr. Johnson, according to the complaint, was surprised to learn that Cairn Energy decided to go ahead with the multibillion-dollar currency transaction, even as his trading in the markets had caused the price of the currency to soar to its highest point of the day.

Responding to the news, Mr. Johnson replied, “Ohhhh, Christmas,” using an expletive as an adjective.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2091,"United States markets rose on Monday, as shares of energy companies rose along with the price of oil. Fertilizer companies also gained ground, but shares of retailers slumped. Stocks wobbled but remained higher after the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, gave a mixed view of the economy.

KEEPING SCORE At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.64 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up nearly 0.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.53 percent.

YELLEN SPEECH Ms. Yellen spoke to the World Affairs Council in Philadelphia on Monday afternoon. She said the economy was improving, but was marked by so many uncertainties that it was not clear when the Fed should resume raising interest rates.

Until Friday most investors had expected the Fed to raise interest rates this summer, but after a surprisingly weak May jobs report, they are unsure of the Fed’s intentions. Ms. Yellen, who called that report “disappointing,” had said recently that the Fed would probably raise interest rates in the next few months if the economy kept getting stronger. The Fed’s policy makers will meet next week.

THE QUOTE The investment manager Luke Bartholomew of Aberdeen Asset Management said Ms. Yellen was noncommittal and investors may have been hoping for more details.

“I don’t think there was enough to sort of swing the market either way,” he said. Stocks weakened during Ms. Yellen’s remarks but returned to their prior levels within an hour.

ENERGY Benchmark United States crude oil pared earlier gains and was up $1.07, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $49.69 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained 91 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $50.55 a barrel. Natural gas prices also rose.

Shares of Chesapeake Energy climbed 11.7 percent and Southwestern Energy stock rose nearly 5 percent. Shares of Exxon Mobil added 1.1 percent.

OIL TURMOIL The price of oil has rebounded over the last few months, but remains far lower than it was two years ago, causing a lot of pain for energy companies.

The oil and gas exploration company Devon Energy said Monday it would sell almost $1 billion in assets later this year, sending its stock up 4.6 percent. The oil field services company Hercules Offshore filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than a year. Hercules plans to sell all of its assets to pay off investors, including international divisions.

Halliburton shares gained 4.8 percent and shares of Baker Hughes rose about 7 percent.

FERTILIZER Shares of CF Industries climbed 8.9 percent, and Mosaic stock rose 6.2 percent. That helped pull materials and chemicals companies higher.

BANKS Bank shares traded higher as bond yields made a modest recovery after a big drop on Friday. As bond prices fell, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.72 percent from 1.70 percent. Higher bond yields drive interest rates higher on long-term loans such as mortgages, which helps banks make more money from lending.

ABBVIE STUDY Shares of the drugmaker AbbVie slid after investors were disappointed with results from a study of a lung cancer drug that AbbVie is acquiring. In April, AbbVie agreed to buy Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion, gaining the company’s stem cell treatment ova-T in the process. But after the results were announced, AbbVie stock declined 3.4 percent.

2092,"Stocks gave up some early gains to finish lower on Wednesday as energy companies sank with the price of oil and weak quarterly reports weighed down technology companies.

After two days of closing higher, shares rose in the morning but couldn’t hang on to the gains. Energy companies fell after energy stockpiles shrank by a smaller amount than analysts expected, and announcements from Adobe Systems and HP hurt tech stocks. Drug companies traded higher.

Trading was light as investors watched Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, testify before Congress and waited for Thursday’s referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union.

Benchmark American crude fell 72 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $49.13 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, lost 74 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $49.88 a barrel in London.

Health care shares climbed after Medicare spending did not exceed levels that would have required action by a cost-cutting board. The review board doesn’t have any members yet, but investors have worried for months that the government will pressure drug companies to cut their prices.

Tim Anderson, an analyst for Alliance Bernstein, said the development was good for health care investors, but said spending might hit the target next year, giving the next president more leverage in trying to lower drug prices. Bristol-Myers Squibb rose $1.06, or 1.5 percent, to $72.31. Celgene, the cancer drug maker, jumped $2.37, or 2.4 percent, to $99.23.

Tesla shareholders reacted harshly after the electric carmaker offered to buy the solar panel maker SolarCity for up to $2.8 billion to try to create a one-stop shop for clean energy.

2093,"In that way, Mrs. Clinton could walk a difficult line. Her ambitious climate change goals should appeal to young and progressive voters, particularly supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called for a carbon tax. But by avoiding mention of such a tax, she hopes to avoid Republican attacks on a proposal that would raise gasoline and electricity bills.

“In an ideal world, the negative externalities would have a price on them,” said Scott Hennessey, the vice president of policy at the solar power company SolarCity, using an economics term for pollution. “But we know it’s not politically realistic. And we need to be realistic about what we can get.”

Economists have noted that by driving up the cost of fossil fuels, a carbon price is intended to push the market toward cleaner sources of energy, such as wind and solar. In the long run, that could make those energy sources cheap and widespread. But in the short run, it could drive up the cost of filling tanks with gasoline and electricity generated by coal and gas — a nonstarter for many voters.



Veterans of the Obama administration are still smarting from the president’s failed first-term effort to cap carbon emissions and to force carbon-emitting companies to purchase or trade for permits for every ton of carbon dioxide released. That “cap-and-trade” plan died in Congress in 2010, and contributed to Democrats’ loss of the House majority that year.

“A lot of the people who cast those votes in the House ended up paying a big price in the 2010 election,” said David Axelrod, the former senior political adviser on Mr. Obama’s campaigns and in the White House. “If I’m in her campaign, I don’t want to hand a cudgel to the other side.”

Conservative campaign operatives agree that they would immediately pounce on any mention by Mrs. Clinton of a carbon price.

“Hillary Clinton surely knows the political peril of directly telling American families that she wants to tax their gasoline,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch.

Since the political fallout from 2010, Mr. Obama has sought to circumvent Congress on climate change. He used his executive authority to release Clean Air Act regulations on vehicles and power plants, the nation’s two largest sources of carbon pollution.

Under the Paris Agreement, an accord committing nearly 200 countries to lowering carbon emissions, Mr. Obama pledged to reduce the United States’ emissions 25 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050.

Photo

Experts say that under a combination of Mr. Obama’s policies and a handful of new policies that would not require Congressional action, it would be possible to reach the 2025 Paris target, but not the 2050 target. Mrs. Clinton has pledged that her policies would put the nation on a path to meeting that 2050 target.

“The overwhelming view of the people who have looked at this is that there’s no way to get to the 2050 goal, and probably the near-term goal, without a carbon price,” said Jessica Tuchman Mathews, a former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “At the very least, it would be like attempting to climb a very steep mountain with one leg tied behind your back.”

Absent a carbon price, Mrs. Clinton plans to use a mix of new regulations, grant programs and spending on new infrastructure to achieve her targets. She would also spend $30 billion on a plan to help redevelop coal mining communities that are suffering economically in the wake of climate change policies.

But experts say that such a piecemeal approach, while it would feasibly reduce emissions, would probably be less efficient and more expensive than the imposition of a single carbon price. It would also probably reach a point of diminishing returns because the Obama regulations have already affected the two most polluting industries.

“She can continue to put out more rules,” Mr. Victor said. “But the Obama administration showed us the high-water mark for what is possible on climate change with executive authority.”

And Mrs. Clinton would need at least some action by Congress to meet her goals — legislators would need to appropriate the $60 billion she intends to spend on clean infrastructure grants to states, and the $30 billion to help coal communities.

Mrs. Clinton’s advisers say she is confident that Congress would appropriate the money because it would be funneled directly to states. Experts are skeptical.

“It’s hard to see how she gets this kind of money from a public budget,” Mr. Victor said.

Among environmental groups and the renewable energy industry, however, there is support for Mrs. Clinton’s proposals, however difficult they might be, compared with those of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, who denies the established science of human-caused climate change.

Even economists are sounding like realists.

“The clearest and most obvious way to reach the climate targets is with a nationwide carbon pricing method, whether a carbon tax or a cap and trade,” said Robert Stavins, the head of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. “But it’s not surprising, given the politics, that Secretary Clinton would not want to explicitly talk about carbon pricing.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

As growing lawlessness, looting and hunger threaten to plunge Venezuela into a state of anarchy, its neighbors remain strikingly reluctant to confront President Nicolás Maduro.

There have been unabashed enablers, a shrinking but resolute camp of left-wing governments that have served as apologists for the despotic president. There are the co-opted, a pack of Caribbean and Central American nations that have turned a blind eye to Mr. Maduro’s abuses in exchange for subsidized oil. And there are the ambivalent, a large and powerful group of nations that only gently criticize the government of Venezuela, if at all, for its mounting human rights violations.

On Thursday, diplomats from across the hemisphere are scheduled to convene in Washington at the request of Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, to discuss Venezuela’s descent into chaos. Key members of this organization, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and the United States, should demand that the Venezuelan government start allowing the delivery of humanitarian aid and permit the opposition to hold a referendum on whether Mr. Maduro’s term should end early.

Clearly, the Maduro government has failed to govern democratically, a commitment required of all O.A.S. member nations. Mr. Maduro has packed crucial state institutions, including the Supreme Court, with loyalists and has stymied the opposition-run Parliament at every turn. His government has kept political opponents arbitrarily jailed for years.

The calamity in Venezuela is multipronged and won’t be solved without comprehensive reforms, which the Maduro regime has been unwilling to even contemplate. The government has been refusing offers of humanitarian aid, even as Venezuelans perish in growing numbers because hospitals have run out of medicine, and food has grown so scarce that trucks and shops are routinely looted.

In the long run, Venezuela will most likely need help from international financial institutions to start addressing its runaway inflation, avoid defaulting on its loans and diversify an economy that has been perilously dependent on oil and vulnerable to its price fluctuations.

None of this is likely to happen unless the political opposition succeeds in its push to oust Mr. Maduro through constitutional means. But without firm international pressure, Mr. Maduro, whose term ends in 2019, may find a way to sabotage the recall vote.

If regional leaders fail to take a strong and united stand against Mr. Maduro, Venezuela’s crisis can only be expected to grow. That would lead to more violent political confrontations and, quite likely, an exodus into neighboring countries. Leaders in those nations should realize that this disaster is now very close to becoming their problem.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Survey: Americans remain gloomy about economy, Chinese sunny

WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans, Japanese and many Europeans are glum about their national economies. By contrast, Chinese, Indians and Australians feel positive about theirs.

Those are among the findings from a survey released Tuesday of 20,132 people in 16 countries by the Pew Research Center. Just 44 percent of Americans rated the U.S. economy as ""good,"" although that proportion has risen steadily from 18 percent in 2011. Since that year, the U.S. unemployment rate has tumbled from 9 percent to 4.9 percent.

WASHINGTON (AP) — American workers' productivity slipped in the April-June quarter, feeding into a 12 month decline in how much people are producing for each hour worked.

Productivity fell at an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the second quarter, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Over the past 12 months, productivity has dropped 0.4 percent, as labor costs and the hours worked are rising faster than the output of workers' goods and services. Unit labor costs rose 2 percent in the second quarter, after decreasing 0.2 percent in the first quarter.

The company said its turn-around plan includes boosting sales of its dermatology, eye care and gastrointestinal medicines; improving its pipeline of experimental drugs in those categories, and using its cash more efficiently. Meanwhile, the company reported a money-losing second-quarter with results far below Wall Street expectations.

EU sets new deficit deadlines for Spain, Portugal

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union has set new deadlines for Spain and Portugal to bring their budget deficits into line after both countries escaped fines for failing to rein in spending.

EU headquarters said Tuesday that Portugal is now required to correct its deficit by 2016 and Spain by 2018 at the latest.

The two countries must submit a report by Oct. 15 on how they plan to bring their deficits under the EU ceiling of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product.

Court again says New Jersey can't legalize sports betting

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Tuesday dealt another defeat to New Jersey's yearslong attempt to legalize sports betting, setting aside the state's challenge to a federal betting ban.

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling invalidated a law passed by New Jersey in 2014 that would have allowed sports betting at casinos and racetracks. The court found New Jersey's law repealing prohibitions against sports gambling violated the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which forbids state-authorized sports gambling.

2102,"In fact, Amazon is formally known as a “consumer discretionary company,” like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we’ll get back to that.

But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 — old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.

Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of “Stocks for the Long Run” and a market historian.

“AT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,” he says. “It was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies — like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide — and an awful lot of oil companies.”

In 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey — an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies — Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online — were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech’s ascendance then, as it does now.

But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it’s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That’s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.

On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.

It’s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech’s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.

These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2108,"(Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 eased from record highs on Friday as tepid data dampened investor confidence in the economy's expansion, while the Nasdaq inched up to a second straight record high close.

Among the S&P 500's biggest drags was Dow Chemical, which fell 2.4 percent to $52.33, while DuPont declined 1.9 percent to $67.66, a day after European Union regulators opened a full investigation of their $130 billion merger agreement.

The S&P materials index, down 1.2 percent, led sector declines in the benchmark index.

Economic data showed U.S. retail sales growth was unexpectedly flat in July as people cut back on buying clothes and other goods, while the producer price index fell 0.4 percent in July, the biggest drop in nearly a year.

All three major U.S. stock indexes ended at record highs on Thursday for the first time since 1999, extending a recent rally that has increased investor concern about pricey valuations.

2111,"BRASILIA/CURITIBA, Brazil — Brazil's federal police said they had arrested two people and raided properties on Tuesday over alleged corruption at building firm Queiroz Galvao, widening a sweeping investigation focused on state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA.

""Operation Carwash"" was launched two years ago to tackle price fixing, bribery and political kickbacks at Petrobras, as the company is commonly known. It has led to dozens of convictions for bribery and money-laundering, and several top politicians are being investigated.

Former Galvao Queiroz senior executive Ildefonso Colares Filho and current employee Othon Zanoide de Moraes were arrested, authorities said in a press briefing in the southern city of Curitiba. Police were also carrying out an arrest warrant against a third unidentified person.

Queiroz Galvao's press office said it was going to issue a statement responding to the accusations later on Tuesday.

The charges all fall under the types of crime encompassed by ""Carwash"" probe, including illegal campaign donations, obstruction of justice and corruption, federal prosecutor Carlos Fernando Lima told reporters.

The investigation is hunting for additional evidence that Queiroz Galvao participated in a cartel that systematically paid bribes to win over contracts with Petrobras, prosecutors said.

They said evidence already in hand showed Queiroz Galvao paid nearly 10 million reais ($3.07 million) in bribes to Petrobras executives to gain an upper hand in the public auction of projects.

Some of those bribes were also transferred as campaign donations to politicians with close links to Petrobras, they said.

In addition, authorities are investigating if Queiroz Galvao passed 2.4 million reais ($784 million)in bribes to the re-election campaign of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2006, Lima said.

A Lula spokesman said via e-mail that the campaign accounts are under the responsibility of its treasurer and the ruling Workers' Party. He added that Lula's lawyers have filed a disciplinary action against Lima for publicly raising these suspicions without enough evidence.

Lula, one of Brazil's most popular politicians and a potential contender to run for president in 2018, is due to stand trial for charges of trying to obstruct the investigation.

Investigators said they have a video that proves that the company paid another 10 million reais ($3.07 million)in bribes to thwart a congressional inquiry into corruption at Petrobras in 2009.

The ""Carwash"" probe, which has expanded to include other state firms and projects, has hobbled investment and fueled a political crisis that led to the suspension of President Dilma Rousseff in May.

Rousseff, a leftist re-elected for another four-year term in 2014, is not under investigation in the ""Carwash"" probe, but the arrest of members of the Workers' Party and other political allies sparked calls for her impeachment. The Senate is expected to vote on her removal from office in late August or early September on impeachment charges of manipulating budget data.

Police chief Igor Romario said on Tuesday the Olympic Games due to start on Friday will not hinder the investigation but acknowledged it could reduce the amount of officers available for future raids and arrests.

On July 6, police arrested 19 people as part of an investigation of a graft scheme at a nuclear power plant owned by state-led utility Eletrobras.

Queiroz Galvao was part of a consortium working on the construction of the plant, which included other major firms. But the consortium pulled out in August last year.

Some of Brazil's largest construction companies, such as Odebrecht and Andrade Gutierrez, have been accused of overcharging Petrobras for work and passing on kickbacks to executives and politicians.

They are also being investigated for graft on venues for the 2014 World Cup and upcoming Olympics.

2112,"CAIRO — Three Egyptian dailies said Monday that Cairo was proposing to IMF delegates an 18-month reform program in return for a $12 billion loan over three years to shore up its economy, but that differences remained between the two sides on how to proceed.

The reports by the privately-owned Al-Shorouk, Al-Masry Al-Youm and Al-Watan said the two sides were at odds over the size of a proposed devaluation of the Egyptian pound and the timetable for implementing some of the more politically sensitive reforms, like reducing or removing state subsidies on fuel, electricity and food staples.

According to the papers, the International Monetary Fund has rejected Egyptian requests for a delay or a staggered implementation of some of the proposed reforms.

The IMF's response, according to Al-Masry Al-Youm, was categorical and reflective of Egypt's dire economic situation and the urgency of fixing it. ""There is no time left and nothing should be put off,"" it said quoting, like the other two papers, government sources familiar with the Egypt-IMF talks that started last week in Cairo under tight secrecy.

Egypt is struggling to keep its economy afloat, amid a slump in tourism, foreign currency shortages and double digit inflation and unemployment. The government is also fighting an insurgency in the strategic Sinai Peninsula while continuing to show little tolerance for domestic political dissent. On Monday, the central bank reported a drop by about $2 billion in foreign currency reserves, down to $15.54 billion at the end of July after honoring a number of foreign debt repayments.

Egypt's economic crisis has taken on a serious political dimension, with critics now blaming President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi for exacerbating it by embarking on massive costly infrastructure projects they say have drained the country's meager funds and done little to revive the economy.

El-Sissi, in office since June 2014, counters that the projects, like a nationwide road network and an expansion of the Suez Canal, are vital if the country was to attract investors and their benefits would filter down in time. He has repeatedly vowed in recent days to shield the poor and middle class from a virtually inevitable wave of price hikes when reforms are implemented. On Monday, his government announced higher electricity charges for domestic use as part of a plan to lift state subsidies in the energy sector.

The IMF delegates, according to the three papers, see 11.60 pounds to the U.S. dollar as a realistic exchange rate. Such a rate would be nearly three pounds more than the current official rate of 8.87 pounds available at banks but close to the thriving black market rate of 12-12.50 pounds. The Egyptians, according to the media reports, want the pound's exchange rate to be only 10.60 to the dollar.

""Both sides are looking at a pound floatation, and whether it should be done in one go or gradually,"" said Al-Masry Al-Youm.

The pound's exchange rate is crucial to a country like Egypt, whose survival is heavily dependent on imports, not just of staple food items, but industrial components and raw materials to keep the manufacturing sector going. Much of the imports needed by the private sector are financed by dollars bought on the black market.

As part of the planned reforms, Egypt was considering the partial privatization of several state-owned enterprises, possibly including oil companies. These, according to Al-Shorouk, would initially earn the treasury about $10 billion.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

HIRING A survey by ADP said that private United States payrolls grew by 179,000 in July as companies like retailers and shipping companies brought on more workers. The total suggested that employers continued to hire new workers, and at a faster pace than they did in the spring, when hiring slowed sharply.

Still, economic growth has been sluggish this year, and there are signs there are not many workers available to fill jobs. Economists forecast that the government’s jobs report, which will be released Friday, will show a gain of 175,000 jobs.

2115,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Commerce Department on Friday set final anti-dumping duties on hot-rolled flat steel from Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Britain, Brazil, the Netherlands and Australia on Friday, locking in import taxes of 3.7 percent to about 34.3 percent for five years.

The ruling, which could still be overturned by the U.S. International Trade Commission, is the latest in a series of U.S. actions aimed at fighting a glut of steel imports as China's economy slows and demand remains weak elsewhere.

The department also imposed final anti-subsidy duties of 3.9 to 11.3 percent against most steelmakers in Brazil, Turkey and South Korea, but slapped 57 percent anti-subsidy duties on top Korean steelmaker POSCO and Daewoo International Corp.

The final duty rates follow preliminary determinations in January and March.

The highest anti-dumping taxes of 34.3 percent were imposed against Brazil's Usiminas, with all other Brazilian producers facing 33.1 percent margins and just over 11 percent anti-subsidy duties.

The Brazlian government has threatened to challenge the U.S. duties before the World Trade Organization.

Britain's Tata Steel UK saw its U.S. anti-dumping margin reduced from nearly 50 percent in the preliminary finding to about 33 percent, while Tata Steel's Netherlands operations faces final dumping duties of 3.73 percent.

Used in automotive applications, construction, tubing and heavy machinery, hot-rolled steel imports from the seven countries more than doubled to nearly $2 billion (£1.5 billion) last year, with the largest share, about $650 million, coming from South Korea.

The International Trade Commission is due to decide by late September whether the imports from these countries were unfairly traded and had caused injury to domestic producers.

At a hearing on the issue on Thursday before the commission, American steel executives argued that Chinese mills were overproducing steel of all types, causing a global supply glut that has prompted steelmakers elsewhere sell hot-rolled product below cost into the United States, the only market with significant demand. This caused prices to plunge and several U.S. steel mills to be idled last year.

""Globally, demand for steel is very anaemic. There is every incentive in the world for foreign producers to ship product --dump product -- into the United States,"" said Richard Blume, general manager of U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp ""Basically, they are exporting their unemployment to the U.S.""

South Korean steel producers argued in briefs in the case that imports were not to blame for the hot-rolled price drop in the United States.

Instead, they said the lower prices were due to falling demand for oil drilling pipe, lower raw material costs, and shipping bottlenecks that caused West Coast industries to turn to Asian suppliers.

2117,"WASHINGTON — U.S. worker productivity fell for the third straight quarter in the spring this year, suggesting that corporate profits may continue to decline and wage growth may remain sluggish.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday that productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, dropped at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the April-June period, extending the longest decline since 1979. Productivity fell at an unrevised 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, productivity decreased at a 0.4 percent rate compared to the same period last year, the fastest year-on-year pace of decline in three years.

Revisions to data going back to 2013 also confirmed the softening productivity trend, but strong employment gains have helped to raise output overall with U.S. payrolls growing by more than 500,000 jobs in June and July.

""The reason the economy has still been able to expand is because of labor input. Firms are hiring people at a reasonably healthy rate,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.

""However, we do not believe this can last, because strong hiring in the face of weak productivity necessarily implies a further deterioration in corporate profit margins.""

After rising rapidly in the 1990s as computers made workers more efficient, productivity has fallen as companies have been reluctant to invest in new equipment in the past 18 months given the outlook for sluggish economic growth globally.

In the long run higher incomes and rising living standards depend on rising productivity though. The U.S. economy expanded at an annual pace of only 1.0 percent during the first six months of this year, roughly half the average of the past seven years.

U.S. stock prices were little changed at Tuesday's close, near record highs set recently, as investors shrugged off the productivity data, while U.S. Treasury yields edged lower as lower productivity suggests inflation may remain subdued.

SLUGGISH CORPORATE PROFITS

Corporate profits declined 5.3 percent in 2015 partly due to the lagging impact of a strong U.S. dollar and lower oil prices, before seeing an 8.1 percent rebound in the first quarter 2016 according to government data. Corporate profits data for the second quarter will be published later this month.

The Commerce Department reported last month that gross domestic product rose at a 1.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter following a 0.8 percent rise in the first quarter.

The estimate for second-quarter GDP growth could be revised slightly up after a separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in June. The government had previously reported wholesale inventories as being unchanged in June.

DOUBTS ABOUT DATA

Productivity has increased at an annual rate of less than 1.0 percent in each of the last five years, suggesting the economy's potential rate of growth has declined, but some economists have questioned whether it is being accurately measured.

""Innovations are everywhere, in cancer research, iPhone apps, Olympic sports training, cloud computing - they are just not showing up in the GDP accounts,"" said Patrick Newport, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.

""Are we just about running in place or is the radar that measures growth malfunctioning? It's both. Productivity growth is understated. Economists are just unsure by how much.""

Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 2.0 percent pace in the second quarter. Second-quarter unit labor costs rose at a 2.1 percent rate compared to the same period of 2015.

First-quarter unit labor costs were revised to show a 0.2 percent rate of decrease, instead of the previously reported 4.5 percent increase.

Hourly compensation per hour rose at a 1.5 percent rate in the second quarter after falling at a 0.8 percent pace in the prior quarter.

""Labor compensation growth that outpaces productivity growth must either be passed through into faster price increases or squeeze profit margins,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

2119,"United States stocks rose on Tuesday as investors were relieved to hear Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, say the central bank would remain cautious about raising interest rates.

Stocks hardly budged for most of the day as investors were occupied with Ms. Yellen’s appearance on Capitol Hill and the vote this week on Britain’s possible withdrawal from the European Union.

For the second day in a row, stocks traded higher and bond prices fell as investors felt a bit surer that Britain would stay in the E.U.

Ms. Yellen told the Senate that the Fed would proceed cautiously in raising interest rates because of uncertainties facing the American economy, including a recent slowdown in job growth. Ms. Yellen’s testimony will conclude on Wednesday.

The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers.

Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx.

US stocks rise to record highs after strong jobs report

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks jumped to record highs Friday after a strong jobs report for the month of July gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favored for most of this year.

The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy.

US trade deficit hits $44.5 billion, biggest in 10 months

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit increased to the highest point in 10 months, driven up by a big rise in imports of oil and Chinese-made computers, cellphones and clothing.

The deficit rose to $44.5 billion in June, 8.7 percent higher than a revised May deficit of $41 billion, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the biggest gap between what America sells abroad and what the country imports since a $44.6 billion deficit last August.

Exports, which have struggled this year because of the strong dollar and global weakness, edged up 0.3 percent to $183.2 billion. Imports rose a faster 1.9 percent to $227.7 billion, led by a 19.4 percent jump in petroleum imports.

Consumer borrowing slows to $12.3 billion gain in June

WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumers increased their borrowing in June but at the slowest pace in 17 months as auto and student loans registered the slowest growth in nearly five years.

The Federal Reserve said Friday that total borrowing rose by $12.3 billion in June, down sharply from an increase of $17.9 billion in May. That was the smallest monthly gain since January 2015.

The slowdown in borrowing came from a big decrease in the growth of auto and student loans, which rose by just $4.6 billion in June, the weakest monthly performance since this loan category declined in August 2011.

Louisiana pols go to court blaming Big Oil for coastal ruin

ALLIANCE, La. (AP) — The oil industry has left a big footprint along the Gulf Coast, where a Delaware-sized stretch of Louisiana has disappeared. But few politicians would blame Big Oil for ecosystem abuse in a state where the industry employs up to 300,000 people and injects $73 billion into the economy. Until now.

Following the lead of Gov. John Bel Edwards, Louisiana political orthodoxy is being turned upside-down as prominent leaders of both parties join lawsuits seeking billions of dollars for environmental improvement projects.

2123,"Stock indexes made their fourth consecutive gain Friday, an upbeat finish to a week that got off to a turbulent start as investors fretted about Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.

The market came close to regaining all the ground it lost since the vote last week, ending the week up 3 percent — its biggest weekly gain since November. The main indexes in Europe posted even bigger gains this week, and British stocks recouped all their losses along the way.

Demand for United States Treasury bonds also surged this week, driving prices sharply higher. That brought down the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 1.45 percent, from 1.48 on Thursday, close to its record low.

Investors also bid up the price of gold, another safe haven.

“Clearly there is still an underlying sense of nervousness,” said J. J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “No reasonable economic theory would be telling you to buy bonds with this kind of yield. It’s more ‘I don’t care if I don’t make yield. I want my money back.’”

What are we to make of Saudi Arabia’s investment in Uber?

The desert kingdom agreed last week to put $3.5 billion into the ride-sharing service. It is one of the single largest investments in a start-up ever, and Saudi Arabia’s 5 percent stake values Uber at $62.5 billion, making it by far the most valuable pre-I.P.O. company in Silicon Valley.

But the comparisons don’t end there. For example:

■ Saudi Arabia pumps about 9.7 million barrels of oil a day, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. With oil at close to $50 a barrel, this was about seven days’ production. That doesn’t sound like much.

■ At this valuation, Uber is worth $10 billion more than Ford, $20 billion more than General Motors, and twice as much as Tesla. It’s worth more than three times as much as American Airlines, and four times as much as United Airlines. That sounds like a lot, provided Uber someday turns those make-believe values into real ones.

■ Uber’s value is about the same as the value by which Google increased in one day last July. Tech really is magical! So maybe this valuation, for a ride-sharing company that increasingly draws investors and consumers worldwide, is not so much.

■ In April, Uber agreed to pay up to $100 million to its drivers in a dispute over whether the drivers should be considered freelancers or employees. That is about 3 percent of what the kingdom just gave Uber, so it doesn’t sound like much.

■ Driving from San Francisco to San Jose, the span of the Silicon Valley, costs about $200 on Uber. For the price of its investment, Saudi Arabia could treat its entire population of 31 million to that ride, if folks didn’t mind doubling up. Or one Saudi could just go across Midtown Manhattan 2 billion times. That’s a lot.

Admittedly, some of these comparisons are absurd. It is just not entirely clear which ones. If Uber is really changing both transportation and work worldwide, maybe Saudi Arabia just bought into something bigger than we can imagine. If not, well, at these prices the failure will be a big deal, too.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

LONDON — When the Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited a promised gift of about 80 Cubist artworks from the cosmetics magnate Leonard A. Lauder in 2014, the museum hailed Cubism as “the most influential art movement of the early 20th century,” one that “radically changed the way we see the world today.”

That assessment seemed to have been endorsed on Tuesday night, when Sotheby’s sold Picasso’s 1909 painting “Femme assise” for 43.3 million pounds with fees, or about $63.6 million. It was bought by one of two anonymous telephone bidders against a low estimate of £30 million.

But although “Femme assise” set an auction high for a Cubist work — and was the highest price for any artwork sold at auction in London since 2010 — Cubism, for all its influence, is less coveted by collectors than other periods of Picasso’s career and other 20th-century movements. Cubism’s intellectual methodology and monochromatic palette have sometimes made it a hard sell.

“Sotheby’s did well with the Picasso,” said Guy Jennings, managing director of the Fine Art Fund Group in London. “It was a very strong price for a tough painting. Cubism should be the top period, but they’re not the easiest pictures commercially.”

“Femme assise,” entered by the New York real estate magnate Sheldon Solow, according to the Baer Faxt trade newsletter, had been acquired at Sotheby’s in 1973 for £340,000. Helena Newman, Sotheby’s chairwoman of Impressionist and modern art in Europe, declined to comment on the identity of the seller. It was one of several experimental portraits Picasso made of his lover Fernande Olivier in the summer of 1909 at Horta de Ebro in his native Spain.

It was the first museum-quality Picasso Cubist oil to have appeared on the market since 1997, when Mr. Lauder paid $24.8 million for the 1913 “Femme assise dans un fauteuil (Eva).”

The $63.6 million price was far below the $179.4 million paid in May 2015 at Christie’s for Picasso’s 1955 painting “Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’),” or indeed the $106 million or so that the dealer Larry Gagosian paid privately in that same month for a 1931 plaster bust of Marie-Thérèse Walter.

Tellingly, Amedeo Modigliani’s more obviously alluring 1919 three-quarter-length portrait “Jeanne Hébuterne (au foulard)” attracted five telephone bidders at Sotheby’s, pushing the price to £38.5 million, or about $56.6 million, against an estimate of £28 million. This typically stylized depiction of the artist’s ill-fated companion and muse — Hébuterne committed suicide in 1920 the day after Modigliani’s death — had been entered by a seller identified by Bloomberg News as the Syrian-born billionaire Wafic Saïd, who had bought the painting at auction in 1986 for $2.9 million, according to the ArtNet database. Unlike the Picasso, the painting was certain to sell, courtesy of a third-party “irrevocable bid.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Encouraging data on the U.S. economy and housing market helped put traders in a buying mood. The rally followed even bigger gains in Europe.

Oil and gas companies led the rally as energy prices rose. Banks and other financial companies, which took the heaviest losses in the sell-off, also surged. Health care, consumer and technology stocks also notched gains. Bond prices fell, sending yields higher.

European benchmarks had an even better day than U.S. indexes. Britain’s FTSE 100 and France’s CAC 40 each gained 2.6 percent. Germany’s DAX added 1.9 percent.

The euro and the British pound recovered somewhat, though the pound remained near 30-year lows.

Uncertainty and anxiety over the potential economic fallout from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union had roiled global markets since Friday. But investors appeared to shake off some of their jitters Tuesday. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain signaled he might not trigger a clause setting in motion the exit before October.

In the U.S., investors got a batch of encouraging economic data to consider. The Commerce Department raised its estimate of U.S. economic growth in the first three months of the year.

Earlier in Asia, markets bounced back from early losses as leaders signaled they were ready to step in with support policies. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.1 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi added 0.5 percent.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was a laggard, losing 0.3 percent. It was dragged down by companies with high exposure to Europe, such as billionaire tycoon’s Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison Holdings, which has British retail, ports and telecom investments and fell 1.7 percent.

In currency markets, the pound recovered to $1.3343 from $1.3176 on Monday. The yen eased slightly against the dollar, though it was still hovering near its strongest level in two years. The dollar rose to 102.79 yen from 101.97 yen. The euro strengthened to $1.1049 from $1.1005.

The Southern Company’s power plant in Kemper County, Mississippi, was supposed to prove that there could be “clean coal” by capturing and storing the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming. But the plant is two years behind schedule, $4 billion over its $2.4 billion budget and plagued by construction problems.

Despite the problems of this plant, many still consider carbon capture economically feasible and environmentally necessary.

Ways to save on back-to-school clothing shopping

NEW YORK (AP) — Varsity-inspired cardigans. Preppy layers. Satin bomber jackets. There are plenty of fashion trends that experts say should help pique shoppers' interest for the back-to-school season. That could provide a sales bounce for retailers after last year's dearth of mainstream looks hurt business. The trick for shoppers: taking advantage of timing and tools to stay within a budget.

In the second most-important season for retailers behind the winter holidays, families with children from kindergarten to 12th grade plan to spend an average of $673.57 on clothing, accessories, electronics, shoes and school supplies. That's up nearly 7 percent from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. The group surveyed nearly 7,000 consumers from June 30 through July 6 about their plans.

US stocks close modestly lower as oil slumps

A sharp sell-off in energy companies pulled U.S. stock indexes modestly lower Wednesday, wiping out small gains from the day before.

Another slide in crude oil prices weighed on the energy sector. Banking, health care and technology companies also declined, while consumer-focused stocks and phone companies posted gains.

Investors mostly focused on company earnings from retailers, restaurant chains and other companies.

US employers advertised more jobs and boosted hiring in June

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers advertised more openings and hired more people in June, adding to evidence that the job market has rebounded from a brief soft patch in the spring.

The number of job openings rose a modest 2 percent to 5.6 million in June from 5.5 million in May, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Still, that figure remains below the 5.8 million openings advertised in April, the highest on records going back 16 years.

Hiring increased 1.7 percent in June to 5.1 million, a solid level but below a recent peak of 5.5 million in February.

US registers $113 billion budget deficit in July

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government last month recorded the biggest monthly budget deficit since February, and the deficit so far this budget year is running 10 percent higher than a year ago.

The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the deficit came in at $112.8 billion in July, highest since February's $192.6 billion but down from $149.2 billion in July 2015. For the first 10 months of the budget year, which ends Oct. 1, the deficit was $513.7 billion, up from $465.5 billion a year earlier.

The government runs a deficit when it spends more than it collects in taxes and other revenue.

Delta struggles through third day of computer problems

NEW YORK (AP) — Delta fliers faced delays, cancellations and more headaches Wednesday as the Atlanta-based airline struggled with its computer systems for the third straight day.

More than 300 flights were canceled by the afternoon, in addition to the 800 scrapped Tuesday and 1,000 canceled Monday. Hundreds of other flights were delayed Wednesday.

Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian once again apologized for the meltdown.

He told The Associated Press that while he knew the airline needed to make technological investments — an updated mobile app for instance — ""we did not believe, by any means, that we had this type of vulnerability.""

Toxicologist on cancer warnings: State acted despite science

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Officials in North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory's administration are telling a string of misleading half-truths about the safety of well water containing a cancer-causing chemical near Duke Energy coal ash pits, a veteran state toxicologist said Wednesday, and he charged that they are the ones responsible for any resulting fear and confusion.

Toxicologist Ken Rudo's comments in a statement issued through his attorney came a day after high-ranking state environmental and health officials blamed Rudo for sowing fear about dangerous chemicals near Duke Energy sites with ""questionable and inconsistent scientific conclusions.""

The back-and-forth charges are the latest developments in a longstanding dispute over whether water in the affected wells is safe to drink.

Changes at Ralph Lauren come at cost investors are OK with

NEW YORK (AP) — Ralph Lauren swung to a first-quarter loss as it spends heavily to turn itself around, but the damage was not as bad as many had expected and its shares rose faster than any other Wednesday on the Standard & Poor's 500.

Just months after taking over as CEO for founder Ralph Lauren late last year, Stefan Larsson initiated significant changes. He is the first person other than Lauren to hold the title.

In addition to slashing costs to right the company's balance sheet, Larsson tightened its focus on the brands that made Ralph Lauren known worldwide.

While the company is shutting 10 percent of its stores, it is pushing the core brand aggressively, which has been prominent at some very high-profile events.

Wendy's says cheaper groceries keeping people at home

DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) — Wendy's is the latest major fast-food chain to report weaker-than-expected sales growth, with the hamburger company saying people aren't dining out as much because it has gotten even cheaper to eat at home.

The chain known for its Frosty shakes and square burgers said Wednesday that sales edged up 0.4 percent at North American restaurants open at least 15 months in the second quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet forecast a 2.4 percent increase.

Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor said during a conference call that customer traffic across the fast-food industry slipped starting earlier this year as the price gap between eating at home and dining out widened.

That's because lower commodity costs have kept grocery prices down, while restaurant chains may maintain or raise prices as they deal with costs for running their businesses and try to improve profit margins

2153,"Born in Toronto and raised in a Calgary neighborhood that was already a mix of cultures and languages, Mr. Nenshi grew up keenly aware of the need for civic participation. After obtaining a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard, he worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company before returning to Calgary, where he eventually became a university professor, teaching nonprofit management and marketing.

Mr. Nenshi’s journey into government reads like a do-it-yourself guide to disrupting politics as usual. For years, he pursued his wonkish passions strictly from an academic distance, writing reports on how Canadian cities, including Calgary, could become more environmentally sustainable and economically competitive. A failed run for the City Council in 2004 confirmed his role as an outsider.

But five years later, with elections for the Council and mayor looming in 2010, he began encouraging corporate chief executives, soccer moms and other Calgary residents to run. “I struck out every time,” he recalled.

Then friends challenged him to run for mayor, an idea he initially rejected. “I like research; I do the data,” he said. “I’m not the guy kissing the babies.”

But the campaign proved a tempting chance for Mr. Nenshi to turn years of public policy recommendations into action. Along with a group of volunteers that encompassed Calgary’s diverse population, the college professor created a grass-roots strategy aimed at harnessing social media’s potential to engage the city’s traditionally apathetic young and minority residents.

Branded the Purple Revolution, Mr. Nenshi’s campaign used Facebook and Twitter to discuss issues directly with Calgary residents. Supporters opened their homes for caffeine-infused parties at which the candidate spoke, and they organized huge rallies to cheer him on. While such tactics may seem obvious today, at the time they were novelties in Canadian politics. So were the results: Mr. Nenshi won nearly 40 percent of the votes in a crowded field, amid the highest turnout in four decades.

Mr. Nenshi’s zeal for change has fueled the city’s revitalization and raised its profile beyond oil and the Calgary Stampede, an annual rodeo and festival that is Canada’s equivalent of Mardi Gras in New Orleans. A few blocks from his office, gleaming, mixed-income residential and commercial buildings rise in the downtown East Village neighborhood, once home to vacant lots and high crime rates. A new library and National Music Center are set to open there soon, and dozens of food trucks now ply the streets.

Outside the city, the Calgary Film Center, which opened in May and was funded partly by the City Council, features sprawling sound stages and studio space intended to lure more film and television projects to the city. The center is a major element in Calgary’s strategy to diversify the local economy beyond the oil and gas industry, which has suffered as the price of oil has plummeted in recent years.

More than 33 miles of bicycle paths have been installed across Calgary since 2011. Despite vocal opposition and a close City Council vote, Mr. Nenshi championed a downtown bike network pilot project that was built last year and is now favored by most residents.

“Nenshi has always been the guy who can help people get motivated to bring about change,” said James Boettcher, a Calgary gelato entrepreneur who pitched the idea of food trucks to the mayor in 2011.

Mr. Nenshi said he has no desire to seek higher office. Instead, he has embraced the role of Calgary’s head cheerleader. There he was on a recent afternoon, speaking in the indigenous Blackfoot language before a crowd of film industry executives, then posing for selfies at a bar across town on National Caesar Day, which celebrates a uniquely Canadian concoction that includes tomato juice, vodka, Worcestershire sauce and clam broth. (His cocktail was virgin.)

The mayor’s popular personal style, which he says is perhaps too unscripted, comes with some risks. “My mouth still gets me into trouble once in a while,” he said. Much of that public interaction occurs on Twitter, starting when he wakes up in the morning and continuing until lights out.

“Nobody else has my password,” he said, explaining his more than 47,000 Twitter messages as a vital means of addressing constituents’ needs and improving municipal government. “If I don’t know the answer sometimes, I Google it for them.”

Mr. Nenshi is perhaps most famous beyond Calgary for his online “smackdowns.” These range from giving polite advice to a driver who demanded an end to parking tickets (“I don’t know, maybe consider not breaking the law”) to challenging personal insults. (“Your casual racism can be fun, but you really need to stop before people actually notice.”)

Still, he is happy to inspire his critics to do more than just rant online, even if that means being voted out of office. As he told one Twitter user eager for his electoral defeat: “You’ll get your chance in 2017! Better start organizing now, though.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2155,"Morning Agenda: Verizon Is to Buy Yahoo’s Core Business

VERIZON IS TO BUY YAHOO’S CORE BUSINESS Yahoo’s struggle to survive alone will soon come to an end. It has agreed to sell its core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon Communications, according to people briefed on the matter. The company, which at its peak was worth $125 billion, is now being sold for $4.8 billion. Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion of investments in Alibaba, Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.

Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, is not expected to join Verizon, but she will receive a severance payout worth about $57 million. She will have received cash and stock compensation worth about $218 million during her four years at Yahoo, according to calculations by Equilar, a compensation research firm.

The company, once a web pioneer, has now been overtaken by the likes of Facebook and Google, and will be folded into AOL, a longtime competitor that Verizon bought last year. The takeover will double the size of Verizon’s digital advertising, according to Bloomberg, which earlier reported the price of the deal.

TESLA CHIEF STICKS TO HIS MISSION Elon Musk isn’t short of projects. He is the top investor in the largest provider of rooftop solar power in the United States, runs a private rocket company and his Tesla cars have redefined how people think about electric vehicles. He also plans to build the world’s largest battery manufacturing plant, the Gigafactory, which will be unveiled this week.

Mr. Musk wants to popularize solar power and use batteries to store energy from the sun and wind to power homes, cars and business at any time of day. His save-the-world view of business and his clean energy empire are viewed as visionary, but they are not without problems. Federal safety officials opened an investigation into the death of Joshua Brown, who was killed when his Tesla Model S smashed into a tractor-trailer. And Mr. Musk’s vision matters little for Wall Street if Tesla keeps losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

While Henry Ford’s sprawling River Rouge plant transformed the concept of mass production in the 1920s, the Gigafactory, which The New York Times visited, is likely to be more of a cultural gamechanger. “He’s driving everybody else,” Jeff Nesbit, former head of legislative and public affairs at the National Science Foundation under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, said. “That’s the power Musk has.”

PANAMA PAPERS REVEAL USE OF SHELL COMPANIES BY AFRICAN OFFICIALS Yachts, private jets, Manhattan penthouses and luxury homes in Beverly Hills, Calif. All of these luxuries have been bought using the proceeds of mineral wealth. And shell companies have helped ensure that the money has bypassed the public and enriched wealthy executives and government officials. New reports on records leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca have highlighted the critical role that secret shell companies play in facilitating tax evasion, bribery and other crimes. In Africa, where these latest reports have focused, offshore finance often underlies the exploitation of mineral wealth.

Owners of the hidden companies from Nigeria alone include three oil ministers, senior employees of the national oil companies and two former state governors who were convicted of laundering ill-gotten money from the oil industry. Other shell companies were also created by the owners of diamond mines in Sierra Leone and safari companies in Kenya and Zimbabwe.

Mossack Fonseca said it should not be blamed for wrongdoing by its customers and noted that the firm had not been charged with criminal wrongdoing in nearly 40 years of operation. Read more about the latest release of Panama Papers here.

2156,"U.S. stocks surged Friday, finishing just short of a record high, as investors responded enthusiastically to a strong June job market report.

The buying accelerated throughout the day after the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 287,000 jobs last month. That was far more than analysts expected, and after weak reports from April and May, it suggests the economy and job market haven’t run out of steam.

“It was a strong report and it put to bed worries that we were seeing the job market sputter,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist for Edward Jones.

Mining and materials companies, which would stand to benefit more than other industries from an accelerating economy, took the biggest gains. Machinery makers also jumped. Only eight stocks on the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock finished lower.

The Dow Jones industrial average surged 250.86 points, or 1.4 percent, to 18,146.74. The S.&P. 500 rose 32 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,129.90. The Nasdaq composite advanced 79.95 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,956.76.

The S.&P. 500 is less than a point away from the record high it set in May 2015. The Dow, too, is close to a record. They reached those peaks before investors got worried about the slowdown in China’s economy, before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates for the first time in almost nine years, and before anyone thought Britain might really vote to leave the European Union.

While all of those concerns have hurt stocks, they have recovered. But it’s been an uneasy rally. The stocks that have done the best in the last year are phone companies and utilities, which pay big dividends and are considered safe. U.S. bond yields have set all-time lows in the last few days. Gold is at its highest price in two years.

U.S. economic growth has been steady but uninspiring, and corporate profits and revenues are in a slump. China has been shaky. The economies of Japan and Europe are weak, and the yields on some European bonds are negative as nations try to boost their economic growth.

“I don’t think investors are nearly as excited as they would typically be in an environment where stocks are close to record highs,” said Warne.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 18,200 18,100 18,000 Previous close 17,895.88 17,900 17,800 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.36 percent from 1.39 percent. That’s far below the 2.29 percent level it began the year at. When demand for bonds is high, their prices rise and yields fall. That has the effect of sending interest rates on many kinds of loans including mortgages lower, since those rates are tied to bond yields.

Among material and industrial companies, paint and coatings maker PPG Industries added $3.29, or 3.2 percent, to $106.32 and aluminum producer Alcoa picked up 48 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $9.82. Machinery maker Caterpillar climbed $2.32, or 3.1 percent, to $77.37 and aerospace company Boeing gained $2.92, or 2.3 percent, to $130.09.

Retailer Gap climbed after it said sales at stores open at least a year grew in June as Old Navy results improved. Sales at those stores are considered an important measure of retailers’ results, and Thomson Reuters said it was the first improvement in that gauge for Gap in more than a year. Analysts expected another decline this month. Gap stock rose $1.07, or 4.9 percent, to $22.70. The stock is down 8 percent this year.

Videoconferencing equipment maker Polycom said it would be taken private by Siris Capital. It accepted an offer from Siris worth $12.50 per share, or $1.7 billion. Polycom accepted an offer from Mitel Networks in April. Polycom stock gained $1.38, or 12.7 percent, to $12.25. Mitel, which will get a $60 million payment from Polycom, climbed $1.19, or 19.8 percent, to $7.21.

SIZE: 4,070 square feet

PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT: $307

SETTING: The church sits at a triangular intersection in Fletcher Place, a neighborhood and historic district at the southeast edge of downtown. Architecturally, the area is mixed, with brick commercial buildings, schools, churches and mid- and late-Victorian architecture. Independently owned shops, restaurants, tap rooms and cafes along Virginia Avenue and Fountain Square are within a few blocks, part of a general resurgence of the neighborhoods around downtown. (Chefs at two of the restaurants, Milktooth and Bluebeard, were nominated for James Beard Awards this year.) The Indianapolis Cultural Trail, a bike and pedestrian path, passes nearby and winds for eight miles through and around downtown.

INDOORS: The two-story unit is one of four in the church, which dates to the mid-1870s. It was converted to residences in 2012. Though sleek and contemporary, the renovation retains many of the original features, including elaborate dark wood ceiling beams and stained-glass windows, some of which are inscribed with the names of the donors. This unit has half of the building’s massive central stained-glass medallion window.

The front door opens to a living area with a ceiling reaching to the roofline, nearly 35 feet. A built-in 75-inch television is next to a sleek gas fireplace, both of which are set into a wall of unusual dimpled white tile. The space has a Dolby surround sound system with a built-in wall subwoofer. The rest of the unit is wired for sound, too.

The floor plan is open, leading from living area to dining area and the kitchen. The kitchen is anchored by a 15-foot island with a Caesarstone countertop. The fire-engine red cabinets are finished with Thermofoil, a heat-sealed plastic with a metallic sheen. The stainless-steel appliances include a Sub-Zero refrigerator, an Asko dishwasher and twin Bosch ovens. There are also an icemaker and a Marvel beverage cooler.

Two of the bedrooms are at the back of the first floor. One, used as an office, is partitioned by a sliding-glass door, and has a built-in 55-inch television wired to double as a computer monitor.

On the second floor is a skylit loft with a pitched ceiling girded by the original beams and trusses. The room, used as a den, is enclosed by a stainless-steel banister continued from the stairs, and overlooks the living room.

HOW MUCH: $1,250,000

SIZE: 4,584 square feet

PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT: $273

SETTING: Austerlitz is a rural town of fewer than 2,000 people in Columbia County in upstate New York, on the Massachusetts border. This contemporary is off a winding country road, near properties that range from about 20 to 40 acres. Hiking and outdoor recreation in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts are within about 20 miles, as is Hudson, N.Y., where there is an Amtrak stop. By car, Austerlitz is about 130 miles from New York City and 140 miles from Boston.

INDOORS: The house was designed by Parker Bloser, an architect. The exterior is Ground Face concrete, with copper roofing. Set on a hillside with broad views of the Berkshires, it was built in 1988 and updated in the late 1990s. The house was a longtime home of Arthur T. Hadley, a journalist and author known for his military critiques, who died in 2015.

The interior has radiant-heated bluestone floors, vaulted pine-paneled ceilings and clean-lined wood built-ins throughout. The two-story structure has an entry level with a spacious dining area, a kitchen and a pantry, while the living room and the bedrooms are on a lower level that follows the grade of the land.

The kitchen has been updated with a Gaggenau range and Sub-Zero refrigerator. The pantry opens to the courtyard so as to make the kitchen easily accessible to caterers.

The stock market fell for a fifth straight day Wednesday as investors set aside the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision and remained focused on next week’s vote on whether Britain would remain in the European Union.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,071.50, and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.62 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,834.93.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,640.17.

As expected, the Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates unchanged at their current level of 0.25 to 0.50 percent. In its statement, the Fed said that while United States economic activity continued to strengthen, “the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed,” a reference to the April and May job reports that were weaker than anticipated.

Kristina Hooper, head of United States investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors, said after the decision was announced, “They needed to hit the pause button for June, but I think a July rate hike still remains a distinct possibility.”

United States government bond prices remained high, keeping yields low. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.58 percent from 1.61 percent a day earlier. Bond investors said the uncertainty about the British vote had forced European investors to buy up United States government bonds in a search for yield and security, pushing bond yields to their lowest levels in years.

“We are in a rare moment where the highest-quality creditor, the United States, is also the creditor with the highest interest rate,” said Brandon Swensen, senior portfolio manager and co-head of United States fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management.

Most investors remained focused on the other side of the Atlantic. There is considerable uncertainty about whether British voters will choose, in a June 23 referendum, to leave the European Union, referred to as a Brexit. The repercussions of such a move are not clear.

During her news conference, the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said the coming vote was one of the reasons the central bank kept interest rates unchanged.

Ms. Hooper of Allianz said a potential Brexit had “not loomed as large with investors as it should have.”

In economic data, the Fed said on Wednesday that industrial output — which includes factories, mines and utilities — dropped 0.4 percent from April. The decline reversed the 0.6 percent gain seen between April and March, an improvement that was taken as a sign the industrial economy was turning around.

“The industrial side of the U.S. economy remains under pressure,” said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group.

Manufacturing fell 0.4 percent last month, as motor vehicle production tumbled 4.4 percent. Mining production rose 0.2 percent, helped by a rebound in coal, but remained down 11.5 percent from a year ago. Utilities slipped 1 percent.

In a separate report, the Labor Department said that its Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, increased 0.4 percent in May after a 0.2 percent rise in April. It was the biggest gain since a similar 0.4 percent increase in January.

Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, was up 0.3 percent in May, an acceleration from a modest 0.1 percent rise in April, indicating that inflation, which has been below the Fed’s preferred 2 percent pace, could be starting to accelerate.

Among individual companies, Whole Foods Market shares fell $1.62, or 5 percent, to $30.90 after the Food and Drug Administration said there were “serious violations” at a kitchen in Massachusetts that may have resulted in contaminated food and the grocery chain had not done enough to fix them.

Benchmark United States crude oil fell 48 cents to close at $48.01 a barrel in New York. The price has fallen 6.3 percent over the last five days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 86 cents to close at $48.97 a barrel in London.

In other energy commodities, wholesale gasoline futures fell 2 cents, to $1.50 a gallon; heating oil closed down 2 cents, to $1.48 a gallon; and natural gas fell 1 cent, to $2.595 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The dollar fell to 106.01 yen from 106.12 yen. The euro edged up to $1.1251 from $1.1204.

Gold prices rose 20 cents, to $1,285.80 an ounce.

2171,"Stocks rebounded from an early slide Thursday, nudging the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite to their highest closes of the year.

Health care companies led the comeback. Energy stocks declined the most after a meeting of OPEC ministers ended without an agreement on crude production cuts.

The late-afternoon reversal delivered the second gain in two days for the stock market in what’s been a muted week of trading.

Investors have been waiting for clues as to whether the Federal Reserve will raise its key interest rate at its next meeting later this month. Many will be looking to Friday, when the Labor Department releases its latest monthly jobs report.

“It is the last major data point for the Fed to digest before they go into their mid-June meeting,” said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the U.S. Bank Private Client Group.

The S&P 500 index added 5.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,105.26. The last time it was higher this year was on April 20. The index is now about 1.2 percent below its nominal high set in May last year.

The Nasdaq rose 19.11 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,971.36. That eclipsed its previous high this year on April 18.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 48.89 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,838.56.

Seven of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 posted gains, led by health care companies. Health insurer Humana climbed the most in the index, adding $9.96, or 5.6 percent, to $187.36. Drugmaker Endo International rose 82 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $17.44. And Aetna gained $4.74, or 4.1 percent, to $120.03.

Major stock indexes had been stuck in the red for much of the day as investors monitored the OPEC meeting in Vienna. Oil ministers ended the meeting without reaching a consensus on regulating supplies. That sent crude oil prices lower initially, but they later reversed course.

Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, to close at $49.17 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 32 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $50.04 a barrel in London.

“OPEC taking a pause or choosing not to institute any production caps was not surprising given the fact that we’ve seen oil come up near $50 a barrel,” Mr. Northey said.

Even so, energy stocks were the biggest laggard in the S.&P. 500. Shares in several oil drilling and exploration companies declined, with Diamond Offshore Drilling sliding the most. The stock lost $1.01, or 4 percent, to $24.30.

Investors also weighed the latest company earnings and deal news. L Brands, the company behind the Victoria’s Secret brand, rose 4.3 percent after it reported its latest sales figures. The stock added $2.92 to $71.33.

2173,"LONDON — South African retailer Steinhoff raised its agreed offer for Britain's Poundland to 610 million pounds ($790 million) and said the revised terms were final, challenging investor Elliott Capital to back the deal or risk its collapse.

Poundland's board had recommended an earlier 597-million-pound offer from Steinhoff, which holds 23.6 percent of the British discounter's share capital, on July 13.

A day later activist U.S. hedge fund Elliott revealed it held 13.2 percent of the company, sending its shares higher on the expectation that Steinhoff would have to sweeten its bid. Elliott has since increased its Poundland holding to 17.5 percent, making it the company's second largest investor.

""By offering Poundland shareholders an improved cash offer we aim to bring certainty to the transaction, recognising the strength and value of the business,"" Chief Executive Markus Jooste said in a statement on Thursday.

Elliott declined to comment.

The fund's stake is potentially big enough to block the deal as Steinhoff requires the support of 75 percent of Poundland shareholders, not including its own holding, for the deal to go through.

But given that the revised offer has been agreed with Poundland's board and Steinhoff maintains it is final, analysts expect the deal to proceed.

""We continue to believe this is a good offer for Poundland shareholders and comes at a time when there is more downside risk than upside. ... We would advise shareholders to accept the offer,"" said analysts at brokerage Liberum.

Elliott, a $28-billion hedge fund founded by American billionaire Paul Singer, has a track record of buying stakes in companies in play and then getting bidders to increase their offers - a process which has been dubbed ""bumpitrage"".

The firm was among investors that helped force Anheuser-Busch InBev to raise its $100-billion-plus bid for rival brewer SABMiller last month.

The fund, which successfully helped lead international investors to seek repayment of Argentinian bonds, also compelled PulteGroup to appoint new directors and built a 6 percent stake in Dragon Oil to push for a higher takeover offer.

""As one of the biggest activist campaigners out in the hedge fund industry, they have the ability to back their convictions very aggressively and patiently,"" said Mohammad Hassan, head of hedge-fund analysis at Eurekahedge.

KEEN TO GROW

Steinhoff, which sells low-priced beds and cupboards in Europe, southern Africa and Asia and owns the Bensons Beds and Harvey's furniture chains in Britain, is keen to grow its European business at a time when consumers are turning to cheaper chains and its home market is struggling.

It said it is now offering 227 pence in cash for each Poundland share, comprising an offer price of 225 pence and a final dividend of 2 pence.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The revised offer represents an increase of 5 pence per share over last month's offer of 220 pence and the dividend.

Poundland, which as its name suggests sells every item in its UK stores for a pound, listed at 300 pence in 2014. Its shares have lost 37 percent of their value over the last year, hit by weak sales and the distraction of integrating the 99p Stores chain it bought for 55 million pounds.

On Thursday, its shares were unchanged at 221.75 pence.

""The 5 pence rise in the Steinhoff bid for Poundland is a pretty modest victory for shareholder activism,"" said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb.

The Poundland deal should be third time lucky for Steinhoff after it failed to secure Britain's Home Retail, which owns Argos, and was unsuccessful in a bid for Darty in France.

The company, whose largest shareholder is South African billionaire Christo Wiese, has a reputation for buying underperforming companies that can benefit from its wide global network to source goods at lower prices.

On Monday it purchased debt-laden Mattress Firm, the largest U.S. specialty bedding vendor.

Buying Poundland would give Steinhoff more than 900 shops in Britain, Ireland and Spain.

All other terms and conditions of its offer remain unchanged from last month's deal.

SOFIA, Bulgaria — WILL Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia, elect the next president of the United States? My guess is not. But reading the avalanche of commentary about Russia’s alleged interference in American politics, one might think otherwise.

It reminds me a bit of the Russian satirist Victor Pelevin’s absurdist novella “Operation Burning Bush.” The story follows a humble Russian English-language teacher, endowed with a powerful voice, who is recruited for a special intelligence operation: to speak with President George W. Bush through an implant in the president’s tooth. Following the Kremlin’s instructions, the teacher, pretending to sound like God, gives the 43rd president the idea to invade Iraq. Later in the novel, we find out that in the 1980s, the Central Intelligence Agency conducted a similar operation — this time posing as Lenin’s spirit to convince Mikhail Gorbachev to initiate perestroika, setting off a chain of events that ended with the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

The C.I.A. didn’t actually do that, though it certainly engaged in its share of harebrained Cold War schemes. But in putting the two plots in contrast, Mr. Pelevin highlights the degree of paranoia that haunts Moscow — everything bad that happens in Russia is a result of an American covert operation. And while Mr. Pelevin wrote his story before the current American presidential campaign, it seems his point goes both ways.

It’s hard to underestimate the extent of Russia’s anti-American paranoia. Russia’s leaders take it as an article of faith that the mass protests in Moscow in 2011 and 2012 were orchestrated from abroad, and that Ukraine’s Euro-Maidan revolution in 2013 and 2014 was generated with Western resources and inspiration. Even the declining price of oil is, to them, a C.I.A. plot.

There’s a kernel of common sense in their madness. In an interdependent world where the borders between foreign policy and domestic politics are increasingly blurred, it follows that interference in the domestic politics of your adversaries — even your neighbors — is an easy and acceptable part of the game.

Still, it is striking just how far the same conspiratorial thinking has permeated the West. Commentators see Mr. Putin behind everything from Brexit and the wave of euroskepticism in Western Europe to the rise of Donald J. Trump in America. As sweeping as the Kremlin’s faith in Western malfeasance is, so, too, is the West’s “Putin panic.”

Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Of course, as the joke goes, just because you’re paranoid, it doesn’t mean they aren’t after you. It makes sense that Mr. Putin wants Mr. Trump to be the next American president (though he should be careful what he wishes for). And Democrats have every right to be concerned about possible meddling by Moscow in their party’s internal politics.

But it requires an astounding level of exaggeration to believe that Russian interference will decide the election, or that Russia would even try to. The Kremlin’s actions are more akin to a black-arts version of the “democracy promotion” that the United States undertakes in countries like Russia, funding liberal NGOs as a way of challenging Mr. Putin’s monopoly on power. Annoying, and concerning, but hardly a threat.

The real problem is where the paranoia takes you. Western politicians and commentators are disturbingly eager to blame the impact of Russian propaganda or the manipulations of the Federal Security Service for the problems of our democracies. Mr. Putin obviously will benefit from Brexit, and may even have put a finger on the scale, but is that really the problem? And do we really believe that Mr. Trump’s xenophobic appeal would collapse overnight if the Kremlin put its power behind Hillary Clinton?

What is disturbing with the “blame Putin” stance endorsed by serious Western politicians, analysts and news media outlets is that it makes the Russian leader appear omnipotent while making the rest of us seem impotent. Casting blame in Moscow’s direction prevents us from productively discussing the grave problems we face as societies, and simplistically reduces the uncertainties and risks of an increasingly interdependent world to the great powers rivalry. It neither helps us better understand Russia and the nature of its government, nor makes it easier for us to have effective policy vis-à-vis Moscow.

Putin panic also unintentionally validates the Kremlin’s claim that Russia is strong and run by a great leader, at a moment when the Russian government fails to provide economic prosperity and social justice at home. It unwittingly amplifies Mr. Putin’s propaganda machine by fortifying Russia’s image as the world’s geostrategic ninja, disrupting elections and information networks without leaving a trace.

A “blame Putin” message is not only a propaganda trap; it is also questionable electoral strategy. Recent Pew Research Center surveys show that while most Americans and Europeans view the Russian president negatively, Americans do not feel particularly threatened by Moscow. What generally worries them are terrorism, radicalized Islam, cyberattacks, job loss, cheap Chinese exports and, above all else, migration. The obsession with Mr. Putin only strengthens the Republican message that the Democrats are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans. Mr. Trump is the candidate from hell, but our Putin obsession makes Mrs. Clinton look as the candidate from yesterday.

In today’s crazy world, keeping America sane should be the next president’s top priority. Getting over our Putin paranoia will be a welcome first step at eroding Russia’s destabilizing international influence.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2178,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Police used stun grenades and tear gas to clear protesters in the path of the Olympic torch in a poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday, two days before South America's first Olympic Games open under tight security.

Olympic Brazilian sailors earlier delivered the torch to the host city's mayor after crossing Guanabara Bay near the end of a 20,000-km (12,400-mile) journey through one of the world's largest and most diverse countries.

The flame landed on terra firma at 9:15 a.m. (08:15 a.m. EDT) while just kilometers away 450 heavily armed police battled drug traffickers to carry out dozens of arrest orders in the Alemao slum, an area near the international airport and close to the main road to Olympic venues.

Armed soldiers stood patrol on highways and on many corners throughout the iconic beach city in Brazil's largest security operation ever. Some 85,000 police, soldiers and security personnel will be deployed in Rio, more than double the amount in London in 2012, to deter both violent street crime and the threat of attacks by extremists.

Police said anti-government protesters in Duque de Caixas, on Rio's north side, threw rocks and blocked the torch's path. Police dispersed them with pepper spray and rubber bullets. A video of the incident spurred social media criticism of the police and amplified complaints that the Games ignored the poor.

A representative for the local organizing committee called the incident isolated and said the protesters had held up the torch but its route was not changed.

Three people were injured by rubber bullets, including a 10-year-old girl, local media reported.

The clash, which came a day after anti-torch protests in nearby towns and amid several days of gang violence in northern Brazil, underscored social tension in the massive country.

The world's largest sporting event comes to Brazil at a challenging time, in the midst of the country's worst recession in at least a quarter century and an impeachment trial of a suspended president. Many residents struggling with the dire economy question the wisdom of hosting the Olympics, a bid Brazil won in 2009 while the economy was booming.

""The Olympics is a waste of time. The Games did not bring any benefits to Rio de Janeiro,"" said waiter Adriano Souza, 25, lamenting the lack of public transportation to get around the sprawling, mountainous city.

Residents have faced hours of traffic jams in recent days as new express bus lanes ferrying athletes and visitors to sport venues take up highway space, leading Mayor Eduardo Paes to declare Thursday the fourth city holiday of the Games.

After picking up the torch at a local naval academy, a grinning Paes took it on its first laps through the streets of downtown Rio, known locally as ""the marvelous city."" A few protesters cropped up in the mostly celebratory crowd, which cheered to the pulse of drums and samba music.

In addition to balking at the $12 billion price tag, protesters are calling for more accountability from elected officials after a massive corruption scandal focused on the state oil company ensnared dozens of high-level politicians.

The economic malaise might have contributed to a larger excess supply of tickets before the Games' start than in London. The Rio Organizing Committee said 1.3 million tickets remained unsold on Wednesday, though nearly half of those tickets are for soccer matches held in other cities.

EARLY TEST AT SOCCER MATCH

The symbol of the Olympic Games will visit more towns and return to the city center on Thursday ahead of Friday's opening ceremony in the famed Maracanã stadium, site of the World Cup final in 2014.

Some cariocas, as residents of Rio are known, said they were eager to show the world their city is ready for the international spotlight and pleased they had largely delivered venues on time.

""It was easy to get here and there are plenty of police,"" said architect Sergio Lima e Silva, who was attending the first sporting event of the Games: a women's soccer match between South Africa and Sweden in a new stadium.

While the torch's tour through 300 cities has generally been smooth, it did spur an international outcry when authorities had to shoot a jaguar after the animal escaped from its handlers at a ceremony in the Amazon city of Manaus.

The name of the final torch bearer is a closely guarded secret, but soccer legend Pele said on Tuesday he been invited to light the Olympic cauldron on Friday and was checking availability with his sponsors.

Seven years into the economic recovery and three months before a presidential election, how is the United States economy doing? Two reports released on Friday reveal the ways in which the economy is humming along brilliantly — and the things that are very worrying.

We’ll start with the good news.

G.D.P. Better Than It Looks

The big headline about second-quarter G.D.P. was that the economy grew at only 1.2 percent, far below the 2.5 percent that analysts had forecast. But the shortfall was almost entirely because of a contraction in business inventories, which generally doesn’t say a lot about the future.

If we look at “final sales,” G.D.P. excluding inventories, the economy grew at 2.4 percent, a nice rebound from the winter months and in line with forecasts. Final sales tends to be a better measure of the underlying rate of growth, while inventories swing around without reflecting any long-term trend.

Consumers Spending Money

The largest component of the economy, personal consumption expenditures, grew at a whopping 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter. That’s evidence that a long-awaited rise in consumer spending from an improving job market and cheaper fuel prices is finally materializing. Americans are feeling a bit richer, and showing up in stores, restaurants and auto dealer lots ready to spend. For the first six months of 2016, total retail sales were up 3.1 percent over the same period of 2015.

Wages Rising More Quickly

The other good news in Friday’s economic data involves wages. The employment cost index may not get as many headlines as G.D.P., but it is an important data set for understanding what employers are spending on employee pay and benefits.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The total number was up 0.6 percent in the second quarter and is up 2.3 percent over the previous year. But the details of the report are more interesting. The wages and salary component of compensation is now up 2.5 percent over the last year; that same reading was only 2 percent in the second quarter.

It’s just one number, but it points to this conclusion: Worker pay is not just rising; it’s also starting to rise at a faster pace. And it’s coming in the form of cash compensation, not being eaten up by health insurance and other employer-provided benefits.

So Americans are starting to see bigger paychecks, and are spending that money. What’s the bad news?

Consumers Drove the Economy This Spring Contribution to second-quarter G.D.P. growth Personal consumption expenditures Net exports Business investment in intellectual property Government expenditures Business investment in equipment Business investment in structures Residential investment Change in inventories 2.8% 0.2% 0.1% -0.2% -0.2% -0.2% -0.2% -1.2% Contribution to second-quarter G.D.P. growth Personal consumption expenditures Net exports Business investment in intellectual property Government expenditures Business investment in equipment Business investment in structures Residential investment Change in inventories 2.8% 0.2% 0.1% -0.2% -0.2% -0.2% -0.2% -1.2%

Investment Shrinking

Things aren’t looking so great in the business sector. Investment in business structures, equipment and intellectual property fell for the third consecutive quarter.

A decline in investment in energy exploration, because of a drop in the price of oil and natural gas, appears to be a major part of that decline. A strong dollar is hammering American exporters, another squeeze to profits that businesses are facing as they pay higher wages.

The simple fact is that consumers are driving the economic train now, and businesses are pulling back. Eventually something will have to give — either businesses will have to increase investment to fulfill all that consumer demand, or weak business investment will translate into fewer jobs and weaker consumer spending.

And that isn’t altogether unrelated to the last, and most worrying, angle to pull out of Friday’s economic data.

Poor Productivity Growth

Over time, it is worker productivity that determines how rich a society will be: How much economic output can be created from an hour, or a day, of human labor?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This measure has been disappointing for several years, for reasons economists don’t entirely understand. But the latest data suggest it will turn out to be even worse than that in the first half of 2016.

The labor market, a downward blip in May aside, was quite strong through the first half of the year, with steady growth in the number of people working and the hours they put in. But according to the new G.D.P. numbers, the economy grew at only a 1 percent pace over the six-month span.

Yes, inventory numbers may not tell us much about the future of the economy, but they do mean that a big portion of the demand for goods in the economy was fulfilled by taking stuff off warehouse and store shelves, but not to be replaced by workers making more stuff. So in the calculus of productivity, the fact that G.D.P. growth is so low matters, despite the role of inventories.

Translation: Labor productivity fell 0.6 percent in the first quarter, according to previously released data. New data to be released next Tuesday will probably show a gloomy story.

What drives productivity is poorly understood, so it doesn’t lend itself to easy solutions. The Federal Reserve can’t magically flip a switch to increase productivity. But the new data is just the latest evidence that weak productivity growth is a grave threat to the United States’ long-term prosperity.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2180,"Strong dollar The United States dollar has been on a tear. The dollar index, measuring its value against six other major currencies, is up more than 20 percent in the last two years.

Photo

Some of this reflects good health: The United States economy is reasonably strong, with steady growth since 2009 and a 4.7 percent unemployment rate. That has led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates once and contemplate further moves.

Some of the dollar rally reflects a more negative global outlook. The economies of Europe, Japan and many emerging markets have remained exceptionally weak, making the United States look comparatively fantastic. Factor in the United States’ traditional role as the beacon of stability in turbulent times, and American assets look more attractive than their underlying economics would suggest.

Most worrisome is that there are some feedback loops between the strong dollar and economic weakness abroad. Many international companies, especially in China and emerging markets, owe debt in dollars, so a stronger dollar makes their debts more onerous and creates spillover economic weakness. And the stronger dollar is undermining American exporters, slowing growth in the United States.

Brexit is only accentuating this. The dollar index is up 3 percent since Thursday, most significantly because of the collapse in value of the British pound, but it is also up against the euro.

Impotent monetary policy The world’s central banks are well aware of these forces, of course, and are trying to combat them. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are in the middle of huge programs to try to pump money into their financial systems by buying assets. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have been delaying interest rate increases in hopes of achieving higher inflation and more solid growth.

So far it hasn’t been enough to get inflation persistently up to 2 percent or achieve sustained strong growth. And it is an open question if more of the same will change anything, particularly given that the economic challenges emanating from Britain are more because of existential questions of national identity than because of a garden-variety business slowdown.

Nonetheless, in the aftermath of Brexit, analysts and financial markets are now pricing in even slower interest rate increases for the Fed and the Bank of England, and a real possibility of yet more easing programs by the E.C.B. and the Bank of Japan.

Low interest rates Remember back in December when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates? That day, 10-year Treasury bonds were yielding 2.3 percent. Those bonds had fallen to 1.74 percent by Thursday (the Fed controls short-term interest rates directly, but longer-term rates are set in the open market).

Interest Rates Have Fallen Around the World Over the last decade, long-term interest rates have fallen most everywhere Change in long-term interest rate from mid-2006 ppt. +1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 United States Britain Germany Japan ’07 ’08 ’09 ’10 ’11 ’12 ’13 ’14 ’15 ’16 Change in long-term interest rate from mid-2006 ppt. +1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 United States Britain Germany Japan ’08 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16

In the two trading days since the Brexit vote, that rate has fallen to 1.44 percent. Other bond markets, including across Europe and in Britain itself, have also experienced falling longer-term rates. Germany, Switzerland and several other European countries even have negative long-term interest rates, meaning a person who buys a bond and holds on to it will lose money.

That’s very much related to the decline in investors’ expectations for lower inflation and more central bank activism. But it may also reflect a “fear premium” as investors throw money into anything that seems safe — even if it means they are guaranteed to lose money.

Weak growth This is the underlying story behind all of these other market currents. Europe is only now returning to its 2007 level of economic output; Japan’s growth is so low it is constantly bouncing in and out of recession status. In developing markets, Brazil is in recession and China is slowing. Britain and the United States are doing better, but only by the diminished global standards of the 21st century.

You can have endless debates about the underlying causes. Is this the inevitable result of a lull in productivity growth, a result of bad policy or bad luck, or some mix? Either way, the reality is that the global economy seems locked into lower growth than had been the norm in the decades before 2007.

Britain’s E.U. vote raises the risk of further dragging down that growth rate, particularly if there is a prolonged period of uncertainty around the country’s fate or a permanent breakdown in the trade ties that make an economy richer.

Political instability All of this is creating a toxic political environment in much of the advanced world, driving greater polarization and the flocking of voters to candidates outside the mainstream.

Brexit is the most recent example, supported as it was by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. The rise of right-wing nationalist parties in Continental Europe is another prime example, as are the popularity of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders in the United States; Jeremy Corbyn in Britain; and the far-left Podemos party in Spain.

Of course, less conventional politicians could turn out to succeed at generating stronger economic conditions where parties of the center have failed. But if nothing else, the widening of the ideological spectrum creates a wider range of possible outcomes — including some that would surely be very negative for financial markets and the global economy.

Again, none of these stand in isolation. Each is deeply related — either as cause, effect or both. And each has been pushed further by Britain’s choice. Where the cycle ends, and when, no one knows.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

J.C. Penney reports smaller quarterly loss as sales improve

NEW YORK (AP) — After a tough start to the year, J.C. Penney's business enjoyed a bounce in the second quarter, fueled by efforts to bring back appliances and spruce up other sections of the store.

The Plano, Texas-based department store chain reported a smaller loss for the second quarter compared to a year earlier as sales improved. CEO Marvin Ellison believes the company can maintain the momentum with a slew of new brands and other enticements coming in the next few months.

In addition to its own efforts, Penney is benefiting from store closings by Macy's and Sears Holdings Inc. Ellison told analysts Friday the company has seen sales improve in malls where its rivals shuttered their stores.

Fox News names Abernethy, Shine as co-presidents

NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News Channel founder Rupert Murdoch on Friday appointed two longtime Fox executives as the new co-presidents of the news network as it restructures after last month's departure of Roger Ailes following sexual harassment allegations.

Both Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine were with Fox News when it started in 1996. Shine, who had been one of Ailes' top deputies, will run the editorial operations for Fox News and its sister Fox Business Network. Abernethy had left the news channel to run Fox's stable of 28 local stations and he'll keep that job, while overseeing the business operations of the two networks. Both will report to Murdoch, who will continue to oversee things as executive chairman.

The moves sent a signal to Fox News viewers that despite a scandal that has widened since Ailes' resignation, they shouldn't worry that their favorite network is abandoning them.

Security experts: Remotes are hackable on many vehicles

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — A group of computer security experts say they figured out how to hack the keyless entry systems used on millions of cars, meaning that thieves could in theory break and steal items without leaving a broken window.

The experts say that remote entry systems on millions of cars made by Volkswagen since 1995 can be cloned to permit unauthorized access to the car's interior.

The same experts say another system used by other brands including Ford, General Motor's Opel and Chevrolet and Renault can also be defeated.

2185,"Yet a spectacular price for a one-off trophy could not mask the systemic issues of both supply and demand that continue to face old masters. The previous evening, Sotheby’s, which has been a dominant force in the London auction market for historic paintings, raised a modest £16.5 million with fees from its own 43-lot sale, far below the £39.3 million it took in last year.

Sotheby’s did manage to sell the finely detailed oil “Hollandaise à la cafetière” (A Dutch Girl at Breakfast) by Jean-Étienne Liotard, a mid-18th-century Swiss artist particularly admired for his pastel portraits. Billed as the last genre interior in oils by Liotard left in private hands, it was knocked down to the London dealer Lowell Libson, bidding on behalf of an institution, for £4.4 million, a high for the artist at auction.

But a 1629 still life of lemons and wine glasses by the Dutch painter Pieter Claesz with a low estimate of £1.8 million, whose seller had been guaranteed a minimum price by Sotheby’s, was among a hefty 35 percent of lots that failed (23 percent were unsold at Christie’s).

Two dealers, who asked not be named because of the confidentiality protocols of the art trade, said that the Claesz was owned by the Zurich dealer David Koetser and had previously been offered privately at Christie’s. Mr. Koetser, when asked by telephone to confirm this, declined to comment. A similar, but larger and more opulent still life by Claesz was sold by Mr. Haboldt at the 2014 Tefaf Maastricht fair, priced at $3.8 million.

“For a change, Sotheby’s didn’t have such a good sale,” said Johan Bosch van Rosenthal, an art adviser in Amsterdam who specializes in old masters. “It’s a pretty tough market at the moment. There are new people out there who haven’t got a clue, and there is a larger group of old master buyers who used to be there, but who are now buying different things.”

With demand for contemporary art cooling, and the post-Brexit pound losing about 10 percent of its value against the dollar and euro, there was certainly a sense that there were some new private buyers out there, at least at Christie’s.

But dealers, who have been struggling to sell their existing stocks of old masters in their galleries and at fairs, were conspicuously inactive as buyers at these evening sales. Christie’s said that just 3 percent of the value of its £65.4 million auction was represented by trade purchases.

“The dealers aren’t bidding,” said the London gallerist Jean-Luc Baroni. “It’s too dangerous. Everyone knows what you have paid for a painting and there are certain things that are completely out of fashion.”

Dealers were instead trying to find their own buyers at the fourth London Art Week promotion, featuring 46 galleries in Mayfair and St. James’s.

This latest edition, which ended on Sunday, showed that at least some younger dealers were eager to find ways to broaden the client base for historic art. The new partnership of Andrea Lullo and Andreas Pampoulides, for example, opened their Cork Street gallery with the exhibition, “Classicism Reimagined,” consisting of more than 20 paintings and sculptures ranging in date from the third century B.C. to 1950.

Although the gallery made at least one undisclosed sale of about £600,000, it also offered entry-level pieces, like the circa 1860 Robert Macpherson photograph of the celebrated classical sculpture “Laocoon and His Sons,” which sold for £2,500.

While the early 17th-century canvas, “A Philosopher Holding a Mirror,” by Jusepe de Ribera, priced at £1.25 million with Colnaghi, was the only seven-figure sale to be confirmed, London Art Week attracted curators from more than 40 museums, according to the organizers. For dealers, this kind of gallery-based promotion, when timed to coincide with major auctions, can be an attractive alternative to fairs.

Exceptional auction prices, such as the $44.9 million bid for that Rubens — or indeed the five-times estimate £1.1 million given by an English collector at Bonhams on July 6 for the earliest known self-portrait by the early 17th-century British painter William Dobson — create a sense that the old master market is at least ticking, if not booming.

But the salesrooms, with their powerful marketing machines, tend to attract the few new buyers for the less fashionable field of historic art, tempting dealers to sell through the auction houses rather than their own galleries.

“There isn’t a new generation of collectors yet,” said Mr. Van Rosenthal, the art adviser. “It’s about education. And people need to get over the idea of investing in art.”

But with the BBC airing programs like “The Banker’s Guide to the Art Market” on Thursday night, the latter could be the biggest challenge facing the trade in old art.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Summer sun can be glorious with its bronzing rays and natural dose of vitamin D. But along with it comes the dark spots, the photo-aging and the clogged pores. Here, three facialists who have been heating up the beauty scene with their deft skills (and celebrity clientele) suggest the best skin care remedies for the season.

Georgia Louise

Location Upper East Side (114 East 71st Street; 212-472-1400). Custom facials with Ms. Louise are $500, or try one of her associates, whose fees start at $300.

Famous Clientele The influential fashion set, including Alexander Wang, Linda Evangelista, the makeup artist Gucci Westman and the photographer Mario Testino.

Background A British expat who had an established atelier in London for years, Ms. Louise moved to New York to be with her American husband six years ago and set up shop shortly after.

Signature Ms. Louise said she’s known for her mixture of holistic (e.g. reiki, crystals and even Tibetan sound bowls) and aesthetic options (read: with machines) and will tailor the balance to the client’s preferences. “New Yorkers are more highly strung, and they want a quick fix,” she said. “When I say the appointment will take an hour and a half, I’ll often get: ‘What are you going to do in an hour and a half? I need to be in and out in 60 minutes.’ In Europe, women take more time looking after their skin and with more alternative therapies. Here it’s, ‘I’m going to a dermatologist for an injection.’”

Recommendations for Summer “I’m deep-cleansing more because people are clogging their skin with sunblock and just sweating more,” Ms. Louise said. “Your skin needs to breathe.” That includes extractions, masks tailored to skin type and blasts of saline water dispensed from a high-speed machine to clear away the gunk.

For at-home care, Ms. Louise suggests layering multiple water-based serums and toners (she particularly likes the Sérum Colostrum from Biologique Recherche, the Rehyrdating Ginseng toner from Elemis and the oil-free Hydra Repair Elixir from her own line). “Your skin is seasonal — it changes,” she said. “You do need to change your skin care.”

Aida Bicaj

Location Upper East Side (30 East 67th Street, fifth floor; 212-861-1007). The starting price for a signature facial with Ms. Bicaj is $595, although associates in her office will perform similar services for $450.

Famous Clientele The fashion set (Jenna Lyons, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen), with a few actresses (Jennifer Connelly) for good measure.

NYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.

Background Originally from Kosovo, Ms. Bicaj moved to New York in 1992. She has been working as an aesthetician for more than 20 years.

Signature “If you have good skin and good hair, you can wear anything and look like a million dollars,” Ms. Bicaj said. “I exercise skin with my hands. I believe in constant stimulation of blood circulation. If you stimulate your skin’s circulation every day, you can erase lines.”

Recommendations for Summer Ms. Bicaj focuses on calming and hydrating skin. “It’s a very strong sun out there, even if you’re just walking in the street,” she said. She may start with a gentle powder-based exfoliation before using her Manual Lift face massage techniques. She finishes the service with hydrating and oxygenating products (she prefers the Biologique Recherche line and the Beauty Drops and Crème Extreme from Future, an Israeli skin care company) depending on the skin’s needs.

To stock your own vanity, Ms. Bicaj suggests looking for balancing products. “Purifying products tend to dry out skin,” she said. “But balancing products can handle both the sun’s drying effects and the humidity.”

Shani Darden

Location West Hollywood, Calif. Ms. Darden has an office behind her house where she conducts her sessions. To schedule a custom facial ($300), call 310-745-3150.

Famous Clientele Chrissy Teigen, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Jessica Alba. Ms. Alba, in fact, was her first celebrity client when Ms. Darden was still working at the Kinara Skin Care Clinic & Spa in West Hollywood.

Background A native of upstate New York, Ms. Darden first headed to Los Angeles as a model. “It’s pretty embarrassing,” she said. “I mostly was cast in music videos.” (Some highlights include clips in LL Cool J’s “Phenomenon” and the Destiny’s Child video “No, No, No.”) She later apprenticed at dermatologist offices and spas and has been practicing as an aesthetician for the last 11 years.

Signature “I’m someone who can tackle a problem,” Ms. Darden said, adding that she favors simplifying routines rather than adding more product. “I get a lot of referrals from makeup artists who will send me someone with acne. I get their skin back on track.”

Recommendations for Summer “The problem I see the most of is people using the wrong products, such as using La Mer, which is for dry skin, when it’s really oily skin they have,” Ms. Darden said.

For the warmer months, she suggests a lighter hand all around. Avoid strong chemical peels, which can cause hyperpigmentation, she said, noting that a lactic acid peel is a mild choice. “I make sure everyone is wearing sunscreen, of course,” she said. “Also switch to lighter moisturizers, maybe gel formulas.”

Ms. Darden is partial to a small line from California called Control Corrective. She particularly recommends the Aroma Matte sunscreen, Oil Free Healing Lotion and Hydrant Stabilizer (a gel formula). If it’s acne that’s become your summer foe, she suggests heading to a trusted facialist for a session of LED lights. “I use infrared, blue and red lights,” she said. “Blue, I use especially for acne. It kills bacteria.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Stocks on Wall Street had a muddled session on Tuesday, as investors worked through a large batch of corporate earnings from a range of companies including Gilead Sciences, McDonald’s and Texas Instruments.

McDonald’s shares declined the most in one day by percentage since the financial crisis, weighing heavily on the Dow Jones industrial average.

The Dow closed down 19.31 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,473.75. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was effectively flat, rising 0.7 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,169.18. The Nasdaq composite rose 12.42 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,110.05.

The decline in the Dow was because of McDonald’s, which fell 4.5 percent to $121.71. McDonald’s reported disappointing growth in the United States. Sales rose a meager 1.8 percent from a year ago, despite the popularity of the restaurant chain’s new all-day breakfast menu.

Wall Street is in the midst of its busiest week for corporate earnings; 203 members of the S.&P. 500 are reporting their results.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Tuesday. 18,550 Previous close 18,493.06 18,500 18,450 18,400 18,350 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

This week is a big one for tech earnings in particular. Apple and Twitter reported after the closing bell on Tuesday. Google, Amazon and Facebook are to release their results later this week.

Apple shares jumped $6.33, or 7 percent, to $103 in after-hours trading. While the company reported a 27 percent drop in quarterly earnings from a year earlier, the results still beat analysts’ expectations.

Twitter, however, plunged more than 10 percent in after-hours trading after the company’s results missed expectations and the company cut its guidance for the year.

Some data showed that American consumers were feeling confident about current economic conditions.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index was essentially unchanged in July, dipping to 97.3 from a revised 97.4 in June. The business group’s index includes consumers’ assessment of the economy now and what they expect over the next six months.

And Americans bought new homes in June at the fastest pace in more than eight years, the Commerce Department reported, a sign that a solid job market and low mortgage rates are bolstering the housing market. New-home sales rose 3.5 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 592,000, the best level since February 2008.

5-Year Treasury Notes High yields at auction. 1.8 % 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.180% 1.0 ’15 ’16

The Federal Reserve started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Economists do not expect the nation’s central bank to raise interest rates from their current rate of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent, but will be looking for any signals that policy makers are looking to raise rates later this year.

An interest rate decision is expected Wednesday afternoon.

In other company earnings, the drug maker Gilead Sciences fell $7.50, or 8.5 percent, to $81.05 after the company cut its full-year sales. While the company reported sales gains in its H.I.V. drugs, it said it was facing pricing pressure and slower-than-expected demand for its most important drug, Harvoni, which cures hepatitis C, and its other hepatitis drugs like Sovaldi.

Benchmark United States crude fell 21 cents to close at $42.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 15 cents to close at $44.87 a barrel in London.

In other energy commodities, heating oil rose less than 1 cent, to $1.33 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent, to $1.35 a gallon, and natural gas fell 4 cents, to $2.71 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.56 percent from 1.58 percent. The dollar declined to 104.63 yen from 105.76. The euro edged up to $1.0985 from $1.099.

Gold rose $1.40, to $1,320.70 an ounce. Silver rose 4 cents, to $19.70 an ounce, and copper rose less than a penny, to $2.23 a pound.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Agreements for Iran to buy more than 200 jetliners from Boeing and Airbus, the most prominent commercial outcomes of the nuclear accord reached a year ago, face delays that could reduce or even unravel them, aviation lawyers and analysts said.

Legislation passed by the House of Representatives on July 7 would essentially block the multibillion-dollar agreements with Boeing and Airbus, despite provisions in the nuclear accord that allowed for such deals. While President Obama is expected to veto that legislation, it has pushed back the clock for the airplane deliveries, much to the annoyance of Iranian officials.

“I was not expecting it, but I’m not surprised, either,” said Farhad R. Alavi, managing partner at the Akrivis law group, a Washington firm that specializes in sanctions compliance. “It’s very consistent with past efforts by Congress to undermine the nuclear deal.”

Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, speaking this month at the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain, an important annual industry event, may have added to the skepticism. He said that if his company could not sell planes to Iran Air, the state-run airline, under a memorandum of agreement reached in June, then “nobody should.”

Mr. Muilenburg was alluding to the Airbus deal, which was publicized to great fanfare when President Hassan Rouhani of Iran visited France, where Airbus has its headquarters, in January.

The Iranians are also finding it difficult to find financing from foreign banks still skittish about doing business with the country. The depressed price of oil, Iran’s main export, is not helping matters.

Further doubts have been stoked by presidential uncertainties in Iran and the United States. President Rouhani, a moderate who made the ending of nuclear-related sanctions a priority when elected in 2013, is now engulfed in a scandal involving inflated government wages that could doom his hopes for a second term, with Iranian elections less than a year away.

Iran is also warily contemplating the possibility that Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president of the United States, whose disdain for the nuclear accord is well known, could win in November. Whether he would try to withdraw from the accord is unclear.

The delayed aircraft deals have sent ripples of uncertainty through the aviation industry, potentially affecting anticipated work by financial institutions, suppliers, service providers, insurers, reinsurers and others, according to lawyers knowledgeable about how large aircraft purchase contracts are handled.

Iranian aviation officials, impatient to begin rejuvenating the country’s aging fleet of 250 aircraft — of which more than a third are said to be grounded — have hinted they may go elsewhere to buy planes.

The Iranians have expressed interest in a midsize jet under development by Japan’s Mitsubishi conglomerate, Reuters reported recently. In another possible sign of reduced expectations, there is speculation that the Iranians may cancel orders for 12 Airbus A380 jumbo jets, part of the 118-plane deal with Airbus that Mr. Rouhani announced seven months ago.

Doubts also have emerged about whether Iran can lease new planes as an alternative, or a supplement, to buying them.

Industry analysts say leasing companies could have difficulties repossessing the planes in the event Iran is found to have violated the nuclear accord or to be using the planes for purposes other than civilian transportation.

Iran has not signed the Cape Town Convention, an agreement on international procedures for recovering “mobile assets” like aircraft.

“A lot of people who lease planes will look at that and say, ‘No, thank you,’” said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.

Mr. Aboulafia also expressed skepticism about the possibility of Iran’s becoming an important customer to either Boeing or Airbus. Most of the international routes to Iran have been claimed by airlines in neighboring Persian Gulf states, with service and reliability that Iran will have trouble matching.

“Iran’s jetliner requirements could be real, but only if Tehran also agreed to reform its miserable state-owned economy, create private-sector airlines and adhere to international finance norms,” Mr. Aboulafia wrote in an opinion piece published July 7 in Aviation Week, an industry magazine. “There are no plans to do anything like this.”

Even under a newly relaxed sanctions regime stipulated by the nuclear accord, both Boeing and Airbus need licenses from the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to sell aircraft to Iran. Airbus planes use American parts that are subject to United States government approval.

Both Boeing and Airbus have repeatedly said they are awaiting the licenses and cannot proceed without them. Treasury officials have declined to comment on when the licenses might be issued.

Boeing has rejected accusations by some congressional critics that its desire to sell airplanes to a country hostile to the United States is wrongheaded.

“Basically what we’ve told them is, ‘Look: The U.S. government and five other governments negotiated this agreement. Airplanes were a part of it,” Tim D. Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said in a telephone interview.

He also suggested that Boeing was not prepared to relinquish any competitive opportunity to Airbus concerning the Iranian market. Iranian aviation officials have said they will need 500 planes in coming years.

“If Airbus were able to go into that market and we weren’t able to be in there, too, and if Iran stays on the straight and narrow path and the moderates prevail politically and the market really grows in years ahead,” Mr. Neale said, “they would have that market to themselves.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2198,"BlackRock's nearly $5 trillion in managed assets mean that it is often a top investor in many of the companies buying back their shares, giving it an outsize voice on whether that strategy is the right one.

""Larry Fink’s letters demonstrate that leadership. We hope it's not all posturing,"" said Brandon Rees deputy director of the office of investment for the AFL-CIO, of Fink's efforts.

The AFL-CIO is the largest federation of U.S. labor unions and sponsored a resolution at Illinois Tool Works that, like Domini’s 3M resolution, called on the company to exclude the impact of share repurchases from executive pay calculations.

The resolution failed, with 95 percent of votes cast against it. It is unclear if BlackRock, a top five investor in the equipment maker, voted for it. The company does not comment on how it votes or its engagement with individual companies, and public filings showing its votes are not yet available.

Rees said while he admires Fink's sentiments, BlackRock does not release enough detail to fully evaluate whether BlackRock's engagement with particular companies has much impact.

Fink, who was not made available to comment on this story, does not think all buybacks are bad. Some may be a prudent use of excess capital, and BlackRock itself has been buying roughly $275 million of its own shares every quarter, he has said.

Spokesman Ed Sweeney said when BlackRock has concerns about a company's direction or corporate governance, it meets with directors and executives privately to ""catalyze positive changes,"" and votes against management when talks fail. He added that capital allocation matters like buybacks are just one of many areas it considers in its proxy voting process.

In one case, BlackRock withheld support from two directors at ""a large oil and gas corporation"" this spring after the company -- which it declined to name -- did not make board members available to explain their strategy and capital allocation decisions, according to its website.

It also did not support a member of Discovery Communications Inc's compensation committee last year after the company awarded its CEO the largest pay package in the S&P 500, according to securities filings.

To guide those decisions, BlackRock turns to a team of 22 people who determine how to vote on thousands of ballot items each year at U.S. companies' annual meetings. Sweeney said that this division, headed by Michelle Edkins, is independent and votes in accordance with, ""our fiduciary duty to our clients."" BlackRock did not make Edkins available to comment.

Matthew Weatherley-White, managing director of investment adviser Caprock Group, said BlackRock cannot vote too aggressively because many clients would not share Fink's views. For instance, choosing to buy back shares can boost shareholder returns in the short-term because it raises earnings per share.

""Fink is sincere, but structurally they have a hard time following through,"" Weatherley-White said.

THE POWER OF THE VOTE

S&P 500 firms are purchasing $445 billion in stock over the last 12 months of earnings reports, matching the previous year's peak. Add in dividends, and the total of $838 billion spent surpasses total capital expenditures of $707 billion in that time, according to a Reuters analysis

Much of BlackRock's nearly $5 trillion in managed assets is in passive investment products that buy and hold stocks only because they are in a particular index. That means that proxy votes are one of the few ways of expressing displeasure with a company. Actively managed funds can sell a company's stock anytime they become dissatisfied.

""As an index fund owner, you have to own some really crummy companies"" that happen to be in an index, Fink said at an investor conference two years ago. The ""only power you have is your vote,"" he said.

But BlackRock rarely exercised that power. In last year's proxy season, BlackRock funds opposed five percent of resolutions to approve share buybacks or repurchases, according to Proxy Insight's analysis for Reuters. To be sure, that was a stronger record than some rivals like Vanguard Group or T. Rowe Price, which opposed the resolutions one percent of the time and 2.7 percent of the time, respectively.

Both T. Rowe Price and Vanguard declined to comment.

BlackRock's Global Opportunities Fund, for instance, opposed management on just two of 85 resolutions in that period, including at construction firm Bouygues SA and distiller Remy Cointreau. BlackRock's Sweeney declined to discuss the votes, but proxy adviser Glass, Lewis had recommended against both measures on concerns they could be used to thwart takeover attempts.

Filings analyzed by Proxy Insight for Reuters also show that of the 30 S&P 500 companies that bought back the highest proportion of their stock in 2014, funds run by BlackRock supported those companies' directors about 97 percent of the time the following year, the most recent period available. That is roughly as often as they supported S&P 500 directors overall.

Public filings showing BlackRock's votes on specific directors and shareholder proposals this year are not yet available, including Kanzer's 3M resolution on buybacks.

Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services did not support the change at 3M or at Illinois Tool, which is a blow since backing from ISS can add an extra 30 percentage points or so to the support level for a typical shareholder proposal, according to pay consulting firm Semler Brossy.

But Kanzer was counting on Fink's BlackRock to back him up.

""Considering the helpful things Larry Fink has been saying about excessive share buybacks, we had hoped to see BlackRock underscore that message through its proxy voting,"" said Kanzer of Domini Social Investments, an investment adviser that specializes in socially responsible investing and sponsored the 3M resolution.

Kanzer noted that his resolution at least prompted 3M to offer more disclosure around its rationale for the buybacks, and said he had a ""productive conversation"" with 3M management.

Will Domini re-submit similar resolutions at 3M and elsewhere next year?

""Still thinking about it,"" he said.

(Additional reporting by David Gaffen and Trevor Hunnicutt in New York; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Edward Tobin)","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2199,"NEW YORK — U.S. stocks jumped to record highs Friday after a strong jobs report for the month of July gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favored for most of this year.

The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy.

""It looks like the economy is improving, it looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing,"" said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the U.S. would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher over the last few months.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1 percent, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,221.12.

The strong jobs report suggests that Britain's vote to leave the European Union in late June didn't have much effect on hiring plans for U.S. companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May.

Banks rose the most, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $15.05 and Citigroup added $1.88, or 4.3 percent, to $45.72.

Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but won't vanquish their fears entirely.

""With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest,"" she said.

The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy's strength warrants it. July's report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating.

""When the Fed indicates that they're data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well,"" she said.

Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to 1.59 percent from 1.50 percent.

Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up $3.25, or 3.8 percent, to $88.79.

After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank $12.04, or 16 percent, to $63.28 after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study.

Last Tuesday, a farm-to-table subscription service called Local Roots NYC dropped off boxes at pickup spots in New York City including a cafe, a brew pub and the offices of BuzzFeed.

Alongside locally grown rainbow chard, romaine lettuce and beets, some members got bottles of olive oil from Italy or bars of chocolate and bags of dried pasta, both Brooklyn-made. From Rustic Roots, an organic-food delivery service in the tristate area, members could receive fruit boxes stacked with oranges, pineapples and avocados.

Although both companies use the term “C.S.A.,” community-supported agriculture, to describe their service, the presence of a middleman between the farmer and the customer is precisely what traditional C.S.A.s are designed to avoid. And since olives and oranges do not grow in this region, those products provide no direct income to local farmers, precisely the people the C.S.A. was invented to benefit.

Community-supported agriculture was originally defined by a very particular relationship between a farm and its customers. Starting in the 1980s (earlier in Europe and Japan), members banded together to support a nearby farm with an upfront financial commitment to buy its produce.

It was a private transaction in which all the money went directly to the farmer. It did not rely on distributors or brick-and-mortar stores, and it gave farmers a crucial infusion of cash for the winter, used to buy seeds, repair equipment and expand into new growing methods.

The goal was for C.S.A. farmers and members to build a mutually supportive long-term relationship. Members would get straight-from-the-farm produce from a farmer they knew and trusted, and farmers would get financial stability.

“There’s no other customer that pays you 100 percent, in advance, year after year,” said Maggie Wood, an owner of Golden Earthworm Farm on the North Fork of Long Island. Ms. Wood’s farm is entirely supported by its 2,150 C.S.A. members.

As demand for local and organic produce has ballooned in the last five years, so have other ideas for connecting farmers to customers. Now, online hubs are using sophisticated distribution technology to snap into the food chain, often using “C.S.A.” to describe what they deliver.

The term is not regulated in most states, so companies can define it as they wish. Peapod, the online shopping service owned by the international grocery giant Ahold, delivers farm-sourced boxes throughout the Northeast; FreshDirect offers a variety of C.S.A. options in and around New York City.

As the “farm share” concept has spread, the C.S.A. has become just another part of the sprawling, messy modern system of knowing where your food comes from and choosing what you want to eat.

The opportunity for confusion is of enormous concern to many farmers in the New York region. Depending on how and where these new businesses buy their produce, consumers can receive all the benefits of C.S.A. membership, while the farmers get only a fraction. Some farmers say that after years of steady growth, their C.S.A. memberships have dropped since the arrival of services like Local Roots or Farmigo.

“At first it seemed like these services were going to be great for us,” said Eve Kaplan-Walbrecht, an owner of Garden of Eve farm on the North Fork of Long Island. Some of them supplied software management programs and marketing tools; others offered premium prices close to farmers’ market rates; others picked up the produce instead of requiring farmers to deliver to a central warehouse.

But the drawbacks can outweigh the benefits. Some say that these hubs have siphoned off their members, partly by offering a more convenient product, but also by blurring the definition of terms like “C.S.A.” and “farm share,” so that customers believe they are directly supporting local farms with their purchases when they might not.

“They are absolutely in competition with us,” said Ben Shute, an owner of Hearty Roots farm in the Hudson Valley. “There are only a certain number of people who will buy food this way.”

Ms. Kaplan-Walbrecht said that her membership had dropped from a high of 900 around 2012 to 600 today. Golden Earthworm, Katchkie Farm in Kinderhook, N.Y., and many other local farmers agree that after years of steady growth, they have been struggling to retain old members and attract new ones. And that to compete with the delivery services, they are scrambling to find sources for bread, cheese, fruit, meat, eggs and other add-ons that customers want.

“Do consumers even know that when they sign up for one of these fake C.S.A.s, sometimes it doesn’t benefit local farmers any more than if they shop at the supermarket?” Ms. Kaplan-Walbrecht asked.

Probably not. The organic farm boxes you buy online may or may not be local. Local farm boxes may or may not be organic. The farmers may or may not be paid more than wholesale prices. And customers may or may not care.

“I just assume that if it’s organic, it’s good,” said Raquel Hoffman, a C.S.A. member in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. “I can’t also worry about whether it’s local, or whether the chickens were happy, and all that.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

Eat Well A weekly column on the science and culture of eating.

Healthful, fast and affordable food is the holy grail of the public health and nutrition community. A popular restaurant chain shows just how much of a challenge that is.

It began when three Georgetown University students were frustrated that they could not find a healthy fast-food restaurant near their campus. With money raised from family and friends, they started their own, renting a small storefront on M Street in Georgetown. The result was Sweetgreen, a restaurant that offered organic salads, wraps and frozen yogurt. Pretty soon, the daily line of lunchtime customers stretched out the door and around the corner.

Ten years later, the line is still there, but Sweetgreen has grown into a nationwide salad chain, with more than 40 locations. Sweetgreen is part of a small but growing breed of farm-to-table fast-food chains – like Chopt Creative Salad Company on the East Coast and Tender Greens in California – that are giving fast-food restaurants a plant-based makeover. Their mission: to fix fast food, which has long been fattening and heavily processed.

Photo

Sweetgreen’s owners say their goal is to offer customers foods made with nutritious, sustainable and locally grown ingredients. The company has decentralized its food sourcing and production. Fresh vegetables, cheeses and other ingredients are shipped directly to each restaurant from nearby farms and then chopped or cooked on site. They don’t sell soda or use refined sugar.

Sweetgreen expects to open another 20 stores in major cities around the country this year, and eventually to expand to places where experts say healthy, delicious fast food is needed most — low-income neighborhoods.

But while the chain has proven there is a big appetite for more healthful fast food, the goal of taking this concept to poor areas may be a distant reality. The company and other chains like it operate almost exclusively in affluent communities, far from the low-income food deserts where obesity is rampant and farmers’ markets and healthy food stores are scarce. And with salads that typically cost between $9 and $14, some question whether a healthful fast-food chain like Sweetgreen can ever be affordable for average Americans.

Maegan George, a Columbia University student who lives near a Sweetgreen, calculated that for the price of one Sweetgreen salad, she could buy the same ingredients in bulk at a local market and make several similar salads at home.

“I’m a first-generation student and I’m on full financial aid,” she said. “Sweetgreen is delicious and I enjoy it. But there’s no way I could afford to eat there on a regular basis.”

Jackie Hajdenberg, another Columbia student, wrote about the restaurant for the campus newspaper, The Spectator, earlier this year, lamenting that on a per calorie basis, a salad at Sweetgreen was three times the price of a Big Mac at McDonald’s.

“Sweetgreen has not only made it easier for people to make healthy decisions – it has also illustrated the unequal socioeconomic landscape of the world in which we live,” she wrote.

Photo

Sweetgreen says it prices its food so that it can compensate its suppliers and employees fairly, and that it expects nutritious fast food to become more affordable as the healthy food movement grows. Nicolas Jammet, a co-founder of Sweetgreen, said the company wants to serve lower-income customers, and has long-term plans to expand to low-income communities.

To get there, he said, the company will have to overcome hurdles involving its supply chain, the minimum wage and greater nutrition awareness and education among the public. For the past six years the company has been running a nutrition education program in schools that teaches children about healthier eating and locally grown food.

“It’s a long-term goal for us to be part of this larger systematic change that needs to happen,” he said. “But there are so many parts of this problem that need to be addressed.”

Mr. Jammet notes that the company was among the first to show that fast-food chains don’t need profits from soda and sugary drinks to succeed. He believes chains like Sweetgreen have caused a ripple effect throughout the fast-food industry.

In January, for example, Chick-fil-A unveiled a new kale, broccolini and nut “superfood” salad, responding to customer demands for “new tastes and healthier ways to eat in our restaurants.” McDonald’s is experimenting with kale salads, and Wendy’s is testing a spinach, chicken and quinoa salad.

“Companies like McDonald’s have more power to change the way that people eat than we do,” Mr. Jammet said. “We don’t see these companies as the enemy. We just have to force change on them.”

Public health experts say that such changes cannot come soon enough. A University of Toronto study recently showed that people have a higher risk of developing diabetes if they live in “food swamps” – an area with three or more fast-food restaurants and no healthy dining options.

Another study published in JAMA in June found that the percentage of Americans eating an unhealthy diet — high in sugar, refined grains, soft drinks and processed foods and low in fruits and vegetables — was on the decline, but the improvements in diet were much smaller for lower-income Americans.

Overall about twice as many people from poor households have poor diets compared to those at higher income levels.

Why is traditional fast food so cheap? One reason is the underlying infrastructure of the industry. Many of the ingredients, like the soy that’s turned into oil for deep fryers, or the the corn that’s fed to animals and used to make high-fructose corn syrup, begin with crops that are heavily subsidized by the government. To make their food economical, many traditional fast-food chains mass-produce their food in large factories, often stripping it of fiber and other nutrients that decrease its shelf life, while adding salt, sugar and other flavorings and preservatives.

Then they freeze and ship the processed components, like burger patties, bread, pickles and sauce, to their restaurants. There they are reheated and assembled, often with minimal effort, ensuring that a Big Mac in Seattle looks and tastes the same as a Big Mac in Charlotte, N.C.

By comparison, every Sweetgreen location has a chalkboard that lists the farms where its organic arugula, peaches, yogurt or blueberries are produced. As a result, the menus vary by location and by season. In Boston, Sweetgreen stores use New England Hubbard squash. In Los Angeles, the menu features a different variety of squash grown locally in California.

Those differences mean fresher, more nutritious ingredients, but ultimately costlier food for customers — one of the obstacles that Sweetgreen and other chains like it will have to overcome if they hope to make their food more accessible to all income brackets.

Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University and the author of “Food Politics,’’ says restaurants like Sweetgreen offer an encouraging, but imperfect, model for making fast food more healthful.

“What’s not to like?” she asks. “The cost, maybe, but for people who can afford it the quality is worth it. Next step: Moving the concept into low-income areas.”

BUENOS AIRES — Havanna, a confectioner from Argentina, raised $11.47 million on Monday in the first local initial public offering by the South American nation in nearly six years.

The offering was a big step toward Argentina’s re-emergence in capital markets under President Mauricio Macri. Mr. Macri took office six months ago after a period of market isolation under the previous administration. Argentina had been cut off from global markets after a $100 billion debt default in 2001 and a long legal battle with hedge fund creditors that was resolved this year.

Argentina’s government returned to global bond markets in April, after a 15-year hiatus, with an issuance of $16.5 billion. Several of the nation’s provinces have been raising money on these bond markets in recent weeks.

Havanna, which makes alfajores, a sweet biscuit snack, and runs more than 300 coffee shops in Argentina and across Latin America, sold 4.27 million shares — 10 percent of the company — at 37 pesos per share, valuing it at around $114.7 million.

Demand doubled the number of shares offered, so they were priced at the top of the marketed range.

“There was so much demand for this stock,” said Emilio Ilac, chief executive of Puente, a brokerage firm in Buenos Aires that managed Havanna’s sale. “This is very encouraging not only for Havanna, but for other companies who want to go public.”

Despite the small size of the offering, 17 percent of orders came from abroad, Mr. Ilac said.

While initial price offerings from Argentina have been sporadic in recent years, Havanna is predicted to lead a fresh wave in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.

Already, Grupo Supervielle — the holding company for Banco Supervielle, a bank — raised $280 million last month in an initial public offering in both New York and Buenos Aires. But Havanna’s offering was the first entirely local equity offering since the oil company Petrolera Pampa’s in 2013.

Mr. Macri’s government is dealing with an overhaul of the economy, including efforts to bolster growth, rein in inflation and narrow the fiscal deficit. But if policy makers face serious setbacks, analysts say, this would suppress investor demand in Argentina.

“Sustaining this incipient interest in Argentine assets from financial markets depends on how the macro-economy evolves,” said Gastón Rossi, an economist at a consulting firm in Buenos Aires.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

LONDON — Dinosaurs make for good box office. Steven Spielberg’s 1993 “Jurassic Park” and its three sequels have become the tyrannosaurus rex of movie franchises, grossing more than $3.7 billion, and there are people of a certain age who cannot forget the sight of a pterosaur carrying off Raquel Welch in the 1966 kitsch classic “One Million Years B.C.”

But has the popularity of these cinematic creatures boosted the market for the fossilized remains of their real-life predecessors? A combined live and online sale on May 28 of fossils and minerals at Auctionata in Berlin, which included a 150-million-year-old skeleton of a stegosaurus valued at 2.4 million euros, or about $2.69 million, certainly generated plenty of publicity.

The near-complete late Jurassic skeleton, discovered in Wyoming in 2010, was one of the 90 lots in the sale, all of which were supplied by Redgallery, a specialist dealer in Hamburg.

“This was our first dedicated auction of fossils and minerals,” said Leon Dammann, the director of private and gallery collections at Auctionata, which was founded in 2012. ”We think it fits well into our portfolio of categories.”

The German firm is one of a number of companies seeking to reach new buyers over the internet. Auctions are streamed daily, and the company has an inventory of about 25,000 objects in an online shop, with fixed prices.

But media interest can be one thing, consumer spending another. During the May 28 auction, just 22 percent of the lots attracted bidding. There were no bids on the stegosaurus. The total from confirmed and “conditional” sales (in which bidders on lots that failed to meet reserve have an option to buy) was just €36,325 as of Thursday. Two lots of Jurassic snail-shaped ammonites were among the confirmed successes with prices of €3,000 each with fees.

“We wanted to find out how the new media would open up new markets for rare fossils,” said Andreas Guhr, the founder of Redgallery, who has been dealing in fossils and minerals for more than 40 years. “The result was disappointing. The market is still very specialized.”

Mr. Dammann attributed the underwhelming performance of the sale to uncertainty surrounding Germany’s proposed Cultural Heritage Protection Law, which would regulate the export of artifacts bought in the country, and a dearth of Russian bidding following the fall in the price of oil. Dealers also noted that the herbivorous stegosaurus lacks the “wow” factor of a meat-eater like tyrannosaurus rex.

Back in October 1997, when “Jurassic Park” was still the highest-grossing movie of all time, Sotheby’s auctioned the fossilized skeleton of a tyrannosaurus rex called Sue that had been the subject of a legal battle after being excavated in 1990 in South Dakota by the fossil dealer Peter L. Larsen. The skeleton sold for $8.4 million to the Field Museum in Chicago, and it remains the highest price for a fossil at auction.

“The movie certainly gave a shot in the arm to the dinosaur market,” said James Hyslop, a specialist at Christie’s, which holds hybrid “Travel, Science and Natural History” sales twice a year at its South Kensington location.

But blockbuster auction prices like that have become a thing of the past. Sotheby’s last specialist “Natural History” sale was in Paris in 2014 and brought in a total of €1 million. Bonhams holds three such sales a year in Los Angeles; in January, an iridescent ammonite with blue coloration — the sort of fossil that also appeals to interior decorators — brought a top price of $43,750.

“Because the oil money has dried up, and museums have experienced catastrophic funding decreases over the last 10 years especially, there is less demand except for the finest and most rare stuff,” said Lowell Carhart, a co-founder of the 22nd Street Mineral and Fossil Show in Tucson.

An American rival to Fossilworld Munich in October, Mr. Carhart’s event last year attracted 41,000 visitors. He said most rare fossils were sold privately to preferred clients by specialist dealers and trader-collectors, who are now responsible for more than 90 percent of excavations.

Some museums are buying fossils discreetly from dealers, rather than pay for expensive digs. In December 2014, the Natural History Museum in London put on display a well preserved skeleton of a stegosaurus it had spotted for sale at the 2012 Tucson Gem, Mineral and Fossil Showcase. The purchase price was £3 million, or about $5 million, according to two specialists with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named because of client confidentiality protocols.

When asked to confirm the price, Murray MacKay, a public relations officer at the Natural History Museum, said, “We don’t tend to disclose the size of donations for these kinds of specimens.”

Funding came from 70 donors, with most of the money provided by Jeremy Herrmann, a hedge fund manager based in London.

Some benchmark auction values should at least be established on Tuesday and Wednesday when Summers Place Auctions in Sussex offers, without reserves, the fossil collection of Emmen Zoo in the Netherlands, which has relocated and evolved into an adventure park.

The 180 lots include a near complete skeleton of a harpocrasaurus, a late Cretaceous duck-billed herbivore. Rupert van der Werff, a specialist at Summers Place, said the skeleton had been bought by the zoo in 1992 from a dealer for about $600,000. It carries an estimate of 50,000 pounds to £80,000, or about $73,000 to $117,000.

The sale, which includes lots estimated at as little as £30, also features a late Pleistocene era skeleton of a saber-toothed cat — exactly the sort of animal that might have provided the fur for the bikini Ms. Welch modeled in “One Million Years B.C.” The skeleton is valued at £6,000 to £10,000.

Mr. Van der Werff, who has been holding natural history auctions at Summers Place since 1998, acknowledges that fossils remain modestly priced and their market stubbornly small.

“We’ve never made the breakthrough to getting broader appeal,” he said. “People see them in museums and think they should be in museums.”

Mr. Carhart, the Tucson show organizer, said that large fossils’ relative illiquidity and the difficulty in moving them — the stegosaurus offered by Auctionata weighed in at about 1,900 pounds and was nearly 19 feet long — mitigate against their popularity among a wider group of collectors.

“Dinosaurs are free,” Mr. Carhart said. “What a buyer is actually purchasing is years of unreimbursed search time and thousands upon thousands of skilled hours of preparation time.

“This is why common items stay in the ground,” he continued. “Too little demand and too much preparation time make them unprofitable to excavate.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

The former wife of the Russian oil and real estate magnate Shalva Chigirinsky bought a sprawling luxury apartment in a new condominium conversion on the Upper East Side, and at $17,310,250, it was the most expensive closed sale of the week, according to city records.

Tatiana Panchenkova paid just below the $17.5 million asking price for the sponsor unit, No. 5A, at 33 East 74th Street, at Madison Avenue, a development created from 19th-century brownstones once owned by the Whitney Museum of American Art. The monthly carrying costs total $11,463.

Yana Markovski of Domus Realty represented Ms. Panchenkova, while Katherine Gauthier of Douglas Elliman Real Estate was the listing broker.

The apartment has nearly 4,000 square feet that includes four bedrooms, three and a half baths and an 18-by-30-foot living and dining area that flows into an eat-in kitchen with a 12-foot center island. There is also a laundry room and ample storage space.

The spacious master suite features a private gallery with two large walk-in closets.

The condominium complex was developed by the health care entrepreneur Daniel E. Straus, using an affiliate company, JZS Madison LLC, and was designed by the architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle. Interiors are by Champalimaud Design.

Ms. Panchenkova, who also has a home in Greenwich, Conn., has been divorced from Mr. Chigirinsky since 2009. She and her former husband have been mired in a bitter dispute over custody of children and division of marital assets, according to published reports.

The week’s runner-up sale, at $8,960,600, according to records, was another four-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath apartment — this one at River & Warren, a new Battery Park City condominium at 212 Warren Street.

Jorge Mesquita, the worldwide chairman of Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, purchased the 2,853-square-foot unit, PHN, with Susana Lobo. The monthly carrying charges are $8,822.

The sponsor apartment has panoramic Hudson River and cityscape views, according to a listing, and a 1,871-square-foot roof deck with a full kitchen. There is also a laundry room. The Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group handles sales for the building, while Brooke Joslyn of Stribling & Associates represented the buyer.

Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

2239,"Zeina, age 8, sits politely in a corner of the family's tent, occasionally fidgeting and making sounds that don't form words.

In the small, hurriedly constructed camp on the outskirts of Amiriyah al-Fallujah, a single mobile clinic only had antibiotics and mild painkillers on hand. In Baghdad — just over 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, Zeina could have access to the care she needs, but her family — as Anbar residents — lack the legal paperwork required to cross over into Baghdad Province.

""There's an assumption that after Daesh is defeated you can put the nation back together and in essence create a new nation, but that's not what we're seeing in Anbar,"" said a western diplomat based in Baghdad, referring to the Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.

Instead, industry and agriculture have ground to a halt, schools are closed, electrical grids are down and many roads remain unusable. In that vacuum, tribal politics are becoming more powerful and families are adopting more conservative habits, said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity due to a lack of authorization to release information to the media.

While Iraqi government security forces administer databases of information to identify possible IS fighters among civilians, much of the screening process is handed over to local Anbari officials and communities.

At one of the larger displacement camps in Amiriyah al-Fallujah, a crowd of women gathered around a humanitarian convoy calling for help, they all had sons who were detained while fleeing Fallujah. Two weeks after they were taken, the women didn't know where they were or who was holding them.

Detainees say that tribes and powerful families are accusing rivals of being IS sympathizers to settle blood feuds, unpaid debts and grievances that go back generations.

""Anyone who has a problem with someone can just accuse him of being with Daesh,"" said Hussein, a middle-aged man just released from a detention center, speaking on condition that only his first name is used for fear of his own security.

Anbar's residents describe feeling increasingly alienated from the central government, adrift in camps for the displaced or sharing close quarters with extended family. The vast majority of assistance that they are growing increasingly dependent on comes not from the central government, but from local political, tribal and religious leaders.

For Ahmed Fahel, 30, the fight against IS in Hit plunged his family into poverty. Living in a desolate camp further west in Anbar in the desert that lies between Hit and Ramadi, Fahel is now his extended family's only breadwinner. His brother was executed by IS fighters just days before the town was retaken by Iraqi forces and his body was dumped in the street. Fahel only had time to quickly bury his brother in the garden before they fled.

""I have nothing and I also need to provide for my sister-in-law and her children,"" he said, explaining he has since heard his house back in Hit was completely destroyed.

Nearly 1.3 million Anbaris are estimated to have been forced from their homes since early 2014 when IS first began to grow in power in the province, ferrying fighters and munitions through the lawless desserts along the border with neighboring Syria.

A decade ago, when the predecessor to IS had torn Anbar apart, a U.S.-led effort to stabilize the province built support against al-Qaeda by pouring enormous amounts of resources into existing local tribal leadership networks. Today, Iraq's central government — due in part to budget shortfalls sparked by the plunge in the price of oil — doesn't have the resources and the U.S.-led coalition doesn't have the appetite for such an ambitious undertaking.

Without similarly large amounts of money, putting Anbar back together again will be impossible, said Ahmed al-Dara, a religious sheikh from Fallujah. And beyond the issue of resources, he said, the fight against IS in his home province is fundamentally different from the fight against al-Qaeda after the overthrow of Saddam in 2003.

""This idea of reconciliation is not possible with Iraqis who joined Daesh,"" said al-Dara, explaining that recovering from this insurgency would not only drive a greater wedge between Iraq's Sunni and Shiites, but has also begun to fracture Iraq's Sunni community.

""I know the people of Fallujah and Ramadi, they will never let a single Daesh supporter return to their cities,"" he said. ""This conflict has taken Iraq's Sunnis back 50 years.""

Athab, the Fallujah resident stuck in the tented camp on Anbar's edge, describes the past 13 years of cyclical violence as exhausting.

""This is the third time this has happened to Fallujah,"" he said referencing the two U.S.-led offensives against al-Qaeda insurgents in his home town in the mid-2000s. The battle against IS this year was the first to force him to flee his home and Athab vows it will be the last.

""I don't want to live in Anbar anymore,"" he said sucking at his front teeth. ""Fallujah is finished, you can take it.""

Associated Press writers Muhanad al-Saleh, Akram David and Sinan Salaheddin in Baghdad contributed to this report.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2240,"SHANGHAI — It remains more promise than product, but the electric vehicle (EV) sector is drawing more talent from mainstream automakers which are reluctant to go full tilt at the new technology.

Making the jump can mean better pay and pioneering opportunities. One Chinese-backed start-up with around 900 employees, for example, has a $15 million monthly payroll, according to a person close to the company.

One such 'defector' is Freeman Shen, who quit Chinese carmaker Geely two years ago to launch WM Motor, an EV start-up that aims to compete with Tesla Motors in China, the world's biggest autos market and one that encourages the new technology through policy and subsidies.

While other Chinese EV start-ups including LeSee, NextEV, Future Mobility and Qiantu Motor are mostly backed by big internet groups such as Alibaba and Tencent, Shanghai-based WM Motor's funding, in the ""billions of yuan"", is from Chinese investors, but not technology tycoons or venture capital funds, says Shen. He declined to say who the money has come from.

Shen, 46, has two decades of experience in the United States and China, with BorgWarner, Fiat and Geely, which in 2010 bought Swedish car brand Volvo. He aims to make smart, connected electric battery cars, betting on ordinary drivers in China's big cities wanting more affordable EVs.

He plans to go straight for this mass market rather than follow Tesla in first building a high profile super all-electric battery sports car.

""Building a fancy car to impress people is actually fairly easy as long as you're willing to spend the money,"" Shen says. ""The most challenging part is mass production - coming up with a car everybody can buy, with high quality but at a significantly lower cost.""

""NUTS""

Shen reckons he has around a 5-year window of opportunity to establish WM Motor in China, while Beijing offers incentives and policy support for EVs.

""I don't think traditional car companies are doing well selling cars, especially with their customer experience. With smart, connected cars, I believe I can change that,"" says Shen, who has an engineering Masters from University of California at Los Angeles.

""We're not a traditional car company. We see ourselves as a service company,"" he says, while acknowledging that friends, family and former colleagues ""all think I'm nuts"" for starting a new auto brand from scratch.

Advocates, including Shen, see smart, connected EVs revolutionizing the car industry, with today's often-idle cars replaced by smart cars that can be leased out when not needed or shared as part of a city fleet, and which tell the owner when the oil needs changing or a service is due.

""What's important for these emerging EV companies ... is the potential change in customer experience, if they can transform the way the car fits into our lives,"" says James Chao, Asia-Pacific managing director at consultant IHS.

""Creation of an entire ecosystem enabled by fast mobile internet connectivity, location-based intelligence ... will be critical.""

ONLINE SALES

The emergence of China's EV start-ups does not yet signal any major related technology breakthroughs. Shen is actually turning to a German firm's tech team he acquired for battery, motor control and other technologies.

The innovation of WM Motor and others is more in creating new business models for personal transportation.

Shen was tight-lipped, but three individuals close to WM Motor said he wants to sell cars primarily online, with a limited number of showrooms. Customer test drives would likely be contracted out to a third party, and various car dealers with excess service capacity would carry out maintenance and repairs.

There's already competition.

While Coda, an electric car start-up run by ex-GM China chief Phil Murtaugh, failed three years ago, a Beijing start-up called Zhiche Auto aims to launch smart, connected electric cars by as early as the end of next year.

Shen Haiyin, the company's 42-year-old founder and CEO, says he, too, is targeting big-city drivers with more affordable EVs, with third-party engineering and a Japanese electric propulsion system, to be sold under the Jidian brand name.

Also, Tesla could start manufacturing sooner than expected in China, making its cars more competitive as they wouldn't face the import duties now levied on foreign-produced vehicles. Spokeswoman Khobi Brooklyn said Tesla doesn't comment on speculation.

CHINA FIRST

WM Motor plans to build an assembly plant, most likely in Zhejiang province, and launch three models, starting in 2018. It plans to nearly double its workforce to around 600 this year in China and Germany, where it is working on around two dozen prototype cars.

The first of those models is aimed at competing with the $35,000 Tesla Model 3, billed as a mass market EV. Shen says WM Motor aims to sell more than 100,000 cars a year within 3-4 years of the planned 2018 launch, at around that price, or cheaper. China is the priority market for now, but Shen says he is also looking to enter the U.S. market further down the line.

He reckons WM Motor has an edge over rivals by mating high-spec German technology with what he calls low-cost, high-quality parts from Chinese suppliers.

New insurance policy: Abandon ACA exchanges to avoid losses

Aetna became the latest health insurer to cast doubt upon its future in the Affordable Care Act's insurance exchanges after it called off a planned expansion Tuesday and suggested it could abandon that market completely.

A departure by Aetna, the nations' third-largest insurer, could further reduce the number of choices for customers and eventually push insurance prices higher.

Aetna said Thursday it has been swamped with higher than expected costs, particularly from pricey specialty drugs, and it will take a hard look at its current presence on exchanges in 15 states.

CVS Health tops 2Q profit forecasts, spurred by acquisitions

CVS Health beat second-quarter earnings expectations and nudged its 2016 forecast higher after the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager reaped gains from a couple of deals and its sales of pricey specialty drugs rose.

The company said revenue from established stores — a key metric for retailers — rose 2 percent during the second quarter

Overall, CVS Health's earnings plunged 27 percent to $924 million in the quarter that ended June 30. That was due mainly to a $542-million loss on the early retirement of some debt and $81 million in acquisition-related costs. Adjusted earnings came to $1.32 per share.

Australia cuts key interest rate to record-low 1.5 percent

SYDNEY (AP) — Australia's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 1.5 percent on Tuesday, in a bid to jolt the nation's sluggish economy amid low inflation rates.

The Reserve Bank of Australia cut the cash rate by a quarter percentage point from its previous low of 1.75 percent. The board last cut rates in May. Economists had largely predicted Tuesday's cut.

RBA Governor Glenn Stevens cited the nation's low inflation rate as a driver behind the cut. Annual inflation is just 1 percent, far below the bank's target of 2 to 3 percent.

Remember when Italian restaurants had white tablecloths, crystal chandeliers and tableside carts staffed by waiters who boned fish and flamed sauces? Katerina Ristorante Italiano, which opened in Great Neck a few months ago, offers these touches. It is a pleasant throwback to the 1980s.

Antonio Cerra, the general manager, can usually be found strolling around the dining room, suggesting to customers that they look at the menu as a starting point; the kitchen will make to order any dish the customer desires, if it has the ingredients. Free bruschetta, olives, thin slices of soppressata and chunks of Parmesan cheese are on offer. The bread basket, too, with its two varieties of bread (ciabatta and baguette) and accompanying herb butter and olive oil, is satisfying.

On a recent Saturday night, many patrons seemed to know one another. There was a lot of air kissing and hand waving. Yes, there were the expected diners in jeans and casual togs but an eye-popping number were dressed to the nines: men in suits and women with straight-from-the-salon hair.

Photo

Katerina is owned by Mr. Cerra’s daughter, Katerina Cerra, also known as Kathy. Mr. Cerra, an experienced restaurateur, is the previous owner of Il Gabbiano, Da Antonio and Padre Figlio, all in Manhattan. The chef, Alberto Argudo, has traveled with Mr. Cerra from restaurant to restaurant.

There is a special menu and a regular menu. Regular pastas and entrees carry a price tag mainly in the 20s and low 30s. Special entrees, however, include exotica like filet mignon of bison, rack of New Zealand venison, rib veal chop, Dover sole and Hawaiian white tuna, and can cost as much as $52.

The Katerina salad was a standout appertizer, and at $10 was also the least expensive option. The picture-perfect dish featured mesclun topped with generous slices of avocado and paper-thin fennel, all ringed with grape tomatoes and strips of roasted red peppers. Also noteworthy were the soups: a light pasta fagioli laced with escarole and tomatoes, and a hearty beef and barley with abundant chunks of filet mignon.

Earning praise, too, were the tender grilled octopus over greens and the carpaccio of smoked salmon: thin slices laid over peppery arugula with capers, caper berries, lemon and sliced red onions and tomatoes.

Photo

The sole appetizer disappointment was the stuffed baby eggplant, which was dry. I was the unlucky diner who had ordered it, and I also struck out with my main dish that night: the bucatini amatriciana. The pasta had the expected tomato sauce with onions and pancetta but there was too little of the sauce and the resulting dish was heavy and dry.

A much better pasta was the pappardelle Piemontese, with wild mushrooms, shaved truffle cheese and a lush, creamy truffle sauce. Other impressive entrees included a ravioli filled with ricotta and mushrooms; a wine-tinted risotto crowned with thin slices of very tender and rare bison and venison; a thick Berkshire pork chop covered with sautéed cherry peppers; and a veal scaloppine Martino, featuring three Parmesan-crusted cutlets, each topped with an asparagus spear and a baby artichoke, and served in a tangy lemon sauce.

Some desserts are made in house. Our favorite, though, was brought in from Carousel Cakes in Nanuet, Rockland County: It was a rich chocolate mousse concoction with alternating layers of mousse and cake. Two home-made sweets were pleasant — the crème brûlée was satiny and the tiramisù was creamy — though I would have liked the latter better with a dusting of cocoa rather than the intrusively crunchy chocolate chips on top.

That minor quibble was among the very few we had at Katerina Ristorante Italiano. The majority of the dishes sing and the atmosphere provides a refreshing break from the more sleek and trendy restaurants in the area.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2248,"The latest polling suggests the British are inclined to drop out of the European Union, throwing the future of the world’s largest trading bloc into doubt.

The United States in November may elect a president who promises to abandon many norms of governance, and a horrendous terrorist attack has opened up new talk in the presidential race of upending the nation’s longstanding economic and diplomatic relationships with the rest of the world.

Oh, and last month the United States experienced its weakest job growth in six years.

If there was a good time for financial markets to show signs of fear for global economic and political stability, this would seem to be it.

In the last several days there has been some evidence, if you look carefully enough, of the risk that some big, disruptive events will become priced into markets. The British pound has fallen steeply on currency markets, reflecting the risk of “Brexit,” and government bond prices in advanced nations have soared (and their yields have fallen) as investors have plowed money into safe assets.

But many other financial market conditions are more consistent with what you expect to see when everything is basically going fine — not indicative of a major risk of financial, economic or geopolitical upheaval.

The American stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, is hovering just below record highs. A measure of expected market volatility, the Vix, has spiked in the last few days but remains well below its level of just a few months ago. Oil prices have been rising steadily since February and haven’t moved much in the last week, let alone shown the drop you might expect if a collapse in global demand seemed imminent.

There are two possibilities of what is going on. At best, the markets are telling us something important that excitable journalists and pundits aren’t. Call this the markets-are-smart theory.

At worst, markets are complacent, and deep-seated flaws in how financial markets work mean that current stock and commodity prices aren’t reflecting the major risks that lie ahead.

The “markets are really efficient” story goes like this: Britain, when all is said and done, will probably vote to remain part of Europe (as betting markets suggest). Donald Trump probably won’t be elected president (as polling suggests). The American economy will probably keep doing O.K. despite the weak May jobs numbers.

Photo

And even if any of those forecasts turns out to be wrong, the consequences for the economy and corporate profits won’t be as severe as fearful headlines suggest. The British economy will remain basically sound as the nation renegotiates its trade relationships; Mr. Trump will govern more like a conventional president than his words now suggest; and any economic slump in the United States will be short and mild.

In this story, stock, bond and currency traders have the wisdom to look past the noise that the aforementioned excitable journalists and pundits don’t.

The other argument is scarier.

Markets are very good at incorporating news into asset prices when it’s clear and straightforward how one should affect the other. When a company releases an earnings report, analysts can quickly figure out what it should mean for the stock price, and the stock moves accordingly. When data comes out that makes a Federal Reserve rate increase 10 percent more likely, it’s fairly straightforward to translate that into the proper pricing of Treasury bonds and the dollar. A disruption to an oil pipeline has a relatively clear-cut impact on the price of crude.

So traders are efficient at pricing in pieces of news that affect asset prices in predictable ways over the short and medium term. They’re a lot worse at predicting which major threats to the global economy will spiral out of control and which will turn out to hardly matter.

In the summer and fall of 2011, investors were panicked that the eurozone would unravel because of the fiscal crisis that started in Greece. Global stock markets, commodities and risky forms of debt plummeted; volatility skyrocketed.

But things turned out to be more or less fine. More aggressive action by the European Central Bank and European political leaders starting late that year helped calm everyone. And while the European economy is not in great shape, the Continent experienced no epic financial crisis. If you had the nerve to buy eurozone stocks in September 2011, you have enjoyed a 51 percent return on your money.

Other times, instead of being too fearful of cataclysmic events, financial markets are too complacent. What we now call the global financial crisis got its start in mid-2007, as losses on mortgage-related securities mounted and global money markets froze up.

But after some initial efforts by the Federal Reserve and other government officials to contain the damage, financial markets rallied 11 percent from mid-August through mid-October, pushing the stock market to new highs and suggesting all was well. Of course, as it turned out, a severe recession and catastrophic financial crisis were just around the corner. People who bought into any risky assets, whether stocks or mortgage-backed securities, at the October highs lost their shirts.

Some smart people, like strategists at Goldman Sachs, are advancing the possibility that markets could be in a similarly precarious state right now. It may even be that the normal mechanisms through which those fears would translate into lower stock prices and higher volatility indexes are broken right now; many “macro” hedge funds that bet on big seismic changes in the global economy have been losing money for the last few years, and some have closed.

Even if that’s so, the next few months will be a great test of just how much markets really know about the future. And given the precarious headlines of the last few months, anyone who wants to make sure they don’t lose their shirts again should hope that they’ve got it right.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

A few years ago, Peter Thiel gave a lecture series at Stanford that was later collected, lightly edited and published as a book titled “Zero to One: Notes on Start-ups, or How to Build the Future.” Mark Zuckerberg, an early beneficiary of Thiel’s largess as a venture capitalist, contributed an endorsement. “This book,” his blurb on the flap reads, “delivers completely new and refreshing ideas on how to create value in the world.”

The volume does nothing of the sort, but as a self-help book, it’s not bad. Think of it as the equivalent of Sheryl Sandberg’s “Lean In” but for the resentful young man. And, though largely superfluous and forgettable, it is in some ways the most honest book a Silicon Valley entrepreneur has yet produced. It contains about a thick pamphlet’s worth of tough-love pointers about how the most successful people think long-range, form definite plans, pursue determinate goals. Its exhortations are no more fatuous, if perhaps less specific, than those of Dale Carnegie: “A start-up is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world.”

In Thiel’s account, “technology” is what we call an act of moving from zero to one, the creation of new value in a vacuum. “Globalization,” on the other hand, is simply the monocultural proliferation of what we already have. Real entrepreneurs, he writes, refuse to build an “undifferentiated commodity business” — that is, they refuse to compete in a market where they will have to compete on price. The reasoning he offers is that you can’t really make any profit that way, as margins will be competed down to zero and the only people who gain are the financiers who can consolidate and take advantage of economies of scale. But this is merely economic cover for his real point, which is that the businesses of clerks and shopkeepers just aren’t important.

Near the beginning of the book, he tells a weird story about lunch in 2001. It was the early days of PayPal, and he and his (almost exclusively foreign-born) colleagues would go out on Castro Street, the main drag of Silicon Valley’s Mountain View:

PayPal was at that time the only email-based payments company in the world. We employed fewer people than the restaurants on Castro Street did, but our business was much more valuable than all of those restaurants combined. Starting a new South Indian restaurant is a really hard way to make money. If you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating factors — maybe you think your naan is superior because of your great-grandmother’s recipe — your business is unlikely to survive.

On its face, Thiel’s example is preposterous. If you’re in the business of running an Indian restaurant, the superiority of your naan is not a trivial differentiating factor; it’s a signal one. But Thiel’s real attitude is that running an Indian restaurant, even a profitable one, simply isn’t worth doing. It’s mere “globalization,” the reproduction of what someone far away has decided is worthwhile.

Thiel’s underlying interest isn’t objective but objectivist; he’s interested less in value than he is in valor. He can’t imagine why any self-respecting person would want to go from one to two or two to three. He cannot sympathize with the cook who might stake his or her self-image on having Castro Street’s best naan. For him, there is only the Zarathustran heroism of clawing from null bis eins, of escaping the herdlike mentality of das Mann for the freedom of the Übermensch. Thiel, who can’t resist any chance to deride universities, does not want to see intelligence as itself a fixed cost — something in which an institution might invest — because he simply believes that a person is either creative and courageous and worthwhile or he is not.

After it was announced that Thiel would address the Republican National Convention, there was no end to the speculation about his motives. This speculation centered around not just his decision to speak but also the reason for his support of Donald Trump in the first place — and, even more generally, about what it might mean that one of Silicon Valley’s most exalted figures had thrown in his lot with the nominee. Attempted explanations ran from the specific (an opportunity to speak to Republicans as a gay man) to the expansive (Thiel seeks the end of democracy).

For all of the expectation, the speech was muted and, for people with any familiarity with Thiel’s beliefs, predictable. The oil shocks of the early 1970s, and the ineptitude of the political class to deal with that decade’s succession of economic crises, left America stagnant. Decades of public support for scientific research led to such triumphs as the Apollo space program; since then, he likes to say, “We wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters.” Beneath all of this has always been a kind of “war is the health of the state” mentality: It was only the climate of the Cold War that allowed for the efficient allocation of public resources to ambitious, organized, long-term projects.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2254,"A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that the Dallas pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity is entitled to terminate its $38 billion merger with the Williams Companies, culminating one of the most contentious cases of buyer’s remorse in recent memory.

The ruling is a victory for Energy Transfer, which for months has been seeking to kill the deal. As the energy markets plummeted late last year, the cash-and-stock transaction it had to talk Williams into doing became nearly untenable.

By March, with just months left to consummate the transaction, Energy Transfer and its outside counsel discovered a problem with the merger — that it may not ultimately be deemed tax-free, which was a condition for the deal to close.

Williams did not convince the Delaware court that this discovery was influenced by Energy Transfer’s desire to get out of the deal, according to the ruling.

“Just as motive alone cannot establish criminal guilt, however, motive to avoid a deal does not demonstrate lack of a contractual right to do so,” Sam Glasscock III, the vice chancellor of the Court of Chancery, wrote in his ruling on Friday.

In a statement on the ruling, Williams said, “While we appreciate the court’s consideration of this matter, Williams does not believe E.T.E. has a right to terminate the merger agreement because E.T.E. has breached the merger agreement by failing to cooperate and use necessary efforts to satisfy the conditions to closing.”

It added that it would “take appropriate actions” to enforce its rights under the merger agreement.

While Williams’s options have dwindled, all is not lost.

Williams has a special meeting on Monday, at which shareholders were expected to vote on the deal. Regardless of the outcome of that vote, Energy Transfer is expected to terminate the merger. After that, Williams will most likely choose to appeal the court’s decision, meaning it will go to the Delaware Supreme Court.

On Friday, Williams said it continued to recommend that shareholders vote for the merger.

Williams also said previously that it reserved the right to seek damages from Energy Transfer. It is unclear how much Williams might request.

Either way, this decision could leave significant “litigation overhang” on Energy Transfer, according to a note by analysts at Evercore ISI. Because of that, Energy Transfer may choose to settle with a one-time payment to Williams, the analysts wrote.

The pipeline companies’ path to court was a long, winding one. The deal became serious about a year ago, when Energy Transfer made an unsolicited, all-equity offer, and Williams rejected it. As an enticement, Energy Transfer threw in $6 billion worth of cash in another proposal — a decision that came back to haunt it.

Williams’s board was divided, with a majority of directors rejecting the newer offer after several rounds of votes. Ultimately, two directors swung the other way, and a $38 billion cash-and-stock transaction was announced on Sept. 28.

Shortly afterward, the planned combination descended into utter chaos. Shares of both companies were dragged down with the slump in commodity prices last fall. While pipeline companies transport oil and gas — rather than dig it out of the ground — their plight worsened as their customers teetered on bankruptcy.

By Christmas, Kelcy Warren, the chairman of Energy Transfer, was stewing. He fretted that the debt Energy Transfer would shoulder to pay for the $6 billion cash component of the deal would prompt the ratings agencies to downgrade his company to “junk status.”

But there was no easy way out. Energy Transfer slashed its estimates for the revenue bump it could get by combining with Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., and threatened to lay off thousands of Williams’s employees.

Friday’s decision, however, concerned two other actions. Energy Transfer created a special class of stock that gave certain insiders, including Mr. Warren, priority if the company’s distributions (or tax-free payouts to shareholders) were cut. Williams saw that as a breach of their agreement and sought the court’s help in unwinding the private offering.

Perhaps more concerning to Williams, though, was the decision by Energy Transfer’s outside counsel, Latham & Watkins, not to render a certain tax opinion that was a necessary condition to close the deal. Latham said that it could not give such an opinion (which was supposed to conclude with reasonable certainty that the transfer of assets into the partnership would be tax-free) because of the substantial decline in Energy Transfer’s stock price.

Williams sued again, seeking to prove that Latham was acting under the influence of its client to break up the deal, rather than engaging in its best efforts to close the transaction.

Energy Transfer countersued, arguing that it was, in fact, Williams that was trying to derail the deal.

All of these issues came together in the courtroom in Georgetown, Del., earlier this week. Energy Transfer and Latham witnesses focused on how they made an error in not spotting potential problems with the tax opinion when the deal was signed. Representatives of Williams pointed out how the issue with the tax opinion was something Energy Transfer discovered in March — conveniently at the same time that Mr. Warren wanted to get out of the deal.

The judge hinted at his likely decision on Tuesday, when he said that he did not care if Latham was right or wrong in refusing to issue its tax opinion. He just needed to know whether it was acting in “good faith.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2255,"The question here is what’s cheaper — and what’s wiser. To Mr. Trump, keeping American forces at home is part of the “America First” philosophy: They would be more focused on homeland defense and less likely to get involved in conflicts abroad that drain money, and power, from the American military. But at the Pentagon, most officers and political appointees view that as pre-World War II thinking and argue that forward-deployed troops are crucial to national security.

The “freedom of navigation” tours that American forces take through the South China Sea are supposed to be a reminder to the Chinese that there could be a price to expanding the area they argue is sovereign Chinese territory and reclaiming reefs to build military installations. It would be hard to do those from home. The United States launches drones — and keeps a store of 50 nuclear weapons — at the American base in Incirlik, Turkey. The naval base in Bahrain runs patrols to keep Iran from choking off oil routes. And troops based in South Korea, Japan, Germany and Africa train with local forces.

When a tsunami hit Indonesia and earthquakes struck China and Pakistan, American forces in the Pacific delivered emergency supplies. And it was Republicans who complained that when the Benghazi attack happened in 2012, American forces were too far from Libya to help.

As for cost, there is some question of which approach would save more money. Japan, for example, pays such a large percentage of the cost of housing troops that the Pentagon has long argued it would be more expensive to bring them home.

On Trade

Mr. Trump doesn’t like the North American Free Trade Agreement and never has. His approach to dealing with it, he said, would be to renegotiate it, or “I would pull out of Nafta in a split second.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Nafta is deeply unpopular, and in part, economists say, that is because jobs leave the country en masse. (Mr. Trump often refers to the Carrier air-conditioning plant that is shutting down and moving 1,400 jobs out of the country.) But when jobs are created in the United States, it is often hard to say whether that is because of a trade deal or just an improvement in business.

As a practical matter, no one knows what withdrawing from Nafta would mean — just as no one knows what “Brexit” means for Britain and the rest of Europe. Unwinding a huge trade agreement, and the rules that have governed tariffs, movement across borders and adjudication of disputes, would be enormously complicated. And doing so could be costly: United States businesses would lose easy access to the Mexican and Canadian markets, along with preferential treatment on investments there. But Mr. Trump insists he could negotiate a far better deal.

On Shaping Other Nations

Messing around inside another country’s borders? Not for Mr. Trump. He has a more traditional view of how American power should be exercised.

For decades, one of the unspoken traditions of American foreign policy was that intervention ended at another country’s borders — unless that country posed an imminent threat to the United States. Over the decades, the United States had lots of allies and partners who were strongmen — in the Philippines, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere — but didn’t interfere with their internal politics.

That changed over the past 20 or so years as the United States began to intervene, sometimes on humanitarian grounds. That was the basis of the Balkan conflict, and the American and European intervention in Libya in 2011. But Mr. Trump seems determined to turn that around: In his discussion of last week’s coup attempt in Turkey, he spoke admiringly of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the way he put down the military uprising, but Mr. Trump offered no warnings that Mr. Erdogan needed to obey the rule of law in what appeared to be a huge purge and a declaration of emergency powers.

In short, Mr. Trump wants to take American values out of its relationship with other nations and not seek to transform their actions. That would be a huge change in American foreign policy and could well signal to the world’s authoritarians that they had a free pass — to imprison dissidents, torture opponents and ignore human rights standards without fear that their relationship with the United States would suffer.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

The Justice Department is preparing lawsuits to block two giant health insurance deals, according to a person briefed on the matter, continuing a spate of antitrust actions in a whirlwind year for mergers and acquisitions.

Antitrust officials are concerned that Aetna’s $37 billion deal with Humana, and Anthem’s $48 billion pursuit of Cigna, will harm competition in the health insurance industry, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the suits had not yet been filed. The deals would have decreased the number of the largest insurers to three, from five.

The Justice Department’s final decision is expected this week or next, the person said.

Anthem and Cigna both declined to comment, and Humana did not immediately return a request for comment. A spokesman for Aetna said: “We don’t comment on rumors and speculation, but we are steadfast in our belief that this deal is good for consumers and the health care system as a whole.”

If both deals are withdrawn, 2015 would no longer be the largest year ever for mergers and acquisitions globally, according to Dealogic, a data provider. Instead, 2016 would be on pace to break records for the scope of withdrawn deals, with $723 billion of deals being abandoned so far this year.

Challenges to the health insurance deals would be the latest in a string of suits against what the government perceives to be anticompetitive mergers. Similar concerns caused the breakup of Baker Hughes’s proposed $35 billion combination with a fellow oil-field services company, Halliburton. Antitrust concerns also thwarted the $6.3 billion merger between Staples and Office Depot.

Bloomberg News reported on the expected lawsuits earlier on Tuesday. Shares of all four companies fell in afternoon trading.

If the lack of regulatory approval scuttles their deal, Anthem will need to pay a $1.85 billion breakup fee to Cigna, according to the merger agreement. Aetna will be required to give $1 billion to Humana under those same circumstances, according to a filing. The companies could challenge any Justice Department findings, and the mergers could proceed if the companies can successfully make the case that the deals do not harm competition.

The proposed mergers would greatly reshape the health insurance landscape. The combination of Anthem with Cigna would create a powerful presence in the market to offer insurance administration to large employers. And Aetna’s combination with Humana threatened to further consolidate the market for private Medicare plans.

Of the five largest insurers, only UnitedHealth Group, the most diversified of the national plans, remained out of last year’s merger frenzy.

While the two mergers were aimed at very different types of insurance markets, consumer advocates and others raised concerns that the deals would result in higher insurance prices for consumers. Even if the larger companies were able to drive down the prices they paid for care from hospitals and doctors, critics worried those savings would not flow to the people covered under the plans.

“Prices may go up either way,” said David Friend, managing director at BDO, the consulting firm. “But if they do not block, people can say you created this problem by allowing competition to disappear.”

The companies argued the mergers made sense in the new world created under the Affordable Care Act, in which their profits were limited and their business model shifted more to figuring out how to deliver care less expensively.

Investors have suspected for a while that the Anthem-Cigna deal was in trouble. In May, a series of letters reported on by The Wall Street Journal showed both sides fighting over issues such as Anthem’s lawsuit against Express Scripts over the price of drugs, and Cigna’s tendency to miss deadlines and submit paperwork in the wrong format to the Justice Department during its antitrust review process.

But analysts and others put better odds on Aetna and Humana completing the deal, given the ability of the companies to divest themselves of businesses in areas where the two had too much market share.

While both companies are expected to challenge the Justice Department’s decision, Aetna seems to be the most adamant about fighting the government’s attempt to block the deal.

In a note to investors, Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners, described Anthem’s chances of winning as “slim,” while she had more faith in Aetna’s ability to prevail. Aetna and Humana may be able to eventually present a deal that allays antitrust concerns.

“I’m imagining they have a pretty good shot,” she said.

Health care has become a whirlwind of merger activity in recent years as both hospitals and health plans seek to become bigger. Many hospitals have scrambled to combine and to join forces with physician groups, and insurers have bulked up in response, as a way to have greater clout in their negotiations. Many hospital deals are too small to capture regulators’ notice.

The insurance companies have also argued that the Affordable Care Act, which transformed much of their business, has created pressure to merge. In an interview after Aetna announced its proposed merger with Humana, Mark T. Bertolini, Aetna’s chairman and chief executive, argued that companies needed to be able to invest the capital and resources necessary to compete in a rapidly changing environment.

“People who did not invest enough in health care reform and a retail marketplace are going to struggle,” he said.



Many deal makers believe regulators have taken a tougher stance this year. The Obama administration revealed an executive order in April, for example, that encouraged government agencies and policy makers to block mergers that they saw as obstructing competition.

The administration has also been more forceful in thwarting deals conducted purely for tax purposes. In April, the Treasury Department’s new rules on inversions — where American companies acquire foreign ones to attain tax efficiencies — helped to kill Pfizer’s $152 billion merger with Allergan, a fellow drug maker.

The Justice Department’s decision on the health care mergers has a good chance of overlapping with either the Republican or Democratic National Convention, and may result in additional political attention. Some politicians have looked at thwarting so-called mega-mergers as a way to address economic issues such as income inequality and wage growth.

If both health insurance deals fall through, the total amount of transactions would drop to $4.59 trillion, according to Dealogic. That would no longer set a record, but it would still be the highest since 2007.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2264,"| Britain has voted to leave the European Union, stunning the world with a historic decision that will reshape its place in the world, rattle the Continent and rock political establishments throughout the West, Steven Erlanger reports in The New York Times.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who led the campaign to remain in the bloc, announced that he would step down by October, saying the country deserved a leader committed to carrying out the will of the people.

The margin of victory startled many, with 52 percent of people voting to leave and 48 percent voting to remain in the bloc.

The value of the pound plummeted to its lowest level since 1985, and stock markets were

roiled worldwide as they reeled from the uncertainty that the vote unleashed.

Investors fled volatility for haven assets, pushing up the Japanese yen.

The flight for safety has exacerbated troubles for the Japanese government, which wants a weaker currency to spur exports and economic growth. It may also tighten credit as investors choose to put their money only in safe places like United States Treasuries, making borrowing costs higher for heavily indebted nations, like Greece, Italy and Portugal. Emerging markets may find it more difficult to secure investment, hampering their economic growth.

Few expect that Britain’s departure from Europe will set off a full financial crisis like that seen after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, but no one knows enough to rule that out either, Peter S. Goodman writes in The New York Times.

Thomas Lam, the chief economist for industrialized countries at RHB Securities Singapore, said he expected global growth to suffer, while other countries would hold off doing business in Britain until the volatility subsided.

The euro followed the pound down, sinking to $1.1071 early in the European morning. Stock markets across Asia recoiled, as the Nikkei 225 plunged nearly 8 percent and shares of British banks plummeted on the Hong Kong stock markets.

European markets shuddered on opening, David Jolly reports in The New York Times. The FTSE 100 index in London fell 7.5 percent, led by shares in Barclays, which dropped 26 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark for eurozone blue-chips, fell 7.2 percent in early trading and the Dax in Germany opened down 8 percent. Yields on British and German government bonds slid, another indication of investors looking for the havens. The price of gold rose 6.6 percent.

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, pledged to support the financial system and the economy. He said the bank would “not hesitate to take any measures required to meet our responsibility.” The central bank had earmarked 250 billion pounds, or about $344 billion, to unleash as needed for stability. Markets took some solace, as they continued to pare back their losses for the day. Mr. Carney added that the central bank, the Treasury and banks had done enough contingency planning to be well prepared.

The vote is likely to prompt multinational banks to shift significant numbers of jobs from Britain to competing financial centers in the European Union, led by Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Amsterdam. Many experts assume Brussels will move quickly to restrict trading of euro-denominated assets — a major business for Britain. Prominent banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have already warned that a decision by Britain to withdraw from the European Union would push them to transfer some operations elsewhere.

The impact of the vote will last well beyond the immediate tumult in the financial markets. Once Britain begins the formal process of withdrawal, it has two years to negotiate the terms under which it will leave and unravel its ties with Europe.

Uncertainty now reigns, as the world reels in the face of this break-up.

PARIS — The art dealer and billionaire David Nahmad says he is well aware of the scornful whispers that trail him when he travels to Brazil, to New York. He says he feels the disapproving stares when he enters his synagogue at home in Monaco.

“People say, ‘Oh, David stole it; he should give it back immediately,’” Mr. Nahmad said in a rare interview at a hotel here.

“It” is a valuable painting by Modigliani, an oil portrait of a dapper chocolate merchant in a hat and tie, seated and holding a cane. A Nahmad holding company bought the work at auction in 1996 and has owned it ever since. But the grandson of a Jewish antiques dealer says it is the same work that was confiscated from his relative’s Paris shop during the Nazi occupation and sold off more than 70 years ago.

For almost five years, the grandson, Philippe Maestracci, and a company specializing in recovering looted art have pressed a claim in New York state and federal courts for the work, once estimated to be worth as much as $25 million.

Mr. Nahmad, the scion of a family of international art dealers, remains adamant that he will not settle. He is basing much of his stance on a French court record from 1947 that he says casts doubt on whether his painting is the same Modigliani that the antique dealer, Oscar Stettiner, tried to recover after World War II.

The court paper, filed in connection with Mr. Stettiner’s 1946 claim to regain the painting, describes it as a Modigliani self-portrait, not an image of a chocolate merchant.

But there is conflicting evidence cited by Mr. Maestracci, including the provenance listed when the Nahmad holding company unsuccessfully tried to sell the disputed painting, “Seated Man With a Cane,” through Sotheby’s in 2008.

In its sale materials, the auction house listed “Stettiner” as a possible previous owner of the painting and said it had then been sold anonymously in Paris between 1940 and 1945.

“I think the evidence is overwhelming,” James Palmer, whose Mondex Company is trying to reclaim the Modigliani painting for Mr. Maestracci, said in an interview from Italy.

In recent months, much of the conversation over the work has focused not on the particulars of its provenance but on whether Mr. Nahmad went to great lengths to conceal his ownership. Technically, the painting is owned by the International Art Center, a holding company that controls many masterpieces, from Monets to Picassos, and has long been known as a Nahmad company by art world insiders.

“The International Art Center is me personally,” said Mr. Nahmad, who said he uses it for security purposes to mask his name. “It’s David Nahmad.”

Nonetheless, for years, Mr. Nahmad’s representatives avoided making that direct connection in interviews. Much of the court battle over the Modigliani has revolved around whether the Art Center company is controlled by the Nahmads.

But the recent leak of a trove from the so-called Panama Papers — showing documents from the Mossack Fonseca law firm, which set up the holding company — made clear that Mr. Nahmad was indeed its principal. The resulting publicity was ugly and overwhelming, Mr. Nahmad said.

“Looted art, hidden art — they made me look like a crook instead of doing real battle in the court,” he said.

In April a Swiss prosecutor, reacting to the disclosure, placed a legal hold on the work, which is in storage in Geneva, while he investigated whether the painting was stolen property. (Last month, he dropped the seizure order, citing insufficient evidence.)

Wasn’t it a mistake not to have been more transparent?

Mr. Nahmad turned to his Swiss lawyer, Rodolphe Gautier, who said that when you are “filing a lawsuit in New York you have to go against a proper defendant.”

“No matter who is behind” the International Art Center, he added, “it really does not change the lawsuit.”

Mr. Nahmad, 69, has long loathed publicity, but he has changed his strategy. He hired a public relations firm and last week set up shop at a suite in the five-star Plaza Athénée hotel here where he met individually with several reporters.

A glass coffee table was piled high with Modigliani catalogs that Mr. Nahmad, in a casual blue sweater and slacks, thumbed through. They showed that he had lent the disputed painting to several museums, including the Jewish Museum in New York in 2004.

“If you had any doubt about looted art, would you really lend it to a Jewish museum?” he asked.

Mr. Palmer, of Mondex, says a series of documents demonstrate the Stettiner ownership of the work, including the catalog for the 1930 Venice Biennale where a “portrait of a man” by Modigliani was exhibited and credited to the collection of a Mr. Stettiner. The listing for a July 1944 sale by the French auction house Drouot, which sold items taken from Mr. Stettiner, records the sale of an unnamed Modigliani picture.

The price was 16,000 francs, though, far too low, Mr. Nahmad says, for a large work in oil by Modigliani, even then. Today that price would be equal to almost 3,000 euros, or about $3,375.

Mr. Nahmad said he feels his position has been strengthened by an obscure 1947 French court document located by his researcher in the Paris archives amid the files of the claim submitted by Mr. Stettiner. The document had been legally sealed until 2022, but Mr. Nahmad successfully applied for an exemption to examine it.

The document is from a French bailiff who presided over Mr. Stettiner’s restitution case. In it, the bailiff refers to the painting as “a picture representing the painter Modigliani painted by himself.”

But Mr. Palmer, who has seen the document, said he is not persuaded. “The bailiff is not an art expert,” he said. “It’s pretty easy for a bailiff to make that kind of mistake.”

With that impasse, Mr. Nahmad said he is poised to fight on in the courts.

In the meantime, he is weighing invitations to exhibit his painting. He said he thinks the best option is to loan it to a museum in Israel. For now, he said, he has too many doubts to relinquish the painting.

But he said, “If it’s proven that this painting is looted by the Nazis, I will give it back.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2268,"The process of withdrawal is likely to play out slowly, perhaps taking years. It will mean pulling out of the world’s largest trading zone, with 508 million residents, including the 65 million people of Britain, and abandoning a commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. It has profound implications for Britain’s legal system, which incorporates a large body of regulations that cover everything from product safety to digital privacy, and for Britain’s economy.

The main ways in which the change will be felt are on trade — Britain will lose automatic access to the European single market — and on immigration, with Britain no longer bound to allow any European Union citizen to live and work in the country. Britain will have to try to negotiate new deals covering those issues.

To those in Britain who supported remaining in Europe, the result of Thursday’s in-or-out referendum was a painful rejection, leaving the country exposed to a possible economic downturn and signaling a step away from the multiculturalism that they say has made Britain among Europe’s most vibrant societies.

The Votes for Each Side

To backers of leaving, the outcome was vindication of their belief that Britain could pursue an independent course in the world, free of the Brussels bureaucracy and able to control the flow of immigrants into the country.

“Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, one of the primary forces behind the push for a referendum on leaving the European Union, told cheering supporters just after 4 a.m.

For Mr. Cameron, the results were a humiliating disaster, forcing him to announce his departure only 13 months after he won re-election behind a surprisingly large Conservative majority in national elections. Critics said that he had led Britain out of Europe for no good reason and that the unity of the United Kingdom itself was threatened, with Scotland now more likely to try again to bolt.

Speaking in front of 10 Downing Street early Friday, with his wife, Samantha, standing nearby, Mr. Cameron said he would resign once a new leader had been chosen by his party, a decision he expected by October. He will stay now to provide stability, but a new prime minister, he said, should formally begin Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union and negotiate the terms of that divorce.

“I held nothing back,” Mr. Cameron said. His voice breaking, he said, “I love this country and I feel honored to have served it.”

His statement created an immediate churn in the political waters, with speculation that the two Conservatives most likely to succeed him are Boris Johnson, the flamboyant former mayor of London who helped lead the Leave campaign, and Theresa May, the Home secretary, who supported Mr. Cameron and Remain, but concentrated on doing her job rather than campaigning.

Mr. Johnson was booed Friday morning as he left his home in London, which voted overwhelmingly for Remain. In a brief statement later, Mr. Johnson praised Mr. Cameron, an old friend and rival from school days, as “an extraordinary politician” and said he was sad to see him go.

Mr. Johnson refused to answer questions about his own future but praised the result. “We can find our voice in the world again, a voice that is commensurate with the fifth-biggest economy on earth,” he said.

But if Britain’s Treasury and Central Bank are to be believed, the economic hit the country will take from leaving the single market of the European Union will be considerable, with permanent loss of economic growth, higher unemployment and lower tax receipts.

The immediate market reaction was an effort to find a floor in the midst of so much uncertainty, said Barrington Pitt Miller, an equity research analyst at Janus Capital. But he said he expected British economic growth to be zero or negative in the short and medium term, with a secondary impact over time as London’s financial services sector, which makes up about 10 percent of the economy, begins to move staff members and headquarters to Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin.

A lot will depend on how the European Union chooses in the end to respond — whether it is “vindictive, friendly or frightened,” he said.

Mr. Johnson and some in the Leave campaign argued that the other European nations valued trade with Britain so much that they would negotiate a special deal after Britain’s withdrawal to let Britain remain in the single market without having to guarantee freedom of movement and labor. That seems highly unlikely because it would only encourage other nations to pressure Brussels. But it may be that as the dust settles, some sort of association agreement with Britain could be negotiated, as Ms. Merkel suggested on Friday, though the price could be high.

The economy aside, the United Kingdom itself now faces a threat to its survival. Scotland voted by 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the European Union, and the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Friday that it was “democratically unacceptable” for Scotland to be dragged out of it against its will. Another independence referendum, she said, “is now highly likely.”

Appearing before reporters in front of the flags of Scotland and the European Union, Ms. Sturgeon, who leads the dominant Scottish National Party, said, “It is a statement of the obvious that the option of a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.”

The threat is real, but any new vote will not come soon, because it is only two years since the last one, which the Scottish nationalists lost, and the price of oil, on which the Scottish economy largely depends, has dropped.

Northern Ireland, too, voted for Remain, although Protestants and Roman Catholics, as usual, were split. But the prospect of an open border with Ireland now becoming a hard border between the European Union and the United Kingdom will change matters and require checks of passports and goods, putting strain on the Good Friday peace agreement.

In England, which voted for Leave, there are obvious strains, too.

They can be found between the young who voted in large numbers for Remain and those over 45, who voted for Leave; between the cities and the countryside; between richer and poorer; and between better educated and less educated.

London itself, the glittering, expensive, multicultural and multinational global capital, with its many immigrants and liberal values, was isolated in a sea of those favoring Leave; in some sense, the vote was against the wealthy elites who live in London and rule everyone else from there.

Last, there is the chasm between political leaders, nearly all of whom backed Remain, and many of their voters, who rebuffed them.

Bronwen Maddox, former editor of Prospect Magazine and the new director of the Institute for Government, a research institution, said in an email that “there is a growing intolerance for representative government, which is likely to have consequences for the ability of any government to run the country.”

The referendum, she suggested, might have been about Brussels, but it revealed and unleashed many other forces. Those forces, she said, “have ejected the U.K. from the European Union; they may now wreak similar turmoil on the old political parties themselves.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

The financial media tend to report breathlessly about what the stock market did yesterday. But savvy economic analysts have always known the bond market is the place to look for a real sense of where the economy is going, or at least where the smart money thinks it is going.

And right now, if the bond market is correctly predicting the economic path ahead, we should all be terrified.

But, please, read on before panicking. There’s a lot more to the story.

The stock market can rise and fall for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes for no apparent reason at all. But the bond market, where trillions of dollars change hands and long-term interest rates are determined, is steadier (normally). Its prices are generally tied closely to the outlook for growth and inflation over the years ahead.

The long-term interest rates that currently prevail across all the major advanced economies are consistent with a disastrous economic future. Taken at face value, they imply that the smart money expects inflation will remain extraordinarily low for years to come, and that growth will stay so weak that central banks won’t be able to raise rates for years. It is a shift that has accelerated since Britain’s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union, but one that has been underway for years.

Look at the current shape of the American “yield curve,” the chart of how rates compare for short, medium and long-term bonds. It implies a 60 percent chance of a recession in the next year based on historical patterns, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. Long-term interest rates hit record lows last week — which is to say the lowest in the 227-year history of rates in the United States.

Prices for inflation-protected bonds suggest that consumer prices will rise only about 1.4 percent a year through 2021 — and only 1.5 percent in the five years after that. They suggest that not only is the Federal Reserve unlikely to find conditions that warrant an interest rate increase in the remainder of 2016, but also that there is only about a 50 percent chance of a rate increase in 2017.

Across other major advanced economies, the signals sent by bond prices are even worse. Ten-year bonds are now offering negative interest rates in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Denmark and, as of Friday’s close, the Netherlands. That means buyers of these securities will get fewer euros, yen, Swiss francs or Danish kroner back than they invested, a development without precedent in hundreds of years of financial history.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2271,"Presidents do influence those factors, of course. Starting a war in the Middle East will affect oil prices. Government can help foster new industries and technologies — say, the internet — that can alter productivity. But there are other big items under presidential purview that the studies found that don’t have any impact, such as the size of the federal deficit or spending on the military.

A closer look at history reveals these patterns. President Dwight D. Eisenhower is known for his investment in the nation’s highway system, but the economy he oversaw benefited more from lessons in productivity that companies learned during the war, and the adoption of new technologies. President Ronald Reagan is lionized for his tax cuts and deregulation, but it was the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation that had the biggest impact. President Bill Clinton oversaw robust economic growth, but we have the rise of the internet and other factors outside of his control to thank.

There are also clearly presidential policy pushes that have more marginal, but important, consequences. Tax policy can either exacerbate or reduce income inequality, for example, which has been found to slow economic growth. Presidential appointments to agencies like the Federal Reserve and Department of Labor are crucial. Without the stimulus package pushed and signed by President Obama, the economy would almost certainly have fallen further into recession and taken far longer to crawl back out.

This also means that the person who is sworn into office in January will have at least some consequence for the economy. If it’s Mr. Trump, he’s made it clear that his top priorities will be trade and immigration policy. The details of his plans often shift, and depending on what course of action he takes on trade he could either help the economy by going after China’s currency manipulation or end up costing the country millions of jobs by starting a trade war. Reducing the flow of immigrants would certainly be terrible for the economy.

If Mrs. Clinton becomes president, it seems likely that first on her agenda will be pushing for national paid family leave, a minimum-wage increase and more government spending on things like infrastructure projects to create jobs. Paid family leave can keep people in the work force and even expand it. A bump in the minimum wage can put more money in people’s pockets and stimulate the economy — without, most likely, costing jobs. Infrastructure spending has been found to generate significant economic growth.

But both candidates need Congress to get these things done. The number of new laws enacted by recent Congresses has been steadily on the decline for some time. To get at least something accomplished, President Obama has been turning to his executive power. But the change that can be wrought through those orders is much smaller; rather than being able to raise the minimum wage on his own, for instance, he can do so only for government contractors. And those orders can always be reversed.

Even the stimulus, one of the most important economic accomplishments of the Obama administration, was hampered by concerns about what Congress would accept. There’s good reason to think that if the package had been larger, growth and jobs would have rebounded faster and we’d be in a better position today. But the administration knew there wouldn’t be political appetite for a larger number, so it was shorn down.

Whatever influence the president may have at times wielded over the economy is diminishing. With a gridlocked Congress, presidents are less and less able to push through enormous legislative changes that would substantially shift the course of the economy.

The perception that the president deserves either credit or blame for whatever the economy is doing is still strong. And therefore it matters for both candidates that they will almost certainly take the helm of a much stronger economy than the one Mr. Obama inherited. There are reasons for Americans to feel that the economy has a long way to go toward full recovery, such as stagnant wage growth, but it’s hard to deny the strength of an unemployment rate below 5 percent.

So although he or she won’t deserve it, the occupant of the White House will get some credit for strong economic performance at the outset. What happens after that will be mostly out of the president’s hands.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2272,"The economic collapse of recent years has left it unable to produce enough food on its own or import what it needs from abroad. Cities have been militarized under an emergency decree from President Nicolás Maduro, the man Mr. Chávez picked to carry on with his revolution before he died three years ago.

“If there is no food, there will be more riots,” said Raibelis Henriquez, 19, who waited all day for bread in Cumaná, where at least 22 businesses were attacked in a single day last week.

But while the riots and clashes punctuate the country with alarm, it is the hunger that remains the constant source of unease.

A staggering 87 percent of Venezuelans say they do not have money to buy enough food, the most recent assessment of living standards by Simón Bolívar University found.

About 72 percent of monthly wages are being spent just to buy food, according to the Center for Documentation and Social Analysis, a research group associated with the Venezuelan Teachers Federation.

In April, it found that a family would need the equivalent of 16 minimum-wage salaries to properly feed itself.

Ask people in this city when they last ate a meal, and many will respond that it was not today.

Among them are Leidy Cordova, 37, and her five children — Abran, Deliannys, Eliannys, Milianny and Javier Luis — ages 1 to 11. On Thursday evening, the entire family had not eaten since lunchtime the day before, when Ms. Cordova made a soup by boiling chicken skin and fat that she had found for a cheap price at the butcher.

“My kids tell me they’re hungry,” Ms. Cordova said as her family looked on. “And all I can say to them is to grin and bear it.”

Other families have to choose who eats. Lucila Fonseca, 69, has lymphatic cancer, and her 45-year-old daughter, Vanessa Furtado, has a brain tumor. Despite also being ill, Ms. Furtado gives up the little food she has on many days so her mother does not skip meals.

“I used to be very fat, but no longer,” the daughter said. “We are dying as we live.”

Her mother added, “We are now living on Maduro’s diet: no food, no nothing.”

Economists say years of economic mismanagement — worsened by low prices for oil, the nation’s main source of revenue — have shattered the food supply.

Sugar fields in the country’s agricultural center lie fallow for lack of fertilizers. Unused machinery rots in shuttered state-owned factories. Staples like corn and rice, once exported, now must be imported and arrive in amounts that do not meet the need.

In response, Mr. Maduro has tightened his grip over the food supply. Using emergency decrees he signed this year, the president put most food distribution in the hands of a group of citizen brigades loyal to leftists, a measure critics say is reminiscent of food rationing in Cuba.

“They’re saying, in other words, you get food if you’re my friend, if you’re my sympathizer,” said Roberto Briceño-León, the director of the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, a human rights group.

It was all a new reality for Gabriel Márquez, 24, who grew up in the boom years when Venezuela was rich and empty shelves were unimaginable. He stood in front of the destroyed supermarket where the mob had arrived at Cumaná, an endless expanse of smashed bottles, boxes and scattered shelves. A few people, including a policeman, were searching the wreckage for leftovers to take.

“During Carnival, we used to throw eggs at each other just to have some fun,” he said. “Now an egg is like gold.”

Down the coastal road in a small fishing town called Boca de Uchire, hundreds gathered on a bridge this month to protest because the food deliveries were not arriving. Residents demanded to meet the mayor, but when he did not come they sacked a Chinese bodega.

Residents hacked open the door with pickaxes and pillaged the shop, venting their anger at a global power that has lent billions of dollars to prop up Venezuela in recent years.

“The Chinese won’t sell to us,” said a taxi driver who watched the crowd haul away all that was inside. “So we burn their stores instead.”

Mr. Maduro, who is fighting a push for a referendum to recall him this year over the country’s declines, said it was the political opposition that was behind the attacks on the stores.

“They paid a group of criminals, brought them in trucks,” he said on Saturday on television, promising compensation to those who lost property.

At the same time, the government also blames an “economic war” for the shortages. It accuses wealthy business owners of hoarding food and charging exorbitant prices, creating artificial shortages to profit from the country’s misery.

It has left shop owners feeling under siege, particularly those who do not have Spanish names.

“Look how we are working today,” said Maria Basmagi, whose family immigrated from Syria a generation ago, pointing to the metal grate pulled over the window of her shoe store.

Her shop was on the commercial boulevard in Barcelona, another coastal town racked by unrest last week. At 11 a.m. the day before, someone screamed that there was an attack on a government-run kitchen nearby. Every shop on Ms. Basmagi’s street closed down in fear.

Other shops stay open, like the bakery in Cumaná where a line of 100 people snaked around a corner. Each person was allowed to buy about a pound of bread.

Robert Astudillo, a 23-year-old father of two, was not sure there would be any left once his turn came. He said he still had corn flour to make arepas, a Venezuelan staple, for his children. They had not eaten meat in months.

“We make the arepas small,” he said.

In the refrigerator of Araselis Rodriguez and Nestor Daniel Reina, the parents of four small children, there was not even corn flour — just a few limes and some bottles of water.

The family had eaten bread for breakfast and soup for lunch made from fish that Mr. Reina had managed to catch. The family had nothing for dinner.

It has not always been clear what provokes the riots. Is it hunger alone? Or is it some larger anger that has built up in a country that has crumbled?

Inés Rodríguez was not sure. She remembered calling out to the crowd of people who had come to sack her restaurant on Tuesday night, offering them all the chicken and rice the restaurant had if they would only leave the furniture and cash register behind. They balked at the offer and simply pushed her aside, Ms. Rodríguez said.

“It is the meeting of hunger and crime now,” she said.

As she spoke, three trucks with armed patrols drove by, each emblazoned with photos of Mr. Chávez and Mr. Maduro.

The trucks were carrying food.

“Finally they come here,” Ms. Rodríguez said. “And look what it took to get them. It took this riot to get us something to eat.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

MOST Westerners facing criminal charges in Cambodia would be thanking their lucky stars at finding themselves safe in another country. But Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, who is half British and half Spanish, is pleading with the Phnom Penh government to allow him back to stand trial along with three Cambodian colleagues. They’ve been charged, essentially, with interfering with the harvesting of one of the 21st century’s most valuable resources: sand.

Believe it or not, we use more of this natural resource than any other except water and air. Sand is the thing modern cities are made of. Pretty much every apartment block, office tower and shopping mall from Beijing to Lagos, Nigeria, is made at least partly with concrete, which is basically just sand and gravel stuck together with cement. Every yard of asphalt road that connects all those buildings is also made with sand. So is every window in every one of those buildings.

Sand is the essential ingredient that makes modern life possible. And we are starting to run out.

That’s mainly because the number and size of cities is exploding, especially in the developing world. Every year there are more people on the planet, and every year more of them move to cities. Since 1950, the world’s urban population has ballooned to over 3.9 billion from 746 million.

According to the United Nations Environment Program, in 2012 alone the world used enough concrete to build a wall 89 feet high and 89 feet wide around the Equator. From 2011 to 2013, China used more cement than the United States used in the entire 20th century.

To build those cities, people are pulling untold amounts of sand out of the ground. Usable sand is a finite resource. Desert sand, shaped more by wind than by water, generally doesn’t work for construction. To get the sand we need, we are stripping riverbeds, floodplains and beaches.

Extracting the stuff is an estimated $70 billion industry. It runs the gamut from multinational companies’ deploying enormous dredges to villagers toting shovels and buckets. In places where onshore sources have been exhausted, sand miners are turning to the seas.

This often inflicts terrible costs on the environment. In India, river sand mining is disrupting ecosystems, killing countless fish and birds. In Indonesia, some two dozen small islands are believed to have disappeared since 2005 because of sand mining. In Vietnam, miners have torn up hundreds of acres of forest to get at the sandy soil underneath.

Sand miners have damaged coral reefs in Kenya and undermined bridges in Liberia and Nigeria. Environmentalists tie sand dredging in San Francisco Bay to the erosion of nearby beaches.

Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

People are getting hurt, too. Sand mining has been blamed for accidental deaths in Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Gambia. In India and Indonesia, activists and government officials confronting black-market sand mining gangs have been killed.

Stronger regulations can prevent a lot of this damage, and do in most developed countries. But there’s a downside. Sand is tremendously heavy, which makes it expensive to transport. If you forbid sand mining in your backyard — as many American communities are trying to do — then it has to be trucked in from somewhere else. That drives up the price. Concrete is relatively cheap; if the cost of making a new building or road were to double, it could hit the economy hard.

Not to mention the extra truck traffic and pollution. California state officials estimated that if the average hauling distance for sand and gravel increased to 50 miles from 25 miles, trucks would burn through nearly 50 million more gallons of diesel fuel every year.

We can make more sand, but crushing rock or pulverizing concrete is costly, and the resulting sand is ill suited for many applications. We can use alternative substances for some purposes, but what other substance can we possibly find 40 billion tons of, every year?

The fishing villages in the mangrove-rich estuaries of Cambodia’s Koh Kong province might be the canaries in the global sand mine. For years, villagers have complained that rampant sand mining is wiping out the crabs and fish that provide their living. Locals told me on a recent visit that families have had to send members to work in Phnom Penh garment factories, or have simply moved away. The dredging also threatens endangered native dolphins, turtles and otters.

Last year, members of Mother Nature, an environmental group led by Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson and others, began a campaign to rein in the mining, organizing villagers to blockade and board the dredging ships. The government, which had expelled Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson a few months earlier for blocking road access to government officials trying to reach a hydropower dam in the province, arrested three of the activists, charging them with threatening to damage dredging boats, an offense that could mean two years in prison (Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson was charged in absentia as their accomplice a few months later).

Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson, who lives in Barcelona, is petitioning to be allowed back to attend his own trial. Meanwhile, the three jailed Cambodians have been denied bail for the past 10 months. Their trial has finally been scheduled for the end of June.

There’s an urgent question of justice for them. For the rest of us, there’s a profound lesson. Hardly anyone thinks about sand, where it comes from or what we do to get it. But a world of seven billion people, more and more of whom want apartments to live in and offices to work in and malls to shop in, can’t afford that luxury anymore.

It once seemed as if the planet had such boundless supplies of oil, water, trees and land that we didn’t need to worry about them. But of course, we’re learning the hard way that none of those things are infinite, and the price we’ve paid so far for using them is going up fast. We’re having to conserve, reuse, find alternatives for and generally get smarter about how we use those natural resources. That’s how we need to start thinking about sand.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2275,"Banks and other financial companies led a modest decline in U.S. stocks Friday after a report indicating that hiring had slowed sharply in May put investors in a selling mood.

The market slide ended a modest two-day winning streak and sent bond prices surging as investors sought safety in U.S. government-backed debt. The dollar fell sharply against several major currencies.

The downbeat jobs data appeared to convince traders that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low longer than previously expected. It also stirred concerns that the economy was slowing.

“What we don’t want to see is this number as a beginning of a series of weaker data,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That’s going to affect the market.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 6.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,099.13. The Nasdaq composite index gave up 28.85 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,942.52.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,807.06.

The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, the lowest amount in five years. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent from 5 percent.

Other reports out Friday also showed a mixed snapshot of the economy. The Institute of Supply Management said U.S. services firms grew in May at the slowest pace in more than two years, while the Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories rose in April by the largest amount in six months.

Speculation that the Fed will hold off on raising its key interest rate weighed on banks and financial services companies, as low interest rates make it harder for banks to make money from loans.

ETrade Financial slumped $1.44, or 5.1 percent, to $26.69, while Charles Schwab lost $1.62, or 5.3 percent, to $29.22. Bank of America fell 52 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $14.42. Citigroup slid $1.58, or 3.4 percent, to $45.39.

All told, financials sector companies posted the biggest drop in the in the S.&P. 500, sliding 1.4 percent. It’s down 1.7 percent this year and is the only one of the 10 sectors in the index that’s negative for 2016.

The prospect of interest rates holding steady made U.S. bonds more attractive, sending their prices sharply higher. That demand spike, in turn, pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down 1.70 percent from 1.80 late Thursday.

The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 17,850 Previous close 17,858.56 17,800 17,750 17,700 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m.

“What you’re seeing today is bonds are rallying because the thought that we’re going to see higher rates in the short term has come off the table a bit,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It’s about pure yield.”

The dollar also fell against other major currencies, falling to 106.68 yen from 108.91 the day before. The euro jumped to $1.1347 from $1.1148.

Traders also piled money into precious and industrial metals. Gold rose $30.30, or 2.5 percent, to $1,242.90 an ounce, while silver gained 34 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $16.37 an ounce. Copper added 4 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.11 a pound.

The rally in metals helped polish shares in some mining companies. Newmont Mining jumped $3.05, or 9.4 percent, to $35.40, while Freeport-McMoRan added 45 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $11.11.

Utilities companies, which had been down of late as investors bet on the Fed raising rates sooner, rather than later, surged Friday. The sector was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500, climbing 1.7 percent. It’s now up 15 percent this year.

Investors also bid up shares in several companies reporting earnings or sales data. Broadcom climbed 4.9 percent after the communications chip maker posted a bigger-than-expected profit in its fiscal second quarter. The stock climbed $7.65 to $162.56.

Ambarella jumped 9.4 percent after the video compression chip maker’s profit and revenue topped Wall Street’s expectations. The stock rose $3.99 to $46.47.

Gap rose 4.1 percent after the clothing chain operator reported late Wednesday that sales at established stores declined 6 percent in May, better than the 7 percent drop forecast by financial analysts. The stock added 76 cents to $19.09.

Traders were not as welcoming to Zumiez. The clothing retailer fell 4.2 percent after sales at older stores slumped in its fiscal first quarter. The stock shed 64 cents to $14.42.

Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 55 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $48.62 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slid 40 cents, or 0.8 percent, to close at $49.64 a barrel in London.

In other energy futures trading, natural gas dropped 1 cent to close at $2.398 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline slid 3 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil shed 2 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $1.49 a gallon.

In Europe, major stock indexes mostly fell. Germany’s DAX fell 1 percent, while France’s CAC 40 lost 1 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent.

Earlier in Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.5 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi inched up 0.04 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.4 percent.

2276,"Morning Agenda: Half of Williams Board Resigns

HALF OF WILLIAMS BOARD RESIGNS About half the directors at the Williams Companies resigned over disagreements about the future of the pipeline operator, Leslie Picker reports in DealBook.

A board vote over whether to oust the chief executive, Alan Armstrong, came out 6 to 6, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. Those who voted against Mr. Armstrong’s remaining on the board resigned.

The moves came after the $38 billion merger with Energy Transfer Equity was dismantled this week over a tax issue. According to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the resignations, those who resigned felt that Mr. Armstrong was ill-suited to lead Williams on its new course without Energy Transfer.

The board members who stepped down included the activists on the board: Keith Meister of Corvex Management and Eric Mandelblatt of Soroban Capital Partners. Frank MacInnis, the independent director chairman of Williams, also stepped down, but largely because of personal reasons, these people said. They were joined by Steven Nance, president of Steele Creek Energy, Laura Sugg, a former senior executive at ConocoPhillips, and Ralph Izzo, the chairman of Public Service Enterprise Group.

Williams is also appealing the termination of the deal with Energy Transfer Equity. Its only real chance is to argue some legal error, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in Deal Professor. But it comes down to whether the Delaware Supreme Court wants to intervene and agrees that “reasonable efforts” as a standard required more in this case.

These questions are valid, but it will be an uphill battle for Williams given the fact-finding of the lower court judge and the penchant of the state’s Supreme Court to defer to the lower court on these matters.

HERSHEY REJECTS MONDELEZ TAKEOVER OFFER Hershey, which has rebuffed numerous offers to buy it over the years, is facing one of its biggest challenges yet from a fellow chocolate giant, Michael J. de la Merced and Stephanie Strom report in DealBook.

Mondelez International, which makes Oreo cookies and Cadbury Chocolate, made a $23 billion offer, but Hershey is betting that it can remain independent or at least fetch a substantially higher price. It rejected the offer, saying that it “provided no basis for further discussion.”

Hershey’s impregnable defense has historically come from the charitable trust that controls about 81 percent of voting power, as Leslie Picker, Ms. Strom and Mr. de la Merced explain in DealBook. But many observers are asking whether this time its response will be different if Mondelez comes back with a higher offer.

The trust has already retained advisers separate from the Hershey Company itself as it weighs its own options. The Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office, which has raised concerns over the trust’s deployment of funds, is seeking an overhaul of its board. If that were to happen, some believe Hershey’s largest shareholder would be more apt to sell.

Mondelez has been mindful of the need to win over the trust – in its letter last week, it promised to maintain jobs and relocate the combined company’s chocolate operations to Hershey, Pa.

The Mondelez offer has also raised questions about whether Hershey could attract other buyers or whether Mondelez itself may be put into play.

Putting the two together would create a powerful force in the business of sweets. Mondelez is the world’s second-largest confectionery company – but it has very little business in the United States. Hershey has more than four-fifths of its sales in North America.

ON THE AGENDA Loretta Mester, the president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve, will speak at the European Economics and Financial Center at 11 a.m. The latest Manufacturing ISM Report on Business will be published at 10 a.m.

PUERTO RICO DEBT RELIEF STIRS COLONIAL RESENTMENT Puerto Ricans protested against the “junta,” a federal control board that will soon direct the island’s failing governance and finances, even as President Obama signed the debt relief law, Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook. “Junta” in Spanish just means board, although it has dictatorial connotations in English. Protesters converged after hearing that the debt relief law had passed the Senate.

Even Gov. Alejandro García Padilla seemed to join in, declaring a moratorium on paying the island’s debts just a day before a big payment was due, even though the new law precludes him from making such a move.

Beneath the rhetoric, however, there was resignation and an awareness that Puerto Rico’s own elected officials had let the island slip into a death spiral.

The need to pay the island’s $72 billion debt has crowded out other governmental spending in Puerto Rico, leaving schools closed, fewer hospital beds, and homeless people squatting in abandoned houses. Officials also scared off tourists fearful of the Zika virus by warning that they would stop testing the water supply to save money.

In addition to imposing federal control, the so-called Promesa legislation gives Puerto Rico the power to unilaterally reduce its debts, something that a debtor can normally do only in bankruptcy. Federal law explicitly bars the Puerto Rican government from entering bankruptcy, an exclusion is seen as a slap in the face by Puerto Ricans.

Banners hung near the federal courthouse said, “The problem is not the junta, it’s the colony.”

2278,"Some of its risks have backfired, however. Leucadia, which bought Jefferies in 2012, has since booked losses from the investment bank’s exposure to energy, junk bonds and Bache, the commodity division that it bought from Prudential in 2011 and sold to Société Générale last year. Leucadia also stumbled because of its own 79 percent stake in National Beef, a meat-processing business that has been struggling.

Shares of Leucadia fell 46 percent from their peak in May 2013 through last year, while those of 13 business peers rose an average 14 percent. This year, despite battling volatile markets early in the year, Leucadia has outperformed as results started to rebound. At Jefferies, profit for the second quarter, which ended in May, was 10 percent lower than the same period a year ago but compared favorably with a $167 million first-quarter loss. In a statement announcing earnings, Mr. Handler said conditions were returning to “a more normal level.”

Mr. Handler, who became the Jefferies chief executive in 2001 and chairman the following year, does not court media attention or like to be photographed. He dresses casually in polo shirts as he works in his Manhattan corner office, which is decorated with a picture of him and a fellow New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, on the wall.

Under his leadership, Jefferies had the best stock performance of any investment bank through 2012, Mr. Kotowski said, sailing relatively unscathed through the financial crisis, in part by selling a 14 percent stake to Leucadia in early 2008.

This helped Jefferies pick up bond teams from Merrill Lynch and the former First Albany Capital, and a group of 36 bankers from UBS in 2009, including the health care banker Benjamin Lorello. Troubled by the crisis, UBS had slashed banker bonuses by 80 percent.

The trading and merchant banking risks the firm now takes are no greater than those for other Wall Street dealers, say people at the firm. Jefferies says it has cut its leverage, or the ratio of assets to equity capital, from 17 in 2010 to a current 10. The current level is below that of competitors, Moody’s Investors Service said.

This year, Jefferies’s interests in the growing financial technology field put it back in the spotlight. Jefferies has packaged loans for resale to investors from upstart lenders including Avant, CircleBack Lending and OnDeck. The firm ranks an outsize No. 5 in underwriting such loan packages, according to PeerIQ, which tracks marketplace lending. Jefferies has also taken venture capital-style equity stakes in two financial tech lending start-ups, Affirm and Bond Street.

Jefferies is also linked to Lending Club, the peer-to-peer lender that has been in turmoil since an internal investigation revealed improprieties in the sale of loans and a separate disclosure issue, which resulted in the ouster of its chief executive in May. About $22 million in loans sold to Jefferies did not meet the investment bank’s criteria, and the company bought them back.

But Jefferies did end up leading a deal that packaged Lending Club loans for investors. On Monday, Lending Club announced that the near-prime $134 million deal had three times as much investor demand as needed. This heavy interest came about even though the entire marketplace lending sector has also been hit with turbulence this year as rates for new loans rose to reflect rising delinquencies.

Leucadia’s other non-Jefferies-related assets remain a grab bag, including an Italian broadband company, a plastic net maker, auto dealers, timber and real estate. And the jury is out on more than $500 million in postmerger investments in energy and gold mining, and another $500 million in hedge funds.

Mr. Kotowski of Oppenheimer is bullish, but some investors shun the stock. Ted Hart, who follows financial stocks at Tufton Capital Management in Baltimore, said the new Leucadia with Jefferies as its core was highly correlated with the high-yield debt market. In its former life as a multi-industry conglomerate, “If one business wasn’t doing well, you had another that was picking up the slack,” Mr. Hart said.

But now, he added: “The outlook for Leucadia is kind of the outlook for the high-yield market, which isn’t too rosy. With oil prices remaining low, Leucadia may continue to struggle in high-yield debt underwriting and trading. It looks cheap on a price-to-book-value basis, but it’s an entirely different company.”

Jefferies stock swooned in late 2011 after the collapse of the commodities broker MF Global raised some concerns about its exposure to European debt, which it quickly got off its balance sheet. MF Global’s fate had raised similar questions about investor exposure at Jefferies’s commodity business, Bache.

The son of a tax preparer from Fair Lawn, N.J., Mr. Handler, 55, sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door and life insurance at a bank before graduating from the University of Rochester. After a stint as a junior analyst at First Boston during its Wasserstein Perella mid-1980s heyday, he got an M.B.A. from Stanford and worked in the Los Angeles office of Drexel Burnham Lambert before that firm’s demise in 1990. He built the Jefferies junk-bond desk before he became chief executive.

At Jefferies, trading and banking often rest partly on relationships, trust and loyalty — a culture set by Mr. Handler. His dealings with Mr. Icahn, once a prominent Drexel client, illustrate that point. Jefferies led or helped lead bond sales of $3.7 billion in 2014 and $2 billion in 2010 for Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn’s main investment vehicle.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Jefferies also stood ready to arrange debt financing for attempts by Mr. Icahn to buy Clorox in 2011 and Dell in 2013. Both deals were ultimately abandoned.

Mr. Handler’s Drexel relationships were on display at an 80th birthday gathering he hosted for Mr. Icahn at a New York steakhouse in February.

On hand were Michael Milken, Drexel’s onetime junk-bond chief; Leon Black, a former top Drexel banker who is now chief executive of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management; and the former Drexel client Bennett LeBow, now chairman of the Vector Group, another staunch Jefferies client.

The same group, minus Mr. Milken, meets monthly, said an attendee, Howard Lorber, chief of the Vector Group, a tobacco producer and majority owner of the Douglas Elliman real estate brokerage firm. Mr. Handler values his close relationship with Mr. Milken, longtime associates say.

Irwin Simon, chief of Hain Celestial, recalled that as he got to know Mr. Icahn and Mr. Handler, he wound up having dinner at Mr. Icahn’s beachfront mansion in East Hampton. And after he had knee surgery, Mr. Handler visited him at home. “He’s a tough negotiator and good businessman,” Mr. Simon said. “I believe he is a very honest and loyal person, but I wouldn’t want to cross him.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2286,"DE KALB, Miss. — The fortress of steel and concrete towering above the pine forest here is a first-of-its-kind power plant that was supposed to prove that “clean coal” was not an oxymoron — that it was possible to produce electricity from coal in a way that emits far less pollution, and to turn a profit while doing so.

The plant was not only a central piece of the Obama administration’s climate plan, it was also supposed to be a model for future power plants to help slow the dangerous effects of global warming. The project was hailed as a way to bring thousands of jobs to Mississippi, the nation’s poorest state, and to extend a lifeline to the dying coal industry.

The sense of hope is fading fast, however. The Kemper coal plant is more than two years behind schedule and more than $4 billion over its initial budget, $2.4 billion, and it is still not operational.

The plant and its owner, Southern Company, are the focus of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and ratepayers, alleging fraud, are suing the company. Members of Congress have described the project as more boondoggle than boon. The mismanagement is particularly egregious, they say, given the urgent need to rein in the largest source of dangerous emissions around the world: coal plants.

The plant’s backers, including federal energy officials, have defended their work in recent years by saying that delays and cost overruns are inevitable with innovative projects of this scale. In this case, they say, the difficulties stem largely from unforeseen factors — or “unknown unknowns,” as Tom Fanning, the chief executive of Southern Company, has often called them — like bad weather, labor shortages and design uncertainties.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Many problems plaguing the project were broadly known and had been occurring for years. But a review by The New York Times of thousands of pages of public records, previously undisclosed internal documents and emails, and 200 hours of secretly though legally recorded conversations among more than a dozen colleagues at the plant offers a detailed look at what went wrong and why.

Those documents and recordings, provided to The Times by a whistle-blower, an engineer named Brett Wingo, and interviews with more than 30 current or former regulators, contractors, consultants or engineers who worked on the project, show that the plant’s owners drastically understated the project’s cost and timetable, and repeatedly tried to conceal problems as they emerged.

The system of checks and balances that are supposed to keep such projects on track was outweighed by a shared and powerful incentive: The company and regulators were eager to qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal subsidies for the plant, which was also aggressively promoted by Haley Barbour, who was Southern’s chief lobbyist before becoming the governor of Mississippi. Once in office, Mr. Barbour signed a law in 2008 that allowed much of the cost of building any new power plants to be passed on to ratepayers before they are built.

Seeing so many of the problems from the inside, at least one employee felt the need to speak up.

“I’ve reached a personal tipping point and feel a duty to act,” Mr. Wingo wrote in a 2014 email, which was among several that he sent to officials of Southern Company and Mississippi Power, the state utility that runs the plant, alleging that the company had broken federal law and engaged in corporate fraud. “Hope is not a strategy,” he added. “This is a high-profile project with many misguided enemies, so why give them free ammo?”

In their recorded conversations with Mr. Wingo, at least six senior engineers from the plant said that they believed that the delays and cost overruns, as well as safety violations and shoddy work, were partly the result of mismanagement or fraud.

“It has nothing to do with the design, it has nothing to do with the technology, it just has to do with poor project management,” Landon Lunsford, an engineer at the plant, said during one recorded call with Mr. Wingo last December, when they discussed an email from Southern’s legal department telling senior employees to retain all emails because of a continuing S.E.C. investigation.

The company will never admit the project-management problems because they will attract more scrutiny from regulators, Mr. Lunsford said. “As long as they can talk away the results as attributable to something else other than just poor performance, the other public service commissions can’t hold them over the fire as much,” he added.

Officials from Southern Company and Mississippi Power, which is a Southern subsidiary, said that they could not comment on Mr. Wingo’s allegations but that all decisions about cost and budget projections were made by consensus. They also said that Mr. Wingo’s accusations had previously been investigated by the company and could not be substantiated. Mr. Wingo was fired in February, a move that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration later ruled illegal.

Ed Holland, the former chief executive of Mississippi Power, added that one of the project’s biggest mistakes was to start construction with little of the plant designed. “We still believe that from our investors’ standpoint, this was a wise investment to prove the technology,” he said in an interview.

In the end, the Kemper project is a story of how a monopoly utility, with political help from the Mississippi governor and from federal energy officials who pressured state regulators in letters to support the project, shifted the burden of one of the most expensive power plants ever built onto the shoulders of unwitting investors and some of the lowest-income ratepayers in the country.

Kemper’s rising price tag and other problems will probably affect the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed rules on new power plants, and also play into broader discussions about the best way to counter climate change. E.P.A. regulations in effect require new coal plants to have carbon capture technology but are being held up in federal court partly by arguments that the technology is not cost-effective.

The importance of this technology grows, as well, after President Obama said last week that the United States would join Canada and Mexico in pledging to reach a shared goal of generating 50 percent of North America’s electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2025, up from 37 percent today, with a power mix that includes wind, solar, hydropower, nuclear energy and coal or gas power paired with carbon capture technology.

“The big question with clean coal has always been whether it’s a moonshot or a money pit,” said Charles Grayson, the director of the Bigger Pie Forum, which advocates fiscal conservatism in Mississippi and has been critical of the Kemper project for years. “The Obama administration and my state made a really bad wager in trying to use Kemper to make the economic argument for this technology.”

High Hopes

Coal represents a conundrum: It is among the dirtiest sources of fuel, producing roughly 45 percent of the emissions that contribute to climate change. And yet the world still relies on it for power, with more than a quarter of the electricity used globally coming from coal plants.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

When I first set foot onto the hot sand of a Bulgarian beach and laid eyes on the Black Sea, I thought to myself, “This has to be the ocean.” I was wrong, of course, but I couldn’t get over how vast it was, stretching seemingly forever toward the horizon.

The Black Sea, which connects southeastern Europe to western Asia, covers more than 160,000 square miles, making it about the size of California. It’s encircled by a half-dozen countries, including Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria.

It’s also the perfect place for the traveler looking for a great deal. I spent a few days traversing the Bulgarian Black Sea coast by car, enjoying the bright, sunny weather, stunning ocean views and elegant, ancient cities that gild its shoreline. I wouldn’t be surprised if this corner of the world became the new “hot” destination in Eastern Europe, with its abundance of inexpensive lodging, fantastic seafood and gorgeous (free) beaches.

It’s also not as tough to get to as you might expect. There were (as of this writing) some good round-trip airfares from the United States to Sofia, the capital, as low as $603 from Kennedy or $612 from Chicago for dates in September.

It’s also worth noting that Sofia and Plovdiv, a city 90 miles east of the capital, are destinations of the low-budget carrier Ryanair. One-way flights from Sofia to London cost as little as $19 (I took advantage of a cheap Ryanair flight to London out of Bulgaria).

Once on the ground, you’ll need a car. I picked one up from Sixt Rent a Car. I hadn’t heard of Sixt before (it’s a German company), but was happy enough with the rate I was paying for my economy rental: 15 euros (about $17) per day, before taxes. I also hadn’t heard of the make or model of the car I received, something called a Dacia Sandero. It was a tiny little box that occasionally shook when a stiff wind, or large truck, blew past it but otherwise performed admirably.

It was also a stick shift — luckily, after a few hours my high school driver’s ed class kicked in. It helped that the roads are good in Bulgaria and that the main highway, the A1, is a four-lane road with a passing lane on each side. When you’re on a two-lane road, however, you should drive defensively: Bulgarian drivers are aggressive passers. Don’t tempt fate, and take your time.

I passed through the small town of Haskovo on my way to the sea, meeting up with some family members to attend the wedding of my American cousin Matthew and Tanya, his fiancée, who is from Bulgaria.

I spent the night at the spacious and stylish Hotel Retro, where I had a huge room with air-conditioning for 71 lev, about $40. I also enjoyed the first of many shopska salads, a refreshing mixture of tomato, cucumber and onion lightly dressed in olive oil. From Haskovo, it was an uneventful two-hour drive to the Black Sea.

I used the small city of Burgas and the modest Guest House Fotinov (65 lev per night) as my home base. The imposing Hotel Bulgaria is another option in the center of town — a huge 17-floor concrete monolith. Rooms are large and there are views, but the cost is roughly twice what I paid. “It’s nice,” my cousin Tanya said. “Well ... it’s communist nice,” she added. One plus: Within steps of the hotel is the small, elegant Holy Cross Armenian Church, built in 1673.

Indeed, the area is steeped in history. I love the rich, deep sense of the past that pervades areas like Burgas and the nearby towns of Nessebar and Sozopol. Around the seventh century B.C., Greek colonizers moved into old Thracian settlements on the western Black Sea coast. The archaeological museum in Burgas contains some fascinating Bronze Age artifacts, including the oldest marble statue found in Bulgaria. (Admission to the museum is 5 lev, and it’s only 10 lev for a combination ticket to visit all four museums in town.)

UKRAINE RUSSIA ROMANIA Black Sea GEORGIA BULGARIA TURKEY 200 miles 80 miles Romania serbia Bulgaria Nessebar Sofia Burgas Sozopol Haskovo Macedonia Turkey Greece

While I found few English speakers in Bulgaria generally, a woman working at the museum spoke some, and kindly walked me around town to show me the locations of the other museums. Most signage in Burgas is in Bulgarian, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Many businesses, however, especially those that cater to tourists, offer translations.

While the history in Burgas is impressive, I was even more taken by the quality and price of the food. I went to Sladko & Soleno, a small bakery on Aleksandrovska Street, and had a series of great sweets, cookies and breads. My favorite was probably the big, soft kashkavalka, a pliant loaf of bread covered in cheese. Another day, I stopped by a small doner kebab stand on Aleko Bogoridi Boulevard and picked up a big flatbread stuffed with grilled chicken, French fries and parsley-based slaw for 3 lev.

Even the stingiest traveler doesn’t have to be stuck with bakeries and street food, however — in Bulgaria, a nice sit-down dinner is easy on the wallet. Bistro Oreha is an excellent restaurant with outdoor seating on the main pedestrian mall in downtown Burgas. The ubiquitous shopska salad was great but the seafood really excelled. A bucket of meaty mussels dressed in herbs and a tangy, slightly spicy sauce cost 11 lev. A plate of ultra-tender, deep-fried baby squid with a creamy, garlicky sauce cost another 11 lev. Alcohol won’t set you back too far, either: A half-liter of local Burgasko beer costs 2 lev.

Exploring the town by foot is satisfying, but Burgas is big, and more ground can be covered by bike. I rented a two-wheeler through its bike-share program, which required buying a small magnetic tap-card for 10 lev. As opposed to renting the bike for a flat day rate, you get 10 hours of bike usage with the card and tap in and out every time you take or return a bike to one of the many kiosks around town, truly maximizing your lev.

I used my bike time primarily to explore the Sea Garden, a spacious park that runs along the eastern border of the city along the Black Sea. The park, designed near the turn of the 20th century, is home to public art installations, a public swimming pool, summer theater and, of course, miles of biking paths and great views of the sea.

Burgas isn’t the only town on Bulgaria’s coast that’s worth checking out, and other charming places are within easy striking distance. I made the half-hour drive up the coast to Nessebar, a 3,000-year-old former Greek colony that is now a Unesco World Heritage site. The old city is connected to the main town by a thin, man-made isthmus. It’s easy to park your car for a handful of lev and spend a few hours exploring the ruins of the old town and its dozens of churches, some from as far back as the fifth or sixth century.

Photo

Exploring all of Nessebar’s churches and museums would have taken all day, but I did check out several. My favorite was the peaceful St. Stephen church, a three-nave basilica that dates to the 11th century. (If you are looking to visit many of the churches in Nessebar, it’s worth getting a seven-museum pass for 20 lev.) It’s mostly just fun to walk the town’s cobblestone streets, grab a freshly squeezed orange juice (I paid 4.20 lev for a large plastic cup) and maybe do a little shopping.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

PARIS — There is a back story to the strikes that have made life miserable for millions across France in recent weeks, and it isn’t about high unemployment, immigration or the other issues confronting the country and its increasingly unpopular president, François Hollande.

It has to do with raw labor politics — and the disproportionate role played by the General Confederation of Labor, France’s oldest union, which has ties to the once-powerful Communist Party, from which it has kept a Marxist-Leninist call to class struggle.

With just under 700,000 members, most of them in the public sector, the C.G.T., as it is commonly known, has moved its fight against a proposed labor law beyond the streets.

It has spearheaded mass demonstrations, and small numbers of militant strikers have blocked the gates of oil refineries, nuclear power stations, wholesale food markets and waste treatment facilities.

Joined by smaller, more radical unions, the strikes have spread, as rail workers and Air France pilots piled on with narrow demands unrelated to the labor law.

Fueling the unrest is widespread dissatisfaction with a Socialist government seen as having betrayed its leftist principles, which explains recent vandalism against local party headquarters.

At the heart of it all is the C.G.T., which is now battling to hold its place as France’s No. 1 union, a position it has traditionally used to face down successive French governments on the right and on the left.

This time, the union has resorted to strong-arm methods that have been described as terrorist by Pierre Gattaz, president of the Medef, the main business lobbying group in France.

The most striking example came on May 26 when the union shut down publication of France’s largest newspapers after they refused to publish a full-page opinion piece written by Philippe Martinez, the union’s recently elected general secretary.

“The C.G.T. is going for broke,” wrote Michel Noblecourt, the labor correspondent at Le Monde, the French newspaper. “It has been weakened in its historic bastions and ahead of union elections in March 2017, there are strong risks that it will find itself” in second place.

The paradox is that France is one of the least unionized countries in Europe. According to a government study issued last month, only 11.2 percent of French workers, about 2.9 million, belonged to the country’s eight main unions in 2013, more than two-thirds in the public sector.

In 2014, the C.G.T. had 676,623 members, down 2 percent from the previous year, according to the union’s figures.

At union elections in 2013, it earned 26.7 percent of the votes, just ahead of the 26 percent received by its moderate rival, the French Democratic Confederation of Labor, which did not join the strikes this spring.

After his election last April as leader of the C.G.T., Mr. Martinez was open about his agenda.

“Our fear,” he said at the time, “is to no longer be the first union organization in France.”

Asked on May 26 whether it was time to end the strikes, Mr. Martinez said, “I am like an airplane. I am just taking off.”

The question is whether these militant tactics will pay off. The French are traditionally tolerant of labor action, but this time, as the garbage piles up and commuters fight their way onto crowded trains, there are signs that the union may have overplayed its hand.

But it has already exacted a price. Seeking to end the social unrest, the government has stripped the proposed labor law of most of its consequential elements.

Little is left of the original ambition to loosen France’s rigid labor market, but with an exception that is a source of extreme concern for the C.G.T.: a rule that would allow employers to negotiate with unions at the factory — rather than the sector — level.

The union’s influence has always come from its role as an actor on the national stage, capable of going head-to-head against the government. A devolution to the local level would be a blow to its disproportionate power, which could mean that these last weeks of chaos might end up being the C.G.T.’s swan song.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

SAN FRANCISCO — In its quest to build a global empire, Uber has turned to the Middle East for its biggest infusion of cash from a single investor.

Uber said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s main investment fund, in one of the largest-ever investments into a privately held start-up.

The money was part of the ride-hailing giant’s most recent financing round and continued to value Uber at $62.5 billion. The investment, which was months in the making, does not cash out any of Uber’s existing investors.

Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment.

Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known for venture capital investing, though some members of its royal family have made some deals. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, for instance, has invested in Lyft, a competitor of Uber.

“We appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,” Travis Kalanick, one of Uber’s founders and its chief executive, said in a statement. “Our experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.”

The investment came together after David Plouffe, an Uber board member, traveled to the Middle East in March and was invited to the Saudi fund for a briefing. The discussions heated up thereafter, culminating in the deal.

Uber, which is Silicon Valley’s most valuable private business, has collected more than $11 billion from investors since its inception. The company has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash at a rapid pace of once every six months or so, to fuel its operations globally.

Uber has drawn capital from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds, like that of Qatar, have also invested.

Other tech darlings have been busy raising money from private investors as well, pushing back any need to join the public stock markets.

The messaging company Snapchat raised $1.8 billion in its most recent round, according to a regulatory filing last month. Among Snapchat’s new investors in the round were the Alibaba Group of China and the investment firms General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Lone Pine Capital.

Other tech start-ups have not fared as well in raising money over the last several months. Some so-called unicorns — businesses valued at more than $1 billion — have struggled, and several, like the wearables maker Jawbone, have had to raise money at lower valuations.

Uber has been spending not only to expand but also to defend its territory — which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries — against incumbents in regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country.

The Middle East is among Uber’s increasingly important overseas markets; the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million there. Uber has rolled out its service in 15 cities and nine countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia.

The start-up said that it now has over 395,000 active riders in the Middle East, up fivefold from a year ago, and 19,000 drivers.

Uber said expanding its service may be a boon for Saudi Arabia, a country where women are not allowed to drive because of fatwas, or religious edicts, issued by conservative Muslim clerics that uphold a distinct segregation between the sexes. There is no formal law prohibiting women from driving in the region.

“Of course we think women should be allowed to drive,” said Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman. “In the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn’t exist before — and we’re incredibly proud of that.”

Still, Uber did not say that it planned to hire women drivers in the country, unlike in most other regions where the company operates.

Roughly 80 percent of Uber’s riders in Saudi Arabia are women, according to the company. Uber has sought to aid the kingdom’s Vision 2030 plan, which includes more than doubling the number of women in the overall work force by 2030, to 30 percent.

Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, who sits on Uber’s public policy advisory board, has worked with Uber to usher the service into the country and has the support of female users of the service, said in an interview that the investment was a clear sign of change coming to the region.

Saudi Arabia has looked for ways to expand its economy beyond oil, with the Public Investment Fund — which is expected to grow to $2 trillion under management after the country’s state-owned oil company goes public — serving as a crucial part of that strategy. The $3.5 billion investment in Uber is out of the Saudi fund’s roughly $750 billion in total United States assets.

Investing in an American company like Uber, however, could run counter to Saudi Arabia’s threat to sell off investments in the United States, issued during discussion about a bill in Congress that would allow the kingdom to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Part of Uber’s possible attraction in bringing in a sovereign wealth fund like Saudi Arabia’s is that such investors have far longer investment horizons than venture capitalists, who generally seek to cash out their investments after seven to 10 years.

As part of the investment, the managing director at the Public Investment Fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, will take a seat on Uber’s board, joining Mr. Kalanick and other directors, including Arianna Huffington.

“We’ve seen firsthand how this company has improved urban mobility around the world, and we’re looking forward to being part of that progress,” Mr. Al Rumayyan said in a statement.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2305,"“Immunotherapy represents a hugely important new tool, but chemotherapy can work too and has been the backbone of the way we’ve treated patients with lung cancer,” he said. “Immunotherapy is not a replacement for that. It’s a new weapon.”

One of his patients, a 60-year-old man with lung cancer that had spread to his brain, was eager to try immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy. After having radiation treatment for one brain tumor, he began treatment with two checkpoint inhibitors.

But they did not work. So his doctors switched to chemotherapy. “He’s had a tremendous response,” Dr. Hellmann said.

He said it was impossible to tell whether the immunotherapy could have had some delayed effect and worked synergistically with the chemotherapy. Clinical trials are now trying to resolve that question.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But the potential for dangerous side effects cannot be overemphasized, doctors say. A 2010 article in a medical journal reported that a few melanoma patients had died from adverse effects of Yervoy.

In addition to causing lung inflammation, checkpoint inhibitors can lead to rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, a severe inflammation of the intestine — the result of an attack by the revved-up immune system that over-the-counter remedies cannot treat. Patients need steroids like prednisone to quell these attacks. Fortunately — and mysteriously, Dr. Wolchok said — the steroids can halt the gut trouble without stopping the immune fight against the cancer. But if patients delay telling doctors about diarrhea, Dr. Wolchok warned, “they could die” from colitis.

Checkpoint inhibitors can also slow down vital glands — pituitary, adrenal or thyroid — creating a permanent need for hormone treatment. Mr. Cara, for instance, now needs thyroid medication, almost certainly as a result of his treatment. Doctors have reported that a patient with a kidney transplant rejected it after taking a checkpoint inhibitor to treat cancer, apparently because the drug spurred his immune system to attack the organ.

Another of Dr. Hellmann’s lung-cancer patients, Joanne Sabol, 65, had to quit a checkpoint inhibitor because of severe colitis. But she had taken it for about two years, and it shrank a large abdominal tumor by 78 percent. Patients like her are in uncharted territory, and doctors are trying to decide whether to operate to remove what is left of her tumor.

“I have aggressive cancer, but I’m not giving in to it,” Ms. Sabol said. “It’s going to be a big battle with me.”

Coley’s Toxins

Dr. William B. Coley, an American surgeon born in 1862, is widely considered the father of cancer immunotherapy. But he practiced a crude form of it, without understanding how it worked.

Distressed by the painful death of a young woman he had treated for a sarcoma, a bone cancer, in 1891, Dr. Coley began to study the records of other sarcoma patients in New York, according to Dr. David. B. Levine, a medical historian and orthopedic surgeon.

One case leapt out at him: a patient who had several unsuccessful operations to remove a huge sarcoma from his face, and wound up with a severe infection, then called erysipelas, caused by Streptococcal bacteria. The patient was not expected to survive, but he did — and the cancer disappeared.

Photo

Dr. Coley found other cases in which cancer went away after erysipelas. Not much was known about the immune system, and he suspected, mistakenly, that the bacteria were somehow destroying the tumors. Researchers today think the infection set off an intense immune response that killed both the germs and the cancer.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Dr. Coley was not alone in believing that bacteria could fight cancer. In a letter to a colleague in 1890, the Russian physician and playwright Anton Chekhov wrote of erysipelas: “It has long been noted that the growth of malignant tumors halts for a time when this disease is present.”

Dr. Coley began to inject terminally ill cancer patients with Streptococcal bacteria in the 1890s. His first patient, a drug addict with an advanced sarcoma, was expected to die within weeks, but the disease went into remission and he lived eight years.

Dr. Coley treated other patients, with mixed results. Some tumors regressed, but sometimes the bacteria caused infections that went out of control. Dr. Coley developed an extract of heat-killed bacteria that came to be called Coley’s mixed toxins, and he treated hundreds of patients over several decades. Many became quite ill, with shaking chills and raging fevers. But some were cured.

Parke-Davis and Company began producing Coley’s toxins in 1899, and continued for 30 years. Various hospitals in Europe and the United States, including the Mayo Clinic, used the toxins, but the results were not consistent.

Early in the 20th century, radiation treatment came into use. Its results were more predictable, and the cancer establishment began turning away from Coley’s toxins. Dr. Coley’s own institution, Memorial Hospital (now Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) instituted a policy in 1915 stating that inpatients had to be given radiation, not the toxins. Some other hospitals continued using them, but interest gradually waned. Dr. Coley died in 1936.

Chemotherapy, developed after World War II, was another blow to his methods. And in 1965, the American Cancer Society added Coley’s toxins to its list of “unproven” treatments. (The toxins were later taken off the list.)

After Dr. Coley’s death, his daughter, Helen Coley Nauts, studied some 800 case records that he had left behind, and became convinced that he was onto something important. She tried to rekindle interest in his work, but she was thwarted by doctors who opposed it, including some with high rank at Sloan Kettering. However, in 1953 she founded the Cancer Research Institute in New York, a nonprofit that has become a significant supporter of research on the interplay between cancer and the immune system. The group awarded more than $29.4 million in scientific grants in 2015, and its advisory board includes Dr. Wolchok and the scientist credited with developing the first checkpoint inhibitor, James P. Allison.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

FRANKFURT — The European Central Bank made no changes on Thursday in its program to revive the eurozone economy, as it expressed slightly more optimism about the prospects for growth in the region.

The lack of any significant policy moves was expected. Growth in the 19-member eurozone is neither so terrible that it requires a new burst of stimulus from the bank nor so torrid that there is a need to apply the brakes, analysts say. The European Central Bank’s Governing Council is now expected to pause for a while, after several years in which it pushed the boundaries of monetary policy.

The bank left its benchmark interest rate at zero, where it has been since March. It also left intact a penalty rate of minus 0.4 percent on money that commercial banks keep at the central bank. The so-called negative interest rate is designed to force commercial banks to lend money rather than hoard it.

Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said that growth in the eurozone this year would be 1.6 percent, slightly more than earlier forecasts. But the bank’s economists left their growth predictions for 2017 and 2018 unchanged at 1.7 percent for both years.

Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in Vienna that although the risks facing the eurozone had declined, “it’s not a dramatic effect.”

The bank has already made aggressive moves in recent months by buying government debt in large quantities and cutting interest rates to their lowest levels. This month, the bank will expand those measures by buying corporate bonds and by effectively paying banks to lend to businesses, all in a bid to spur Europe’s economy.

Analysts would have been surprised, indeed shocked, if the bank had taken action on Thursday after a monetary policy meeting in Vienna, one of the Governing Council’s periodic forays outside its base in Frankfurt.

The bank is also not expected to make any major changes to policy for some time to come. The meeting on Thursday “was a continuation of a series of wait-and-see events,” Christoph Kutt, head of interest rate strategy at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, said in an email.

Inflation in the eurozone was minus 0.1 percent in May, according to an official estimate on Tuesday, still far from the bank’s official target of 2 percent. But a 1 percent increase in the price of services in May, as well as a turnaround in oil prices that has pushed them near $50 a barrel from around half that in January, signal that overall inflation could rise in months to come.

To the disappointment of some analysts, the central bank did not raise its inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018. That is a sign that the bank remains concerned about the risk of deflation, a sustained decline in prices that can be disastrous for economic growth and employment.

The European Central Bank’s charter defines its main job as keeping inflation below 2 percent, but not too far below it.

Another reason the central bank had not been expected to announce new stimulus on Thursday is that its previous measures are just going into effect. In March, it said it would begin buying corporate bonds in an expansion of its so-called quantitative easing program, a way of pumping money into the economy. Those purchases are scheduled to begin on June 8.

In addition, the central bank will begin a program on June 22 intended to address a shortage of credit in countries like Italy. Under some circumstances, the European Central Bank will pay commercial banks to take its money, which the banks must lend to customers.

The central bank will want to take some time to see how those programs are working, analysts said.

The eurozone economy is recovering, but slowly and unevenly. During the first quarter, the total value of goods and services produced in the eurozone surpassed the previous peak reached in early 2008, before the region was struck by financial and debt crises.

But unemployment remains above 10 percent and is falling only gradually, and eurozone growth is not so brisk that economists see any need for the bank to think about removing stimulus to prevent overheating. That is in contrast to the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise interest rates in the United States as early as its next meeting, June 14 and 15.

Along with questions about the direction of the economy, there is potential for a new crisis that would push the European Central Bank to mobilize.

Britain will hold a referendum on June 23 about whether to remain a member of the European Union. A vote to quit the union would raise concerns that other members would leave, perhaps causing the bloc to fall apart. The uncertainty would have an economic effect, making businesses cautious about hiring and investing.

In such a situation, the central bank would be under pressure to intervene once again.

Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that he and other members of the Governing Council believed that Britain should remain in the European Union. But if British voters elect to leave, he said, “The E.C.B. is ready for all contingencies.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2308,"MARKETS SHAKY AS POLITICAL CHAOS CONTINUES IN THE WAKE OF ‘BREXIT’ | The turmoil that roiled markets on Friday gave way to weak sentiment on Monday morning, as uncertainty created by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union weighed on Asian stocks, Reuters reports. The pound tumbled further, sliding 2 percent in Asia on Monday, but the extreme volatility of last week receded a little. The euro also remained under pressure, while European stocks started the week with a slump and continued to slide later in the day. As with last week, banking stocks were battered. Shares in Barclays and RBS fell so much that they were suspended from trading.

At the same time, the political chaos in Britain continued into Monday. The opposition Labour Party split into warring camps, while the governing Conservatives were drawing their battle lines, Steven Erlanger reports in The New York Times.

Speaking before the European market open, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said he expected more volatility, but noted that the British economy was “about as strong as it could be” and in a position to weather the effects of leaving the European Union, Jonathan Soble and Prashant S. Rao report in The New York Times. The pound pared some of its losses after his speech.

Premier Li Keqiang of China also noted on Monday that the referendum result had increased uncertainty in the global economy, Reuters reports. “Against the backdrop of globalization, it’s impossible for each country to talk about its own development discarding the world economic environment,” Mr. Li said at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China.

Their concerns over the uncertain outlook are shared across the world.

London became a world financial center after a wave of financial deregulation thirty years ago, but a cloud of uncertainty hangs over it now. On Friday, finance workers congregated at pubs in the City, as Britain’s Wall Street is known, pondering where jobs might move, Danny Hakim and Prashant S. Rao report in DealBook. Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt seemed the mostly likely options, but few were excited about the prospect. Some worried about returning to financial crisis conditions.

Some experts have also raised the possibility that the British government could seek to save the financial sector by making the City more attractive as an offshore haven, Nelson D. Schwartz and Patricia Cohen report in The New York Times. “This could lead to London becoming even more like the Cayman Islands and other British territories, skirting around regulations, in a race to the bottom for the financial sector,” Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said. “This potentially could leave pretty big holes in the financial safety net.”

The art market is also fearful, Robin Pogrebin reports in The New York Times. London was regarded as the capital of the European art market, but lots may be withdrawn this week by nervous consignors. Experts predicted that fewer pieces would come to market in Britain because of the fall in the value of the pound, although some are bullish about this, saying that it makes prices more attractive to foreign buyers. Others still think that people’s trust in hard assets will keep the market going.

Meanwhile, the world’s central bankers are worried about how much action they can take should markets spiral, Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook. Investors expect central banks to ride to the rescue if the vote sends global markets reeling, but some investors and economists fear that further intervention will worsen the sense of alienation and frustration at global elites that helped the “leave” side win the vote.

Moves like bond buying and lowering interest rates used to be seen as easy policy substitutes when governments did not take action themselves. But the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. When finance is hit by social and political crises, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend intervention. It is an acute concern for Britain, where, thanks to aggressive central bank policies, house prices have soared in London even as the inflation-adjusted average wage is still lower than it was before the financial crisis.

The Japanese authorities said on Monday that they were prepared to intervene to curb the rise of the yen, which can hurt Japanese exports.

Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, said he had instructed the finance minister, Taro Aso, to “coordinate with the Bank of Japan and be even more mindful of movements in the markets, including the currency market.” The yen ticked down against the dollar after he spoke.

The Italian government is also considering measures to prop up its banking sector, as financial stocks come under more pressure after the vote, The Financial Times reports, citing bankers and officials. Prime minister Matteo Renzi may request a suspension of state aid rules to allow a government-sponsored capital injection.

The hedge fund industry has been comparatively placid about Britain’s vote to leave the European Union,, although some were surprised by the result, Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook. Many fund managers watched the vote from the sidelines, and some had yet to recover from the turmoil created by Chinese stocks last summer.

It will take some time to determine the winners, but George Soros, known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, looked smart after taking long positions in gold through an exchange-traded fund. Whether he took any positions to profit from a vote for so-called Brexit is unclear.

In the meantime, Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has called for Britain and the European Union to move quickly to quell the uncertainty, The Financial Times reports. Ms. Lagarde noted the turmoil within Britain’s political parties and said that European Union leaders had sent mixed messages on how Britain’s exit from the bloc should be handled.

“At this point in time, policy makers both in the U.K. and in Europe are holding that level of uncertainty in their hands, and how they come out in the next few days is really going to drive the direction in which risk will go,” she said on Sunday.

Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain is expected to lead an emergency Cabinet meeting on Monday, and John Kerry, the United States secretary of state, is visiting Brussels and London to address the fallout from the vote.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2309,"On Friday, the White House announced that it would provide $7.5 million in grants to organizations interested in working with states to reduce overly burdensome licensing and make it easier for licensed practitioners to work across state lines, an issue of particular importance to military families.

“This grant is the first time the federal government has directly gotten involved to help states that want to reform their licensing practices,” Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. “It was something a Democratic president proposed and a Republican Congress passed.”

Economists on both the left and the right argue that excessive licensing raises prices for consumers without improving services; it can also deter potential workers from moving across state lines, dragging down employment growth.

“There is no labor economist who thinks it is good for the economy,” said Lee U. McGrath, legislative counsel in Minnesota for the Institute for Justice, a libertarian organization whose lawyers are representing Ms. Granatelli in a lawsuit against the Arizona veterinary board.

In Tennessee, a license is required to shampoo hair; in Florida, to sell a yacht. In Montana, you need the state’s approval to be an egg candler; in Utah, to repair upholstery; in Louisiana, to be a florist.

No one disputes that health and safety concerns make licenses indispensable in certain demanding professions, like nursing or flying a commercial airplane, and they are sometimes helpful in improving standards and providing quality assurance to consumers.

But the current mishmash of requirements is too often “inconsistent, inefficient, and arbitrary,” a White House report concluded last year. Many of them, the report said, have little purpose other than to protect those already in the field from further competition.

Requirements for the same job often have whiplash-level variation. South Dakota requires 2,100 hours of education and a cosmetology license to braid hair — a popular entry point into the labor force for African-American women. South Carolina demands only a six-hour course.

Security guards in Michigan need to have three years of training; none is needed in New Hampshire and Ohio.

“Why in the world do we regulate barbers?” asked Mark Hutchison, a Republican and the lieutenant governor of Nevada, which shares billing with Arizona as one of the states with the most burdensome licensing requirements, according to the Institute for Justice. “A bad haircut is the last thing that a person is going to put up with and return to. It is the ultimate example of self-regulating industry.”

The problem is particularly acute for military spouses, who move frequently, as well as veterans and immigrants, who may have extensive training but lack a particular state’s seal of approval. And there are at least 27,000 different licensing restrictions across the states affecting people with arrest and conviction records. Most of them permanently disqualify applicants, meaning a minor transgression as a teenager can prevent someone from working in many fields decades later.

The most regulated states, paradoxically, are red. “Even Republican governors with Republican legislatures in pretty conservative states have still found it extremely difficult to effect change,” said Dick M. Carpenter, strategic director of the Institute for Justice. “When there is an effort to dial back legislation, then the licensed industry turns out with huge counterattack. This is the same story that plays out in every state.”

Only rarely are licensing requirements removed. Last month, though, Arizona agreed to curb them for yoga teachers, geologists, citrus fruit packers and cremationists.

But dozens more professions escaped the ax. “Arizona is perceived as a low-regulatory state, but this was the most difficult bill we worked on this session,” said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the Republican governor, Douglas Ducey.

Licensing boards are generally dominated by members of the regulated profession. And in Arizona, more than two dozen of the boards are allowed to keep 90 percent of their fees, turning over a mere 10 percent of the revenue to the state.

“They use that money to hire contract lobbyists and P.R. people,” Mr. Scarpinato said. “This is really a dark corner of state government.”

They are often joined in their campaign by lobbyists from industry trade associations and for-profit colleges, which sell the required training courses.

Economists like Mr. Kleiner say there are less burdensome ways to highlight quality. For example, certification, with an exam to ensure a certain skill level, could be required to use a particular job title — like certified tour guide or chartered financial analyst — without prohibiting others from offering the service, perhaps at a lower price.

The power of licensing boards was challenged last year when the Supreme Court ruled that the North Carolina dental board could be sued under federal antitrust laws for shutting down teeth-whiteners because they were not licensed dentists.

The court’s decision may prompt some states to monitor licensing boards more closely, said Robert C. Fellmeth, executive director of the Center for Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego.

At the state level, the Institute for Justice has filed lawsuits arguing that various licensing boards are unconstitutionally interfering with the right to earn a living. That includes the one brought by Ms. Grantelli and two experienced horse massagers, Celeste Kelly and Stacey Kollman in Arizona.

Victoria Whitmore, executive director of the vet board in Arizona, said the board’s decision had been misinterpreted. It issued a “cease-and-desist to stop practicing veterinary medicine, not to stop massaging,” she said. The problem, the institute’s lawyers say, is that there is no way for practitioners to figure out where to draw that line.

Once the lawsuit is finished, Ms. Whitmore said, it is possible the board will offer more guidelines.

Ms. Kelly, whose strong hands can zero in on a knotted muscle like a heat-seeking missile, said she was continuing to work despite the order from the licensing board. She grew up around horses at her father’s riding stable in Long Island and has taken several courses and workshops in equine massage

Local veterinarians have frequently referred horse owners to her. “They don’t want to do it,” said Ms. Kelly, who charges $55 for an approximately 90-minute massage. “It takes too long.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

BUENOS AIRES — Argentina is changing political direction again, in a century-old zigzag from left to right and back. Traumatic though this obsessive ritual is, what is most amazing is that the language almost never changes: The powers that be are corrupt. Throw them out.

This holds true across the political spectrum. Charged with corruption, an incumbent is ousted by voters or a coup. An appearance in court often follows, but the investigation goes nowhere at the hands of politically wary investigators or judges. Eventually, the reformers are themselves tarred with corruption charges, and the cycle repeats itself.

The current turnabout features the populist Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who was president from 2007 to last year, and her husband, Néstor, who preceded her from 2003 to 2007 and died in 2010. Her center-right successor, Mauricio Macri, ran on promises of ending their alleged corruption and fixing Argentina’s economy. The outcome: Ms. Kirchner has been indicted on charges of organizing a currency trade at an artificially low price that benefited rich investors and cost Argentina’s Central Bank billions of dollars. Meanwhile, television news is rife with images of earth movers digging up a Patagonian farm where a vast Kirchner fortune is rumored to be buried. Other Kirchner-era officials are accused of bribe taking, embezzling and misappropriating public funds.

Does this mean Mrs. Kirchner is forever humbled? Hardly. A large slice of the population still sees her as a champion of the underprivileged — and a strong potential contender for president in 2019.

Extraordinary as this may appear to outsiders, none of it is new to Argentines.

Nasty political divides date from Argentina’s independence from Spain early in the 19th century, a time of bloody disputes between advocates of local authority or strong central rule. Revolts and civil wars followed each other, as landlords battled rival landlords, using gauchos — mounted cowhands — as soldiers.

In the 20th century, enduring rifts opened between caudillos — commanding figures who appealed to the masses — and more elitist leaders, with all sides typically saying their foes were corrupt. In 1930, after the progressive president Hipólito Yrigoyen was overthrown in a military coup, he was imprisoned on charges involving fraudulent government purchases. But none of the accusations were proved.

In the 1940s and ’50s, the populist general Juan Perón and his second wife, Eva, accused “oligarchs” of exploiting the working class. Generals aligned with the upper class that the Peróns vilified ousted Mr. Perón from the presidency in 1955 and ordered an inquiry into allegations against him that included embezzlement of Argentine agricultural export earnings and sexual exploits with teenage girls. But even a lengthy investigation (and a posthumous public exhibition of Eva’s jewelry collection) did not yield conclusive findings.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton greets Elizabeth Warren in the cream-and-coral sunroom of her home on Embassy Row.

“Elizabeth, welcome,” Clinton says, smiling stiffly. “I was worried that you were lost since it was taking you so-o-o-o long to finally get here.”

“Hahaha,” Warren replies. “I’ve always heard you’re a hoot in private. I know I was the last Democratic woman in the Senate to endorse you but Bernie and I have more in common. We don’t buckrake on Wall Street. People are enthusiastic about us and believe what we say. We’re pure.”

“Pure scolds,” Hillary sniffs. “I guess it hit you, when you saw me fighting for my life against a dyspeptic 74-year-old socialist with one suit, that if you had jumped in, you could have been the first woman president.”

“Yes,” Warren muses. “I only loaned Bernie my progressive hordes. I’m the real leader of that movement.”

“Not anymore,” Hillary says.

Warren sighs. “True, my faithful are peeved at me for not running and for endorsing you instead of Bernie.”

Hillary pours herself some coffee. “I know you’re intrigued by the idea of being my vice president,” she says. “I heard you tell our gal Rachel Maddow that you’re prepared to be commander in chief. But you know I can’t put you on the ticket, don’t you?”

“Because the country isn’t ready for two wonky women for the price of one?” Warren asks dryly.

“No,” Hillary says, biting her biscotti, “I’m not ready. You, the so-called Sheriff of Wall Street, attacked me as the Shill of Wall Street. Why should you get the glass slipper when you were foot-dragging on my glass-shattering moment?”

Warren protests, “I went up against that loud, nasty, thin-skinned, mud-flinging, money-grubbing, racist, sexist, reckless, pathetic loser Trump. You were flailing around, not knowing how to take on that repugnant bully until I showed you the way on Twitter.”

“Yeah,” Hillary says sarcastically, “you’re a big help on Twitter. Trump is tweeting out video from 2004 where you’re trashing me as ‘the scary part about democracy’ for taking campaign donations from the banking industry and then voting for an anti-consumer bankruptcy bill that would have helped the credit card companies.”

Warren smiles primly, sipping her Pellegrino. “Speaking of credit, you have to give me some for this: In my last book, I left out the stuff I had in my previous one about you being an unprincipled sellout. By 2014, when that one came out, it looked like you were going to go the distance. My purity sometimes gives way to expediency.

“You know all the Democrats want me on the ticket to add some sizzle since the crowds you draw wouldn’t even fill this couch. I know you are afraid I will overshadow you and I will. But I can help you reel in all the young women who find you more shifty than nifty. And the Bernie Bros dig me.”

“Thanks, Pocahontas,” Hillary replies, looking steely. “I can do some things on my own. I did manage to secure a spot in the Ivy League without pretending to be Native American. I hope you noticed that I’ve decorated my house in all the colors of the wind.”

Warren bristles, Church Lady-style: “You have done a fine job here, except that one painting looks crooked, Hillary. I’m surprised you don’t have oil portraits of Goldman and Sachs. And let me give you some free advice: Now that Bernie and I have forced you to address income inequality, you might want to hide that $12,495 tweed Armani jacket you wore on the trail in the back of your closet.”

The senator from Massachusetts stands up. “Where’s the bathroom?” she asks. “Can I squeeze in there with the server?”

Hillary gives that big laugh that indicates she is not amused. “No need to go on the warpath,” she says in her best Cersei manner. “Let’s bury the hatchet — in The Donald.”

Warren exhales and sits back down: “You’re right. The sisterhood has to be united in supporting the first woman leading a major ticket against the worst misogynist leading a major ticket. Can you believe Trump said he broke the glass ceiling by promoting women in construction? The only glass he knows is the mirror. And the thrice-married huckster had the nerve to tell evangelicals here Friday that marriage and family are the building blocks for success. That dog gets my blood boiling!

“He calls me Goofy? Picture America under this Mad Man. He’d want us gussied up in gingham aprons, baking casseroles. Remember that horrible crack he made about Ivana? ‘I think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing,’ he said. ‘The softness disappeared.’ I’ll show him softness disappearing. He also said, ‘When I come home and dinner’s not ready, I go through the roof.’ A Trump Supreme Court would take away abortion rights and bring back those hideous vaginal probes. Hillary, think about it — they might even outlaw pantsuits. That tyrant would drag women away from their desks and exile them to the kitchen and the nursery.”

Hillary nods rhythmically: “Trump’s the one who belongs in the nursery. He’s so needy, he even needs to talk to those scorpions in the press.”

Warren agrees, “That’s the craziest thing he does. Nuts.”

NOT long ago I wrote an essay on how to talk about environmental issues with conservatives. Talk persuasively, that is, not confrontationally. A conservative promptly replied that I was afflicted with “fundamental ignorance,” and possibly worse. The gist of it was that conservatives are already environmentalists, and the rest of us are just too stupid to recognize it. I put on my cheerfully positive face and suggested that he amplify his point by listing 10 pro-environment actions by conservatives in this century. (O.K., maybe that was my passive-aggressive face, given that George W. Bush was president for eight of those 16 years.) He replied with more name-calling.

This is a shame, because conservatives used to be almost by definition conservationists, focused on preserving our shared heritage from destructive influences. You can, in fact, date the rise of the conservation movement as a political force in this country to a December 1887 dinner party of wealthy big game hunters, largely Republicans, hosted in a Madison Avenue house by Theodore Roosevelt (still a hero to many modern conservatives, despite certain progressive leanings). He and his guests that night formed the Boone and Crockett Club, dedicated to preservation and management of game.

Putting to work their considerable social and political clout, as well as their money, they went on to save the bison from extinction, greatly expand the national park system, and help establish both the National Wildlife Refuge System and the United States Forest Service. The Lacey Act, still our most important law against wildlife crime, was largely their doing. Ducks Unlimited, a Boone and Crockett offshoot, became an early force for wetland conservation.

This natural link between conservatives and conservation lasted through much of the 20th century. Conservatives may complain about oil companies being shut out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but most of the credit for protecting that habitat belongs to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who also signed the nation’s first air pollution control law. Richard M. Nixon, not otherwise a candidate for sainthood, changed the way the nation lives, breathes and does business, establishing the Environmental Protection Agency and enacting the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, among other major environmental initiatives. George H. W. Bush, finally, began to take conservation in a new market-based direction, pushing through a cap-and-trade system in 1990 that enabled industry to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, which causes acid rain, far more quickly and cheaply than anyone imagined possible.

So what does it take to bring conservatives back, after a quarter-century of their reflexively treating even the mention of environmental issues as a treasonous attack on business and the nation? It’s possible they are already returning, with the House of Representatives last month approving a major environmental reform by an astonishingly bipartisan 403 to 12 margin, and the Senate almost certain to follow.

Among that legislation’s sponsors are the unlikely Senate partners Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana. It repairs and strengthens the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, and belatedly enhances the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to test the safety of chemicals being developed and manufactured every year. Industry came to the table because a single federal regulatory standard seemed preferable to state-by-state regulation. The rest was old-fashioned give-and-take, with each side resisting the urge to fling bombs at the other, and both swallowing aspects of the law they didn’t like for the common good. It was a product, that is, of what we used to call democracy.

It’s also arguably a model for further cooperation on environmental issues. But how to make progress on other vital environmental issues? It will help for environmentalists to acknowledge past contributions by conservatives and also the potential value of conservative approaches for the future.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2317,"Mr. Villasana Hernaez, 39, said he was always attracted by the farmland and planted an orchard as a youngster next to his family’s holiday home.

Five years ago, after his mother died, he made a more radical lifestyle change and walked away from the family-owned driving school where he had taught.

He decided to start “growing things that others didn’t.” For the first two years, he sold as many as 20 varieties of pumpkins and other produce at specialty food markets and local fairs, until a friend put him in touch with Mr. Alija, who offered him a chance to break through as a top restaurant supplier.

Today, Mr. Villasana Hernaez estimated that he is among a dozen producers of tear peas around the Basque Country.

“Gastronomy has brought back value to a type of ecological agriculture that was being lost, and it is encouraging more young people to become farmers and make nature their work office,” he said.

Mr. Villasana Hernaez sows his peas in January and harvests them about four months later. He also grows about 30 other vegetables or herbs for Mr. Alija, from the autochthonous to the exotic.

In addition to the peas, he harvests “baby” versions of other vegetables, including undersized pumpkins, carrots, and six varieties of eggplants, originally from countries like Turkey, Italy and Japan. His herbs include huauzontle from Mexico and jambu, also called toothache plant, from Brazil.

The tear pea is expensive because of its unpredictable and short harvest, the intensive labor it requires, and the need to transport it quickly from the orchard to the kitchen.

During the spring harvest, Mr. Villasana Hernaez picks the peas early in the morning to avoid exposing them to strong sunlight. Then he drives 20 minutes from his hillside greenhouse to Nerua’s kitchen in Bilbao, where eight of Mr. Alija’s assistants spend about 45 minutes delicately shelling them.

Photo

This is followed by a second selection process, as some misshaped or larger peas get discarded or are turned into a fried appetizer dish. The peas are cooked only for seconds, using one of three different techniques, depending on what Mr. Alija is preparing.

The tear pea’s skin is thin and fibrous, requiring it to be handled delicately. But it is also what helps create the sensation of an “explosion” in the mouth when the skin is burst and the sap and sugars are released.

Despite its sweetness, the pea also has a slightly salty taste, which Mr. Alija attributes to the sea winds that sweep across the coastal farmland of the Basque Country. The tear pea is tasty even raw, but gains flavor when it is slightly steamed or grilled because the smoke adds “a spicy touch,” Mr. Alija said.

Last year, he combined the peas with egg yolk and vanilla, and this spring he served them with an olive oil ice cream and grapes. For 2017, Mr. Alija is planning to add Swiss chard juice and chili pepper to the peas.

However the tear peas are served, “it is all in the moment,” Mr. Alija said.

“Two days of keeping means losing 60 percent of its quality,” he added, unlike truffles and other gourmet produce that keep longer and travel more easily.

In fact, the sugar of the tear pea begins to transform so quickly into starch right after it is picked that it would be challenging to deliver unaltered even to Madrid, about 250 miles away, according to Mr. Villasana Hernaez.

Mr. Roca, the chef of El Celler, said he discovered the tear pea in the Basque Country, and persuaded his local Catalan producer to start growing his own version, which “is a bit different, but has the same taste and gives the same sensation.”

“The development of this pea is a fantastic example of the dialogue and relationship between the chef and the local producer,” Mr. Roca said. “Even if you can’t expect people on the street to pay such a high price for peas, I think gastronomy is the springboard to show just what our orchard can yield.”

In turn, he added, being able to produce something special like tear peas “brings prestige to a farming region, which will trickle back down to ordinary consumers.”

Not every Spanish chef, however, is as enthralled.

“Everybody suddenly seems to be using the tear pea, but I think it’s a bit of a fashion,” said Óscar Velasco, who runs Santceloni, a restaurant in Madrid that has been awarded two Michelin stars. “For me, the texture of the tear pea somewhat lacks crunchiness because it is just too small.”

Instead, Mr. Velasco uses a sweeter and larger pea grown in Maresme, in Catalonia.

Even if all his colleagues have not been won over by his favorite pea, Mr. Alija seems to value the tear pea as much for how it bonds him to Mr. Villasana Hernaez, his fellow Basque and farmer, as for its flavor.

“The essence and soul of high gastronomy is in the local,” he said.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2318,"The government has said little about the marine die-off while cracking down on the protests, which have been called every Sunday since May 1, when thousands of people took to the streets of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and other cities. More than 500 people have been arrested, and demonstrators have been beaten by the police.

“The response by the government has been one of ineptitude,” said Carlyle Thayer, a Vietnam analyst at the Australian Defense Force Academy. He said the fish kill was the most serious environmental issue to confront the government in several years and reflected poorly on the government of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who took office in April.

Last month, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the government to avoid excessive use of force, citing “increasing levels of violence” against the protesters.

But the protests have continued.

On Sunday, more than 1,000 people turned out in a coastal district of Nghe An Province, north of the steel plant, to demonstrate. Many wore T-shirts bearing a fish skeleton. Some carried signs reading, “Fish need clean water, citizens need transparency.”

“It seems the government tries to cover up for the culprit,” the Rev. Anthony Nam, a Catholic priest and protest leader in Nghe An, said by telephone. “We will protest until the government says what caused the spill.”

In Nhan Trach, about 40 miles south of the steel factory, the dead and dying fish first appeared in early April, floating in the surf and washing up on the beach. Initially, it seemed like a windfall, and many people here ate and sold them. The fish kept coming, tons of them, day after day for more than a month, residents said.

“Some of the fish were dead; some were dying,” said Ho Huu Sia, 67, who buys and dries fish for a living. “We ate the fish that were still alive. We ate the fish for two weeks.”

His daughter, Ho Thi Dao, 32, said she became ill, experiencing vomiting, diarrhea and dizziness. She went to the local clinic and received intravenous fluids. She said she met others there who also suffered poisoning.

Belatedly, the government announced that aquatic life had been poisoned along the coastline of four provinces. The authorities warned people not to eat fish and ordered a halt to fishing.

As compensation, officials distributed bags of rice and gave fishermen 50,000 dong, or about $2.20.

“We are just sitting with tears running down our cheeks looking out at the ocean,” said Ms. Phi, who has been fishing from Nhan Trach all her life. “What can we do with 50,000 dong?”

Coastal residents and journalists quickly accused the Formosa Ha Tinh Steel plant, which opened in December, of being the culprit.

According to news reports, the fish kill happened after the factory washed unspecified cleaning chemicals through its wastewater pipeline. A company representative seemed to confirm the suspicions in April when he said it would not be surprising if the factory’s wastewater harmed marine life.

“You have to decide whether to catch fish and shrimp or to build a modern steel industry,” he told reporters. “Even if you are the prime minister, you cannot choose both.”

His comments incited a flurry of criticism on social media and spawned a popular hashtag on social media, #ichoosefish.

The company later argued that it met Vietnam’s environmental standards and said that the spokesman had been fired.

Company officials did not respond to requests for comment.

The government has been just as reticent.

At first, it suggested a toxic algae bloom was responsible. In mid-May, Pham Cong Tac, deputy science and technology minister, told Vietnamese news outlets that the ministry had a “convincing scientific basis” to explain the fish deaths, but he did not disclose what it was.

Last week, Mai Tien Dung, minister and head of the government office, said that the authorities had identified the cause but indicated that they could not tell the public because an investigation was continuing.

The lack of information has only fueled the protesters’ anger.

Villagers say the authorities collected water samples immediately after the episode, and foreign experts say test results should have been known within days.

Nguyen Hoang Anh, a university professor in Hanoi, said the government should have immediately revealed the toxin, especially to the poisoning victims and their doctors.

“It’s not fair,” she said. “It’s not ethical. It’s a crime.”

She said the cover-up had the potential to make the fish kill Vietnam’s Chernobyl, the 1986 nuclear disaster that contributed to the unraveling of the Soviet Union.

That is what the government most fears, analysts say, and it is why it acts quickly and at times brutally to suppress protests before they ignite a popular uprising.

But critics say the government has another motive. The government has supported the steel plant, giving the company a sweetheart deal, including tax incentives and a bargain price for the property, to build on the coast.

Two years ago, while the factory was under construction, it became a prime target of the riots over China’s placement of an oil rig in waters off Vietnam in the South China Sea. More than 200 factories owned by Chinese and other foreign companies were looted and set ablaze around the country.

But the worst rioting occurred at Formosa, where four people were killed. The company is based in Taiwan, but thousands of laborers from mainland China were building the factory. Protesters stopped buses, pulled off Chinese passengers and beat them.

The authorities have been more careful not to let the current protests get out of hand. But even if they can be quelled, the economic costs have continued to mount.

On a recent morning, more than a dozen fish traders gathered at a drink shop across from the beach here. A few played board games. There was nothing to do but kill time, one said.

Around the corner, Phan Dinh Son, 49, sat in his all-too-quiet open-air shop. He used to sell hundreds of blocks of ice a day. Now he sells about 20, he said. A separate business buying and trading shellfish has been suspended because no one wants to eat local fish.

“The fish market is empty,” he said. “I would hope the government and the party would come up with a solution and give a clear answer so we can do our business.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html

2322,"UBER RECEIVES $3.5 BILLION FROM SAUDI ARABIA | Uber has turned to the Middle East in its quest to build a global empire. It raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund in one of the largest ever investments into a privately held start-up,

Mike Isaac and Michael J. de la Merced report in The New York Times. This round of fund-raising continued to value the company at $62.5 billion. Uber said the investment aligned the company with Saudi Arabia’s plans to transform its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. It came together after David Plouffe, an Uber board member, traveled to the Middle East in March and was invited to the Saudi fund for a briefing. Uber, Silicon Valley’s most valuable private business, has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash every six months or so. It has been spending furiously to expand and defend its territory, particularly in China, where it is in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up. Uber said it planned to invest $250 million in The Middle East where it has rolled out its service in 15 cities across nine countries.

It also said its service may be a boon for Saudi Arabia, where women are not allowed to drive because of religious edicts. “Of course we think women should be allowed to drive,” said Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman. “In the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn’t exist before — and we’re incredibly proud of that.” The company said about 80 percent of its riders were women. Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud sits on Uber’s public policy advisory board and has worked with it to usher the service into the country.

Saudi Arabia was not known for venture capital investing, but some members of the royal family have been involved in deals. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has invested in Lyft, a competitor of Uber. Investing in an American company like Uber, however, could run counter to Saudi Arabia’s threat to sell off investments in the United States, which was issued during discussion about a bill in Congress that would allow the kingdom to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Saudi Arabia had just two advisers on the deal: JPMorgan Chase on the financial side and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom on the legal side. The deal is unlikely to yield a huge payday for these companies, but it lends them bragging rights and could put them in line for advisory positions down the line, Michael J. de la Merced reports in DealBook. JPMorgan is already helping advise the kingdom in its initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.

PAYDAY LOAN INDUSTRY COULD SOON BE GUTTED | New rules that federal regulators plan to announce on Thursday could severely restrict the payday loan industry, which has been vilified for the exorbitant interest rates it charges on short-term loans,

Stacy Cowley reports in DealBook. People who borrow money against their paychecks are generally supposed to pay it back within two weeks, with substantial fees piled on, but as most borrowers roll loans over into new ones, they become steadily less less likely to emerge from the debt. Mainstream banks are generally barred from this kind of lending and more than a dozen states have their own rules prohibiting payday loans. The new guidelines from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will require lenders in many cases to verify their customers’ income and confirm that they can afford to repay the money they borrow. The number of times that people could roll over their loans into newer — and more expensive — ones would be curtailed. The new rules do not need congressional approval and could take effect as soon as next year. “The very economics of the payday lending business model depend on a substantial percentage of borrowers being unable to repay the loan and borrowing again and again at high interest rates,” said Richard Cordray, the director of the bureau. “It is much like getting into a taxi just to ride across town and finding yourself stuck in a ruinously expensive cross-country journey.” Dennis Shaul, the chief executive of the Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group for payday lenders, responded by saying that vulnerable borrowers would be cut off from a financial lifeline. “Thousands of lenders, especially small businesses, will be forced to shutter their doors, lay off employees, and leave communities that already have too few options for financial services,” he said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that loan volume could fall by at least 55 percent. An economic study paid for by the trade association also estimated that the $37,000 annual profit generated by the average storefront lender would instead become a $28,000 loss. Some consumer advocates say the rules still do not go far enough. “This misses the mark,” said Nick Bourke, a research director at the Pew Charitable Trusts, which has conducted extensive research on small-dollar lending. “The C.F.P.B. is proposing an underwriting process, which is helpful, but clearer product safety standards are needed.”

2323,"“Turn off the 4 and 5,” Munchkin told the dealer. “And give me a max bet on the high/low.” He wanted to remove wagers on 4 and 5, because those numbers would be hurt by the likely absence of 2 and 3 this hand; the high/low, however — a gamble that two aces (1s) or two 6s would come up and pay off at 30 to 1 in each case — now had a higher probability of arriving.

That’s how it went throughout the evening. Munchkin was less than friendly, tipped modestly, demanded a lot of service. One dealer, rankled by the light gratuities, bluntly said to him, “We need to make some money tonight.”

Another, seemingly out of friendliness but probably trolling for information, asked Munchkin’s name. “I’d rather not say,” Munchkin replied.

“Come on,” the dealer said. “We need to call you something.”

“O.K. Little Joe. Call me Little Joe.”

Despite Grosjean’s signals, Munchkin went on a bad streak, losing more than $8,000. At one point, when he pulled yet more cash from his money belt, another player at the table said, “I think Little Joe’s printing $100 bills in his pants.”

A barrel-chested pit boss piled on: “Looks like Little Joe’s gonna be going home by bus tonight.” He would, in other words, end up losing his car.

Grosjean was frustrated. His signaling had not been perfected yet — some gestures were being missed. That, combined with a bit of bad luck, had put Munchkin into a difficult situation. Their scheme, their play against the casino, was perhaps too complicated to pull off, Grosjean would later concede. Still, he kept feeding Munchkin information about the cards.

Slowly, as the night grinded on, some of the high-returning prop bets started to pay off. Signaled that ace, 2 and 4 all had a high likelihood of exclusion before one turn of the cards, Munchkin threw a $100 chip across the felt and said, “One hundred, Yo!” which was a bet that the next two cards would add up to 11.

When they came up, Munchkin shot a fist in the air and shouted. The wager paid 15-to-1, for a quick $1,500.

The thrill was feigned. An observant dealer, a man who appeared to be in his early 30s, discerned something fishy. Maybe he had noticed the discreet glances at Grosjean. Or perhaps it was something about Munchkin’s overall demeanor. But after Little Joe hit a second Yo prop bet, the dealer looked up toward the ceiling, possibly hoping to catch the eye of someone monitoring a surveillance camera, and said in a singsong, “Card counter.”

Glances were exchanged among employees running the game, but no one else seemed to take the claim very seriously — nor did they realize that something potentially more profitable and innovative than card counting was going on. After all, Little Joe was bleeding money.

Grosjean and Munchkin were undaunted by their losses — roughly $7,000 on this weekend-long trip. That’s part of perfecting a play and part of life as an advantage player. On a previous trip, with another team, I watched losses reach $40,000 over a weekend; conditions were good but luck ran cold. At the Grand itself, years earlier, playing a previous incarnation of this very game, Grosjean says his confederates were down $60,000 before netting $90,000. The best and most important outcome from tonight’s experience, Grosjean would tell me with relief several days later, was that the dealers failed to associate him with Little Joe. He learned as much when he spent the next two days gambling on his own. Betting $5 chips and signaling into the air, Grosjean aroused no suspicions. He could come back any time and plug a fresh partner into Munchkin’s place to do the big betting. “I think this game can be worth $150,000 before they shut me down,” Grosjean told me.

A month later, I met with a woman notorious for having won more than $20 million from casinos in less than five years. Her name was Cheung Yin Sun. Elite Western gamblers and rattled casino bosses know her as Kelly, a fast-talking, sunglasses-wearing advantage player in her 40s. Her father, now deceased, was a wealthy factory owner based in Hong Kong. She says she lost $20 million of his money playing baccarat and slot machines. She claims to be unbothered by having blown a fortune in gambling dens around the world. In fact, she all but brags about her losses.

But when Sun was arrested in 2007 for a $93,000 gambling debt owed to MGM, she vowed revenge. “I was in jail for three weeks,” she told me. We were sitting in a back booth in the coffee shop of SLS Las Vegas, a stylish casino on the north end of the Strip. Sun wore a neon green approximation of a tennis dress. “Women attacked me, and the guards wouldn’t let me wear my own underwear. I lost 25 pounds in jail and didn’t get out until a relative flew here with $100,000 for the casino. I decided that one day I would get back the money by playing at MGM properties.”

Upon her release, Sun visited several Las Vegas casino gift shops and bought souvenir decks of playing cards. They look identical to those used at the gaming tables but have holes punched through their centers to prevent cheaters from slipping a souvenir ace of spades, say, into a poker game. Sun had no such intention. She scrutinized the backs of the cards. Some had crisscrossing patterns that went right to all four edges. The patterns on these cards, as a consequence of the manufacturing processes, were trimmed slightly differently on top and bottom, resulting in uneven margins of 1/32 of an inch or less. She spent around a thousand hours, over four years, training herself to recognize the minute variations on particular cards. Sun figured out how she could leverage these differences that were almost imperceptible and acceptable by industry standards. She wasn’t the first to recognize this vulnerability and capitalize on it. But she expanded on the strategy of exploiting unmatched trims, a ploy that has long been known as “edge sorting.” Sun applied it to a baccarat spinoff called mini-baccarat and earned herself a nickname, the Queen of Sorts.

Mini-baccarat is played with eight decks of cards. To begin, four cards are dealt face down onto the table. Two are for the banker’s hand and two are for a player. Patrons never touch the cards. Before the cards are dealt, gamblers bet on banker or player (or a tie). Whichever side gets closer to 9 is the winner. Tens and picture-cards count as zero; aces count as 1. If the sum exceeds 9, then only the second digit is recognized (for example, a 9 and 6 add up to 15 but count as 5). Based on the opening sum, one additional card may be drawn for each hand, but, for Sun’s purposes, it would be the first four cards that really mattered.

From her years as a losing high-stakes gambler, she knew that casino executives will accommodate even outlandish requests from customers who wager huge sums of money. She also believed that Asian gamblers were viewed as superstitious.

In October 2011, having trained herself to edge-sort, Sun decided to exploit both the servility and the stereotype. She had a Chinese partner from Los Angeles deposit $100,000 with Aria Resort and Casino, a high-end property in Las Vegas owned by MGM and Dubai World. On the appointed day of their play, Sun’s partner entered Aria accompanied by what seemed to be a retinue of friends: another man, a woman and Sun. At a reserved table, they played mini-baccarat straightforwardly, as typical high-stakes gamblers might. They lost the entire $100,000.

A day later, they returned to the casino and deposited $500,000. But they had a request: to be allowed to make their bets after the four cards used in each mini-baccarat hand were dealt. Sun described this as “Macau style.” They also wanted a dealer who spoke Mandarin and Cantonese. Casino representatives approved the requests. On that second day, Sun pulled a rolling Louis Vuitton suitcase behind her.

Once play began, they instructed the dealer to turn certain cards half a rotation. The man, claiming to be superstitious, insisted that this was “for good luck.” The dealer complied; nobody wanted to rattle the money-leaking players by refusing them. Luck, of course, had nothing to do with their request. Sun and her team needed the turns so that mini-baccarat’s most important cards — 7s, 8s and 9s, which often determine which hand wins — all had the short trims facing away from them. “I didn’t care that we dropped $100,000 the day before,” Sun says. “I knew that we couldn’t lose.”

The next time through the dealing shoe, now that the key cards with short trims had been set up properly, they went on a long winning streak. As the casino’s racks of $5,000 and $25,000 chips were being depleted and refilled, phones rang in the gaming pit. Edgy casino personnel crowded the table. Sun recalls six men in suits watching her intensely.

When a partner failed to bet quickly enough, she grabbed his chips and made the wager herself. Sun wanted to get through the eight-deck stack of 416 cards before Aria personnel could recognize what was going on. To ease her nerves, she says she rubbed a finger along the outline of a freshly inked jaguar tattoo on her right thigh. “I went to Maui and got it for good luck,” she told me later. “Jaguars are the most powerful animals in the jungle.”

After 40 minutes, though, with three decks remaining to be dealt, she feared that their play would be discovered and “that they wouldn’t let me cash my chips.” Sun ended the game prematurely — but ahead by $1.1 million. At the cashier’s cage, she pressed the casino employees, whose hands she says were trembling, to hurry and convert the chips to dollars. Few gamblers take such substantial sums in cash, usually preferring a check instead.

Sun and her team disappeared into the Las Vegas dusk with their winnings in the suitcase. According to a surveillance officer who witnessed the play, Aria employees spent two days piecing together what had happened. They later dubbed the incident the “Million Dollar Shoe,” referring to the plastic, rectangular container from which the decks of cards are dealt. “It was great to see something like that,” the surveillance officer told me. “I’ll probably never see it again, and that education cost Aria only a million dollars.”

Over the coming week, Sun and her highly organized group used the same strategy to beat more Las Vegas casinos, including Treasure Island and Caesars Palace. They made a trip to Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Conn. Eventually Sun recruited the celebrity poker pro Phil Ivey, who is also known as a high-stakes gambler at craps and baccarat.

During the next year, he wired seven-figure sums to various casinos and did the betting. Sun did the edge-sorting of the cards and tipped off Ivey whether to wager on banker or player. Their combined winnings in Atlantic City, London and other places were in the eight figures. Over the course of four sessions of gambling at private tables at Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City alone, the pair won $9.6 million.

A couple weeks ago, I spoke to Sun on the phone. She told me she was in Macau, presumably beating baccarat games there. But her success has exacted a price. She is currently linked to three lawsuits with casinos that insist she used deceptive practices. Ivey is appealing a case in London against a casino that withheld their winnings. A similar dispute (not involving Ivey) with Foxwoods is also under appeal. The Borgata case is in a pretrial phase: The casino accuses her and Ivey of cheating and seeks to recoup $9.6 million; their lawyers maintain that what they did was perfectly legal.

Ted Whiting, who works for MGM, one of the owners of Aria, will not comment on her. As for edge-sorting at mini-baccarat, he says, “It is not against the law in Nevada, and I do not consider it cheating.” He adds that the casino is planning to soon start using software that makes various advantage plays more difficult to pull off.

When I last saw Grosjean in action, he had returned to Shawnee and was passing himself off as A.J. “In my mind,” he said, “it stands for Ace, Jack.” He had done some more computer programming and come up with a simpler, less volatile system. “Part of the problem with the Munchkin approach was that we would have small losses that nobody noticed and big wins that everybody noticed,” Grosjean said. “It’s the exact opposite of what you want to do.”

Grosjean would try out his refined approach with his longtime partner Bobby Sanchez. Big-boned and sporting a freshly trimmed businessman’s haircut, Sanchez acted friendly and, when asked, let casino personnel know that he was in the midst of opening a legal-services business in Oklahoma City. The cover story explained why a newcomer would suddenly show up and spend multiple nights in an out-of-the-way casino, gambling more money than anyone else in the place.

Sanchez bet aggressively, tipped generously and never missed a signal. “The first seven or eight sessions went smoothly,” he says. “Dealers there loved me, they bought my story, and I had big wins as well as a significant loss. One night I dropped $30,000 and acted like I didn’t care.” The play ended on a night when Sanchez was ahead $9,000 and a supervisor stepped up to the table and requested his ID. “I asked him if he was joking and made another bet,” Sanchez told me. “The guy apologized and said that he wasn’t. I kept playing as if I didn’t believe him. Then he told me that if I don’t show ID, I can’t continue to play. I told him I’d think about it.”

But no thinking was required. Before tips, they had made $100,000. That night he told his partners: “I guess I’m done with Oklahoma. Time to move East.”

Grosjean told me recently that he has been finding profitable situations throughout the United States, though he won’t say where. Meanwhile, the card-craps table in Shawnee continues to simmer. The casino has taken several procedural measures, like extra shuffling by hand, that makes its craps iteration more difficult to beat. Grosjean acknowledges that it won’t be as profitable as it once was, but he still intends to go back and beat it one day. “Some people think of all these games as an unlimited resource,” he says. “I view them more like oil wells. If you have a well producing a billion barrels and another one producing only 50 million, you still pump the smaller well because eventually the big one will run out of oil. So if a game is still dumping out money, we’ll keep on playing it. I’m fine with winning a few thousand dollars over the course of a weekend.”

Plus, he adds, there would be something satisfying about extracting money from the third version of this game. “A hat trick!” he says. “That would be really great.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2324,"“It is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic,” said Guy Moszkowski, a longtime securities analyst at Autonomous Research.

By any measure, Mr. Thiam is an unconventional choice to lead an investment bank. Born to a prominent family in Ivory Coast, he cut short a career at McKinsey & Company in Paris in 1994 to join a reform-minded government in his home country as a top banker and minister.

Following a military coup in 1999, Mr. Thiam returned to McKinsey, and in 2009, he was named chief executive of Prudential, the British insurance conglomerate — becoming the first African to head a major listed company in Britain.

Six-foot-four and snugly tailored, Mr. Thiam has an air about him of not suffering fools. He had a successful run at Prudential (no relation to an American company with a similar name), overcoming an uproar following a failed bid to buy the Asian operations of the American International Group. Along the way, he became one of London’s more celebrated executives and a regular on the circuit of global get-togethers.

That he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses should not come as a surprise. “There needs to be a cultural change,” he said in a televised interview in March, in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay. “A lot of the problems in the investment bank are that people are trying to generate revenue at all costs.”

In turn, deal makers in London and New York, who have seen their bonuses slashed by nearly 40 percent, are not hiding their dislike of the man.

More than any other bank on Wall Street, Credit Suisse restricts the cash portion of its bonuses, allocating large chunks in company stock, which has halved in value. So when their new chief executive gave a speech in May and said that Credit Suisse’s stock price “reflected reality,” bankers, especially the many who have worked at the firm for decades, could not believe it.

On Credit Suisse’s newly renovated trading floor in New York, several bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, grumbled that Mr. Thiam had “lost the building,” which is Wall Street parlance for chief executives who no longer command the respect of their traders. And when he has appeared on television in recent months, employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen, according those bankers, who witnessed the events but were not authorized to speak publicly.

Mr. Thiam was hailed during his first visit to the trading floor in New York last year, but the reception during a more recent appearance was chillier, said two employees who were on the floor during his visits but were not authorized to speak publicly. In particular, many at Credit Suisse find Mr. Thiam’s personal style to be jarring at a time when thousands are being laid off and the stock is trading at a multiyear low.

This is particularly true when compared with Brady W. Dougan, his low-key predecessor: Mr. Thiam’s own dealings with the media are handled by a British firm, Powerscourt. He enjoys a robust social life and has been seen doing the rounds at clubs in London and Davos, Switzerland. And he recently purchased a luxury home in Herrliberg, an exclusive lakeside enclave in Zurich.

To be sure, analysts agree that Credit Suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives with firms like Deutsche Bank as a profit center. Instead, Mr. Thiam is encouraging his deal makers to support the firm’s private bankers in Asia, by providing loans to palm-oil magnates in Indonesia or helping billionaire clients in China with initial public offerings.

Mr. Thiam is clearly enamored with the prospect of tapping growth markets in emerging economies. He has been to China and broader Asia at least four times in his new capacity, and his business cards carry a Mandarin translation on the back.

Mr. Thiam’s defenders say that with the future of Credit Suisse in doubt, he has no choice but to make these painful changes and that resistance from well-compensated traders and bankers should not deter him. And it is also true that wealth managers in Switzerland and Asia, where Mr. Thiam is adding resources, are embracing the new strategy.

To date, the Credit Suisse board appears to be standing with Mr. Thiam. Indeed, having had two Wall Street chiefs since 2001, the board clearly believes that only a prominent nonbanker like Mr. Thiam can wean the firm off a line of business that has so long defined it.

Nevertheless, directors were not happy with his televised comments in March when Mr. Thiam suggested that traders at the bank were hiding losses from him. Mr. Thiam quickly corrected himself at a conference that same day and said no limits were breached, though not without taking another dig at his traders by questioning their judgment. Mr. Thiam also called these distressed-debt traders and offered what a spokeswoman for the bank said was a “clarification” of his remarks.

“The board is 100 percent behind the strategy, Tidjane and the executive board,” said Richard E. Thornburgh, a former Credit Suisse banker with 30 years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the board’s risk committee.

With morale in New York at a low point, Mr. Thornburgh has had recent meetings with top bankers and traders, hearing them out and urging them to remain focused on their clients. For many, though, this is easier said than done. It is unusual, after all, for an incoming chief executive to be so publicly critical of employees responsible for a quarter of a firm’s revenue.

That is particularly true on Wall Street, where punctured vanities can quickly harm a firm, as productive bankers head for the exits in droves. Over the last six months, at least 18 bankers and traders have left the firm, with many of these coming from Credit Suisse’s once prestigious technology unit in San Francisco.

The culture clash at Credit Suisse recalls a similar dispute at Morgan Stanley a decade ago. Like Mr. Thiam, Philip J. Purcell was a former whiz kid consultant from McKinsey who preferred slow and steady brokers over bankers with big egos and even bigger paychecks. A banker-led uprising forced Mr. Purcell’s departure, since power on Wall Street was then still in the hands of deal makers and traders.

With wealth managers now ascendant, Mr. Thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his own bankers as a painful necessity if his grand plan is to succeed. “Is there a vision. Is there a direction?” Mr. Thiam asked aloud last year in a speech introducing his strategy. “The Germans say that the horrible end is better than horror without end.”","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2325,"THE UNSPOKEN REASON BEHIND THE LINKEDIN SALE | Microsoft’s $26.2 billion cash deal to buy LinkedIn was by far the largest in its history, and its biggest bet on a shift from traditional software toward cloud computing, Nick Wingfield reports in DealBook.

The chief of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, has already improved his company’s image by opening up to partnerships with once-bitter rivals like Salesforce, and he has accelerated the company’s shift to cloud services. LinkedIn also caters to professionals, opening up the possibility of linking its network with Microsoft tools, and Microsoft is paying less than it would have done last fall when shares were trading at more than $260 a share. They closed at $131.08 on Friday.

Still, the value of the deal harks back to the heady heights of yesteryear’s technology valuations, Michael J. de la Merced and Leslie Picker report in DealBook. It gives LinkedIn an enterprise value at 79 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the 12 months that ended on March 31. By that measure, the transaction is more expensive than any big internet deal paid with cash, according to Bloomberg data.

Microsoft is paying $220 for each of LinkedIn’s monthly users, compared with the $40 Facebook paid for each WhatsApp user two years ago. “Microsoft just paid on the assumption that we’re going back to the multiples we had a year ago, but I don’t think that’s happening,” said Max Wolff, the chief economist at Manhattan Venture partners.

LinkedIn will operate as an independent brand, in the same way as WhatsApp did after being acquired by Facebook. Jeff Weiner will continue as chief executive.

The attractions of the deal for LinkedIn are clear, in light of the struggling stock price. But the company is also heavily reliant on stock-based compensation, an issue that Mr. Weiner did not mention on Monday, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.

LinkedIn employees are paid largely in stock, and its shares plummeted more than 40 percent in February after a weaker-than-expected growth forecast. There have been persistent whispers about whether LinkedIn could retain its top talent as the marketplace clobbered their incomes, Mr. Sorkin writes.

However the company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation from its earnings, turning losses into gains. Stock-based compensation represented 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mark Mahaney, a longtime technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue. LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which “have the most dependence on stock-based compensation,” also had results “of lower quality,” Mr. Mahaney said.

LinkedIn has justified the practice by saying that stock-based compensation “is noncash in nature” and that excluding it provides “meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.” But investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical. And Facebook, which used to do the same, changed its policy in April, saying that stock-based compensation played an important role in how it paid its employees and was therefore a “real expense for the business.”

It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn would soon have had to use a more realistic version of its earnings and report more losses. Microsoft said that the combined company would follow Microsoft’s practice of including stock-based compensation in earnings calculations.

As it was, LinkedIn’s decision to sell suggested that the stand-alone outlook was not especially alluring, Robert Cyran writes in Breakingviews. And there are questions on Microsoft’s side, too, Mr. Cyran writes. It had to write down the $9.5 billion it paid for Nokia and the $6.3 billion it paid for the aQuantive digital advertising agency.

These were deals sealed by Mr. Nadella’s predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer, but it is hard to make these transactions pay off. Concrete indications of the deal’s financial benefits are in worryingly short supply, Mr. Cyran notes.

There will be a windfall for the companies’ advisers, though, Mr. de la Merced writes in DealBook.

Microsoft drew on two traditional advisers, Morgan Stanley, one of the top investment banks in Silicon Valley, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, a law firm that has long advised Microsoft on its transactions. LinkedIn was advised by the boutique firms Qatalyst and Allen & Company. LinkedIn has long been a client of Allen & Company, while Qatalyst, founded by the longtime deal maker Frank Quattrone, has long been a go-to for tech companies looking to sell themselves. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which previously advised on the takeover of the online learning company Lynda, provided legal counsel to LinkedIn.

2326,"When the Olympics begin in Rio during the first week of August, the eyes of the world will be watching Brazil. The eyes of Brazil, meanwhile, will be watching Camila Pitanga.

A veteran of Brazilian soap operas, Ms. Pitanga is typically cast as a willowy damsel who makes terrible choices when it comes to men. Over the decades she has swooned for a gangster, a conniving executive and an assortment of feckless playboys. Currently, she is falling for her father’s sworn enemy on “Velho Chico,” which airs at 9:15 p.m. on Rede Globo, by far the country’s largest free TV channel.

On weeknights, Globo broadcasts five one-hour telenovelas, a marathon of greed, passion and freighted glances, interrupted only by two newscasts and a sitcom. The most coveted time slot is 9:15, when as many as 50 million people tune in, roughly one-fourth of the country’s population. For the sake of comparison, the Oscars this year brought in 34 million viewers, a little more than one-tenth of all Americans. Of course the Oscars are an annual event. Most telenovelas, as soaps here are called, air Monday through Saturday and have a life of about 200 episodes.

The shows and Globo are the national soundtrack, the running din in living rooms and restaurants, as well as countless taxis with dashboard TVs, adding an unscripted element of suspense for everyone on the road. For Grupo Globo, a multimedia goliath described as “Brazil’s most powerful company” by The Economist, Rede Globo is an engine of profit without peer.

But for organizers of the Summer Olympics, telenovelas are a problem. Last year, before the Zika virus made international headlines, and before the wheel of impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff started turning, the country’s International Olympic Committee representatives would readily profess to one worry: that more Brazilians would watch soaps than the Games.

In fact, this particular Olympic contest will be surprisingly close. And odd as it may sound, telenovelas might win.

While Rede Globo is one of a handful of Brazilian television networks with the rights to air the Games, the rivals have a small fraction of the audience. And though the company will broadcast events throughout the day and parts of the night, Globo will essentially be a sports-free zone during prime time.

Yes, the opening ceremony will be broadcast live. But pre-empt telenovelas between 6:30 and 10:30? No way, said Monica Albuquerque, Globo’s head of artistic development. There will be breaks for highlights and results, but the schedule won’t change just because the greatest athletic spectacle on earth has come to town.

“The country would stop,” she said, if soaps went on hiatus. “It’s cultural. It’s part of life. I can’t imagine Brazil without soaps.”

What if some Brazilian athlete is on a tear?

“You flash,” she said, flicking her fingers, suggesting a blip of time for a quick update.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
2327,"“Our significantly expanded compliance office today not only evaluates new client candidates, but also existing accounts, and especially those that were established prior to the new international regulatory regime coming into effect,” a spokeswoman said in a written statement, referring to a 2010 law passed by Congress. “It wasn’t always this way.”

The firm’s American client list does not appear to include the sort of high-profile political figures who have emerged from reporting on the Panama Papers in many other countries around the world.

But the services offered by Mossack Fonseca, with 500 employees in more than 30 offices worldwide, were in high demand by the rich and famous in the United States.

In 2001, Sanford I. Weill, then the chief of Citigroup, set up an offshore account called April Fool for his yacht. Alfonso Soriano, a former Major League Baseball All-Star player with the Yankees and other teams, had a Panamanian corporation created for him. John E. Akridge III, a leading real estate developer in Washington, flew to Panama to meet with Mossack Fonseca lawyers, who in 2011 created the Cyclops Family Foundation in Panama, along with a related bank account.

A spokesman for Mr. Weill said the accounts were used for legitimate purposes, and “appropriate disclosures were filed.” Mr. Akridge and Mr. Soriano did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

For its best customers, like the Ponsoldts, who declined repeated requests to discuss their work with Mossack Fonseca, the firm’s ministrations went far beyond legal services and banking. It acted as a concierge for “all details regarding your properties and worldwide business affairs,” for example, helping the family confidentially purchase (and dispose of) luxury condominiums at resort destinations and even arranging repairs for a car stored at a vacation home and hiring a contractor to fix broken poolside tiles, the documents show.

“You deserve the best Mr. Ponsoldt, and we will try to help you the most we can,” the firm explained in an email.

The firm’s American clients often expressed disbelief at how much they could lighten their tax burden by using the techniques advocated by Mossack Fonseca.

“At hearing that he can make nearly $8 million per year just on tax savings,” a client from Pennsylvania “was now wide awaken,” a Mossack Fonseca staff member wrote. “I could even detect sweats coming down from his forehead and his cheeks were beginning to blush with crimson excitement. Noticing his interest, I went in for the kill.”

Black Hole for Assets

In 2006, using a secret email account set up by Mossack Fonseca so his correspondence would not be traced by the authorities, a businessman from Washington State asked a common question among the firm’s potential American clients:

“How does a US citizen legally get funds to Panama without the knowledge of the US government and how can those funds be profitably invested without the US government knowing about them?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The reply came from Ramsés Owens, then a partner who helped run the firm’s trust division, offering clients “effective solutions to enhance your privacy, protect your wealth.” Mr. Owens laid out a basic menu of services: a package deal setting up an offshore company in what he promised would be a relatively cheap and quick transaction.

“We have right now a special offer by which we create a Private Foundation/company combination for a flat fee of US$4,500.00,” Mr. Owens said. “It includes Charter Documents, Regulations, nominee officers and directors, bank account and management of funds, provision of authorized signatories, neutral phone and fax numbers and mail forwarding services for both the private foundation and its underlying company.”

With this legal structure in place, Mr. Owens went on to explain, any money placed in these accounts would essentially go into a black hole.

“If we create a Private Foundation and the underlying company for you, the funds become completely private (US cannot know) as soon as the funds are deposited under a bank account or investment account in the name of the underlying company or the private foundation,” he wrote.

The benefits of such an arrangement were numerous, he added, detailing how the client could effectively evade United States tax laws while protecting himself — and the firm.

“You can take the money in cash, you can do a bad investment; you can purchase something and not receive anything (an expensive piano, an expensive software),” Mr. Owens wrote. “You can receive an invoice from Panama or any other location and that would justify some of the outgoing moneys. You can also declare everything to the tax administration.

“Any decision you make, please be aware that you will have to sign a ‘disclaimer’ to us. We can only ‘suggest,’ but the final decision to take the money out of the country is fully yours, and under the professional opinion of someone in USA.”

This was the sort of menu sold to the Ponsoldt family — in a very big way.

William Ponsoldt, now 74, had come to Mossack Fonseca with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, the firm’s staff estimated in “due diligence” memos that also laid out how he had become so wealthy.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“He has started off in the 70ties purchasing run-down apartment buildings in New York, in order to refurbish and sell them off,” noted one memo from 2007, shortly after the firm had started to handle the family’s investment accounts. “Having done this for a while he spread out to various businesses and his CV is the typical profile of a serial entrepreneur.” The memo went on to list nine businesses he had created, taken over or helped run, including Glas Aire Industries Group, an automotive parts supplier; Zeus Energy Resources, a Texas oil-drilling company; Regency Affiliates, which owned a Michigan rock mine; and Pegasus Ranch, one of the country’s largest Arabian-horse-breeding operations.

Few American clients, the records show, demanded and received as much attention as Mr. Ponsoldt and two of his children, Tracey and Christopher, each of whom was assigned a secret email account and a code name — “father,” “daughter” and “son.” Mossack Fonseca’s “V.I.P. service” consisted of everything from securing lunch reservations at a popular French bistro in Panama City to pressing the government to make an exception and grant Mr. Ponsoldt and his wife Panamanian passports.

Over the years, tens of millions of dollars flowed into a series of shell companies — Escutcheon Investment, with its money at the Banca Privada in the Pyrenees principality of Andorra; Probity Investments, with deposits at Andbanc Grup Agricol, also in Andorra; Royal Pacific Investments, with deposits at Balboa Securities in Panama; and Valdano Investments Group, with deposits at Berenberg Bank in Switzerland, among others, the bank records and other documents show.

Mossack Fonseca employees were named as the companies’ officers, avoiding whenever possible any link to the Ponsoldt family. The firm even asked a Hong Kong branch of Barclays, the international bank, to override its rules for proof of the so-called beneficial owners of the accounts.

“This is a very special client of ours,” a Mossack Fonseca lawyer wrote, conceding that the firm had intentionally created such a maze of companies so it “leaves us in the position to legally argue that our client is NOT the owner of the structure.” It was not clear if the bank complied.

The most important part of this elaborate structure was an entity called the Edenstone Foundation.

Panama has long specialized in creating unusual foundations like Edenstone that are neither subject to Panamanian taxes nor required to support charitable causes. They do, however, allow the investors who “contribute” their financing to shield themselves from legal claims in the United States.

In secret meetings documented in the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca named the Ponsoldt family as the beneficiary, through the foundation, of the money placed in bank accounts around the world.

Among the early requests: confidentially transfer $800,000 from “father” to “son,” meaning moving the money to yet another offshore account — called LBFH of Panama — which Mossack Fonseca had set up on Christopher Ponsoldt’s behalf with bank accounts in Andorra and Panama.

One motivation for Christopher Ponsoldt to stash money overseas in accounts not traceable to him: He owned a dirt racetrack in Florida, and he was concerned racers “may get hurt and might then try to sue him for damages,” the law firm notes on his case file said.

“Please notify me when the money is deposited in American dollars,” Christopher Ponsoldt wrote to the law firm a few months after his father’s accounts had been set up and $800,000 was in the process of being transferred to another offshore account Christopher Ponsoldt controlled via the firm. “I want to have U.S. dollars, Australian Dollars, Indian Real’s and some kind of China index, to be determined.”

Mossack Fonseca agreed to “prepare a service agreement” between two of the legal entities it managed for the family, to make it look as if there were an actual expenditure of money for a business purpose.

“After receiving the money, we will explain to them the nature of this transaction without giving details of your name,” the firm explained to William Ponsoldt, regarding the Caribbean bank through which the money was moving to his son. “Please let us know if you agree with this and if you will instruct the relevant parties to execute the wire transfer.”

Federal law generally limits such tax-free transfers between family members to $14,000 a year. But for this transfer, described as a “pre-inheritance distribution,” the documents give no indication that any United States gift taxes were paid, as would most likely have been required, said Jack Blum, a lawyer and expert in international tax evasion who served for more than a decade as a consultant to the Internal Revenue Service.

“This is one way in which people with a lot of money step away from being average,” Mr. Blum said after reviewing the documents.

Christopher Ponsoldt declined to comment. “I am sorry, I can’t help you,” he said before hanging up.

Tracey Ponsoldt Powers, William Ponsoldt’s daughter, approached the firm in October 2008 with an urgent request for help in secretly moving some of her family’s money to Panama and then into gold coins. She feared political developments at home.

“I feel VERY unsettled with this election and how the media is censoring information and spinning the American Public to vote Obama,” she wrote to Mr. Owens at Mossack Fonseca. “It is so obvious to me, that they are setting us up with a Socialist — but most people can’t see it happening before their eyes! It’s like propaganda that is brainwashing Americans to forget the Principles of Hard Work, Ingenuity, Risk and Boundless Success!”

Mr. Owens suggested shifting the money into a “charity” account, controlled by the firm on the family’s behalf, in increments of less than $100,000, so it would not be detected.

Photo

Separately, that same month, William Ponsoldt moved $100,000 from a company Mossack Fonseca controlled on his behalf into the name of his daughter. This was confirmed in an email from Mossack Fonseca to the code name “daughter.” “The USD 100.000 is deposited as call Money with high liquidity at Berenberg Bank Schweiz, Zürich,” said the email, which added: “Your Father initiated this process as you know. We will treat you with the same esteem and conditions and service as the family is used to.”

The subsequent series of complicated transfers — money from the account would eventually be used by Mossack Fonseca in 2013 at Ms. Powers’s request to buy real estate — would be a challenge for American enforcement authorities, Mr. Blum said.

“Simply by constructing all this in such a complex way, they make it extremely hard for enforcement officials to ever have resources to reconstruct what taxes should have been paid,” he said. “What this is all about is obscuring the trail.”

Ms. Powers did not respond to a series of calls and emails, and then declined to answer questions when reached on a cellphone.

“I have no idea what you are talking about,” she said before hanging up.

‘Live This Potential Risk’

Across the United States, Mossack Fonseca picked up clients who had similarly urgent and delicate demands.

For more than 30 years as the founder of Boston Capital Ventures, Harald Joachim von der Goltz has built a reputation as a savvy investor in emerging companies.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What few know, however, is that over roughly that same span of time and with the help of Mossack Fonseca, Mr. von der Goltz has also come to command a vast offshore empire: interconnected corporations, foundations and bank accounts with about $70 million in assets, according to internal emails.

A lawyer for Mr. von der Goltz said the beneficial owner of all of the trusts and accounts is Mr. von der Goltz’s 100-year-old mother, who resides in Guatemala. One document also suggests that the tens of millions of dollars in the accounts originally came from businesses operated by Mr. von der Goltz’s father.

But numerous other documents prepared by Mossack Fonseca and signed by Mr. von der Goltz list him as the founder, manager and “first beneficiary” of the foundation that controls most of the family’s wealth. Mr. von der Goltz also put assets from companies he helped operate into the accounts, documents show.

Most important, Mossack Fonseca registered Mr. von der Goltz as a resident of Guatemala, which tax experts said could help him protect the family money from certain United States tax obligations.

“MF Trust has registered Harald Joachim von der Goltz as a client of Guatemala. However, we know he lives in Miami; and makes his residence for 5 months of the year in Boston,” Mr. Owens, the Mossack Fonseca partner, wrote in an email in 2009 to top executives at the firm.

The firm recognized that claiming the Guatemala residency represented a risk, but considered it a risk worth taking, given Mr. von der Goltz’s importance to the firm.

“My suggestion: Leave everything as it is with von der Goltz, i.e. stay and live this potential risk, we might prefer to send money orders and cashier’s checks, which have a slightly lower risk than bank transfers. It’s all well done, customer understands well and accepts it as is,” Mr. Owens wrote.

“I agree with your suggestion on my part,” responded Ramón Fonseca, one of the firm’s founders.

Money was frequently transferred from several of the offshore accounts to accounts in the United States to fund investments at Mr. von der Goltz’s firm, the documents show. A foundation paid for his daughter’s education, as well as his granddaughter’s high school tuition.

In a 2008 email, Mr. von der Goltz’s Boston-based accountant asked executives at Mossack Fonseca to wire money from Mr. von der Goltz’s mother, Erika.

“Erika would like to make a gift to Tica of $100,000 for his birthday. She hadn’t given him anything,” the email said, providing an account for Mr. von der Goltz at Espírito Santo Bank in Miami.

“Ohh, yes, I know ERIKA wants it to be done quickly, we will proceed,” Mr. Owens responded before confirming that the money should be moved as requested.

Legal experts consulted by The Times said it was difficult to determine definitively if the arrangements related to Mr. von der Goltz violated United States laws. But they said such moves were commonly used by investors seeking to hide their assets and evade federal taxes.

“There is reason to question if she was really directing that shift of money,” Mr. Blum said, referring to Mr. von der Goltz’s mother.

In a statement, Mr. von der Goltz said the companies were established for legal purposes, and that both he and the companies were compliant with United States tax and reporting requirements.

“There has never been any illegal activity associated with these companies,” the statement said.

Other case files examined by The Times show how Mossack Fonseca may have turned a blind eye in the vetting process while helping Kjell Gunnar Finstad, a Texas resident, set up an oil company offshore in 2013.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mossack Fonseca has long maintained that it will not work for individuals with criminal records or whose conduct raises “red flags” during its due-diligence process. But the firm somehow either missed or overlooked Mr. Finstad’s past when it conducted a background search of potential directors for the new offshore oil company, OK Terra Energy, which was run out of Houston but registered in the British Virgin Islands.

Three years earlier, Mr. Finstad, the company’s controlling partner and lead investor, had been convicted in Norway for various breaches of securities and accounting laws involving a company called Norex Group. The case was major news in Norway.

The records examined by The Times show that Mossack Fonseca collected a copy of Mr. Finstad’s passport, and conducted a basic internet search and a cursory background check. But there is no mention of the fraud case, and no discussion of whether to proceed with setting up the new company, in light of Mr. Finstad’s involvement.

Reached at his office in Texas and asked about the Panama Papers, Mr. Finstad said only, “I don’t want to talk about that.”

For another client, Mossack Fonseca offered a special service for a premium price.

Marianna Olszewski, the New York City-based author of “Live It, Love It, Earn It: A Woman’s Guide to Financial Freedom,” wanted to shift $1 million held by HSBC in Guernsey to a new overseas account. The catch? She did not want her name to appear anywhere near the transaction.

Mr. Owens, the Mossack Fonseca lawyer, again offered a solution.

Mossack Fonseca would locate what he called a “natural person nominee” in a “tax-convenient” jurisdiction to stand in for Ms. Olszewski as the owner of the account.

“The Natural Person Trustee is a service which is very sensitive,” Mr. Owens wrote. “We need to hire the Natural Person Nominee, pay him, make him sign lots of documents to cover us, make him sign resignations, make him get some proofs evidencing that he has the economic capacity to place such amount of moneys, letters of reference, proof of domicile, etc., etc.” The process, he suggested, would cost her at least $17,500.

Ms. Olszewski approved the maneuver — only to see the firm, at one point, accidentally disclose her name to the banks involved.

“Ramses, Please call me ASAP!! This is important!!!!” she wrote to Mr. Owens. “HSBC said someone said marianna olszewski is the principal / beneficary! Who has done this!! I need you to call me immediately and tell them hsbc that was a mistake!!!!!!!!!! This is not good and I asked you NOT to do this! this is why we have this structure.”

Mr. Owens sought to calm her down, saying that Mossack Fonseca could tell the bank that the natural person nominee actually controlled the account. “This can be solved,” he wrote.

Mr. Owens did not tell his client the identity of the natural person nominee, saying simply, “We would appoint a UK citizen residing in Panama since 50 years ago, engineer, entrepreneur,” as they needed someone who would be expected to have such a large amount of money available to transfer.

Twelve days later, Mr. Owens sent HSBC a copy of a passport for a man named Edmund James Ward.

“Kindly please find hereto attached the due diligence documents of the beneficial owner,” said the email sent to HSBC, noting that “the documents duly correct.”

The $1 million from Ms. Olszewski was then transferred to the new accounts, with an assurance that she need not worry.

“If for any reason something happens, please also bear in mind that Mossfon is covered by insurance policies for US$10 Million (per event),” Mr. Owens wrote. “We have never used our insurance policy to cover a ‘fraud,’ or something like this.”

The use of a stand-in to hide the true ownership of an account is one of the remaining illegal ploys favored by Americans today as international banks, under pressure from the United States, demand proof of account ownership, said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor from Miami who specialized in criminal tax offenses, adding that he could not comment directly on this case. “The fact that a law firm was willing to do this legitimizes the process for their clients,” he said.

A Firm’s Inner Doubts

Many of the client files — like those for Mr. Weill, the banker; Mr. Soriano, the ballplayer; and Mr. Akridge, the developer — contain little information on the purpose of the offshore accounts, or how they were used after they were set up, making it impossible, based on the records available, to assess whether they were used legitimately.

But the experts who reviewed some of the documents related to the Ponsoldts, Mr. von der Goltz and Ms. Olszewski said that the firm itself seemed to realize it was taking risks.

“They were not always sure themselves which side of the line they were on at any given moment,” said Ross S. Delston, a former federal banking regulator who now specializes in combating money-laundering efforts. “It is apparent that members of the firm were aware they were treading very close to the line.”

In fact, the files contain instances, beginning before the Panama Papers came to light, of Mossack Fonseca lawyers second-guessing their actions. (In recent weeks, the firm has shut down many of its operations in Nevada, as well as British locations in Jersey and the Isle of Man, and is closing the asset-management division that served many of its United States clients.)

In 2013, Mossack Fonseca advised Ms. Olszewski to seek outside counsel and consider reporting herself to the I.R.S., warning of possible “severe” repercussions if she did not. The warning came in the wake of a Justice Department investigation of the role that certain Swiss banks had played in helping United States citizens evade federal taxes.

Records show that Mossack Fonseca had been paid at least $102,000 over nine years to help Ms. Olszewski handle various transactions.

Ms. Olszewski took the firm’s advice, and belatedly disclosed her accounts to the I.R.S., the documents show. And by 2014, she asked Mossack Fonseca to shut down her accounts and offshore entities, which collectively held at least $1.7 million.

“I’m in complete compliance with all my U.S. tax and reporting requirements,” Ms. Olszewski said in an emailed statement when The Times asked about the accounts.

In a second statement, she said she had relied on the advice of legal counsel to establish a trust for her family while living abroad. “I am confident that I have acted properly,” she added, “and any insinuation otherwise is false.”

Reached by telephone in late May, Mr. Owens, who is no longer with the law firm, said only, “Regretfully, I cannot speak about individual clients or my time at Mossack Fonseca.”

Mossack Fonseca sent a series of similar and increasingly dire warnings to the Ponsoldts in 2013 and 2014, telling them that they had to provide a Swiss bank with documentation that they had paid all required United States taxes — or face possible investigation.

“Neither your ex Trustees nor us would like to be involved into any measure the US Department of Justice might try to enforce,” the firm wrote. “In this regard, again we strongly urge you to take the necessary steps to avoid any negative consequences for you as well as us.”

The records examined by The Times give no indication whether the Ponsoldts complied, and family members would not say when asked.

“I don’t know what you are talking about,” Christopher Ponsoldt said in a second brief conversation before he again hung up.","Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal",2015-12-16,The agreement means we have a chance to avoid unmanageable effects of global warming and to handle the effects we can’t avoid.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/opinion/paris-climate-accord-is-a-big-big-deal.html
