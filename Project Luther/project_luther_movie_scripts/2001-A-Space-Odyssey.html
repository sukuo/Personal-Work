<b>TITLE					    PART I
</b><b>					    AFRICA
</b><b>					    3,000,000 YEARS AGO
</b>
<b>A1
</b><b>VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT
</b>
The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,
and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-
rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not
yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.

										 a1

<b>A2
</b><b>INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER
</b>
The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and
they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.
About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.

The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.
As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know
the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond
his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-
iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then
he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the
hyenas.

Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly
five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over
a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,
and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is
low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As
he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already

										 a2

<b>A2
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those
dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-
tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years.

										 a3

<b>A3
</b><b>EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS
</b>
As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream.

The Others are already there. They were there on the other
side every day - that did not make it any less annoying.

There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As
they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply
In kind.

The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has
staked its claim to its own territory.

										 a4

<b>A4
</b><b>EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES
</b>
Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit
and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around
them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet
all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.

										 a5

<b>A5
</b><b>EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION
</b>
The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-
side foraging for roots and occasional berries.

Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,
about fifty feet apart.

The ground is flat for miles around.

Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking
them about 300 yards away.

Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all
directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.

										 a6

<b>A6
</b><b>EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY
</b>
It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no
real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day
with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a
hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he
also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices
them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever
likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually
weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could
hope for.

										 a7

<b>A7
</b><b>INT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS
</b>
Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -
but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;
it was merely part of the background of life.

This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,
was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.
If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave.

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,
and though he could not remember it, when he was young,
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.
Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high
enough.

He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the

										 a8

<b>A7
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down
there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.

And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come.

										 a9

<b>A8
</b><b>EXT  THE STREAM - INVASION
</b>
The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When
they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins.

In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,
shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led
by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.

Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first
advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a
mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own
territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.
He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his
experience.

Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing

										 a10

<b>A8
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they
move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy
they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original
drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.

As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately
revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill
his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership.

Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away.

The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other.

Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,
and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,

										 a11

<b>A8
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,
and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is
so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening
In Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.

Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.

With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the
stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
The water's edge.

										 a12

<b>EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND
</b>
Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound.

He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his
senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.
Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of
his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The
great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional
cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous
beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at
concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.

And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet.

										 a13

<b>A10
</b><b>EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK
</b>
Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he
leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.
He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing
had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There
is nothing in the least alarming about it.

It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of
some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.
There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious
of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.
As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,
hard surface.

After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a
brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it
must have grown during the night. There are many plants
that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that
they are small and round, whereas this is large and square;

										 a14

<b>A10
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few
that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?

A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.
There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.

										 a15

<b>A11
</b><b>EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON
</b>
They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the
sound begins.

It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube
and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first
time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of
drumming is heard in Africa.

The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards
the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little
dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet.

Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting
the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,
and the hunger in their bellies.

Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,

										 a16

<b>A11
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-
eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.

Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four
hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's
own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog
lies near them.

This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From
time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.
The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally
different scene.

The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;
it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.

										 a17

<b>A11
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species.

But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon
its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.
And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one
amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.

Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement
can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene
freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless
above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.

The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if

										 a18

<b>A11
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle
back to their caves.

They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that
night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher
feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge
to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.

										 a19

<b>A12
</b>EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia

Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-
year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others
threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.
In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition.

They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no
longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons
well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the Cube had revealed to them.

They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they
had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.
Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did
not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave.

But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The
first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for

										 a20

<b>A12
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to
die of starvation.

										 a21

<b>A13
</b><b>EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION
</b>
With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,
betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.

When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,
they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound
of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave
against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their
strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.

The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these
creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life; he goes back to his meal.

The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with
amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.

Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

										 a22

<b>A13
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-
confidence and bad luck.

The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory.

<b>					  * * * * * * * *

And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done.

</b><b>EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD
</b>
From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of
their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-
looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.

The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today
something is different, though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact.

Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and
begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen.

As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence.

At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They
carry their bone clubs and bone knives.

										 a24

<b>A14
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-
chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their
hearts.

Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,
displaying its frightful fangs.

The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.

Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.
Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled
standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed
by his band.

The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even
the ability to flee.

Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands

										 a25

<b>A14
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
unsurely in front of his band.

Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club
until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him.

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.

Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the
world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would
think of something.

<b>					    FLOYD

<b>					    SMYSLOV
</b>					    Well, it's just for the past

					    some extremely odd things
					    happening at Clavius.

<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    Really?

<b>					    SMYSLOV
</b>					    Yes. Well, for one thing,
					    whenever you phone the base,

					    that was the explanation, but
					    it's been going on for the past

<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    You mean you haven't been able

</b>					    That's right.

<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    I see.

</b>					    Another thing, Heywood, two

</b>					    Yes, and I'm afaid there's

</b>					    Certainly.

<b>					    SMYSLOV
</b>					    Quite frankly, we have had some
					    very reliable intelligence reports
					    that a quite serious epidemic
					    has broken out at Clavius.
					    Something, apperently, of an
					    unknown origin. Is this, in

</b>					    This epidemic could easily

</b>					    Oh, marvellous. It's the first

</b>					    There's nothing like weightless

</b>					    When do we arrive at Clavius?

</b>					    We're scheduled to dock in about

</b>					    What do you mean?

<b>					    PILOT
</b>					    Well... the crew is confined to

					    haven't been able to get her on

<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    I see. Well, I'm sorry about that.
					    I wouldn't think there's any cause
					    for alarm.

<b>					    PILOT
</b>					    Yes, well, I wouldn't have been
					    too concerned about it, except
					    I've heard these stories about the
					    epidemic and, as a matter of fact,

					    has asked me to convey his
					    deepest appreciation to all of
					    you for the personal sacrifices
					    you have made, and of course

</b>
					    FLOYD (cont'd)
					    Mr. Halvorsen has made known
					    to me some of the conflicting
					    views held by many of you
					    regarding the need for complete
					    security in this matter, and
					    more specifically your strong
					    opposition to the cover story
					    created to give the impression
					    there is an epidemic at the Base.
					    I understand that beyond it being
					    a matter of principle, many of
					    you are troubled by the concern
					    and anxiety this story of an
					    epidemic might cause your
					    relatives and friends on Earth.

					    I can understand and sympathize
					    with your negative views. I have
					    been personally embarrassed by
					    this cover story. But I fully
					    accept the need for absolute
					    secrecy and I hope you will.

					    It should not be difficult for all
					    of you to realise the potential for
					    cutural shock and social
					    disorientation contained in the
					    present situation if the facts
					    were prematurely and suddenly
					    made public without adequate
					    preparation and conditioning.

11/25/65										 b55 

<b>B38
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    This is the view of the Council
					    and the purpose of my visit here
					    is to gather addition facts and
					    opinions on the situation and to
					    prepare a report to the Council
					    recommending when and how the
					    news should eventually be
					    announced. Are there any
					    questions?

<b>					    MICHAELS
</b>					    Dr. Floyd, how long do you think
					    this can be kept under wraps?

<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    (pleasantly)
					    I'm afraid it can and it will be
					    kept under wraps as long as it
					    is deemed to be necessary by
					    the Council. And of course you
					    know that the Council has requested
					    that formal security oaths are to
					    be obtained in writing from every-
					    one who had any knowledge of this
					    event. There must be adequate
					    time for a full study to be made

</b>
<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    Any ideas about the colour?

<b>					    MICHAELS
</b>					    Well, not really. At first glance,

					    powered device?

<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    Has it been exposed to any sun

</b>
<b>					    NARRATOR
</b>					    A hundred million miles beyond
					    Mars, in the cold lonliness
					    where no man had yet travelled,
					    Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts
					    slowly among the tangled orbits
					    of the asteroids.

<b>					    NARRATOR
</b>					    Radiation detectors noted and
					    analyzed incoming cosmic rays
					    from the galaxy and points beyond;
					    neutron and x-ray telescopes
					    kept watch on strange stars that
					    no human eye would eever see;
					    magnetometers observed the
					    gusts and hurricanes of the solar
					    winds, as the sun breathed million
					    mile-an-hour blasts of plasma
					    into the faces of its circling
					    children.

<b>					    NARRATOR
</b>					    All these things and many others
					    were patiently noted by Deep-
					    Space-Monitor-79, and recorded
					    in its crystalline memory.

</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    NARRATOR
</b>					    But now it had noted something
					    strange - the faint yet
					    unmistakable distrubance rippling
					    across the solar system, and
					    quite unlike any natural phenomena
					    it had ever observed in the past.

<b>					    NARRATOR
</b>					    It was also observed by Orbiter
					    M-15, circling Mars twice a
					    day; and High Inclination Probe-
					    21, climbing slowly above the
					    planet of the ecliptic; and even
					    artificial Comet-5, heading out
					    into the cold wastes beyond
					    Pluto, along an orbit whose
					    far point it would not reach for
					    a thousand years.

<b>					    NARRATOR
</b>					    All noticed the peculiar burst of
					    energy that leaped from the face
					    of the Moon and moved across
					    the solar system, throwing off a
					    spray of radiation like the wake of
					    a racing speedboat.

</b>
<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like
					    your advice on something.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Sure, what is it?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Well, it's nothing really important,
					    but it's annoying.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    What's up?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    It's about my salary cheques.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Yes?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Well I got the papers on my
					    official up-grading to AGS-19
					    two weeks before we left.

12/14/65										 c12 

<b>C12
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Yes, I remember you mentioning it.
					    I got mine about the same time.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    That's right. Well, naturally,
					    I didn't say anything to Payroll.
					    I assumed they'd start paying me
					    at the higher grade on the next pay
					    cheque. But it's been almost
					    three weeks now and I'm still
					    being paid as an AGS-18.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Interesting that you mention it,
					    because I've got the same problem.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Really.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Yes.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Yesterday, I finally called the
					    Accounting Office at Mission
					    Control, and all they could tell me
					    was that they'd received the AGS-19
					    notification for the other three but
					    not mine, and apparently not yours
					    either.

12/14/65										 c13 

<b>C12
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Did they have any explanation for
					    this?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Not really. They just said it might
					    be because we trained at Houston and
					    they trained in Marshall, and that
					    we're being charged against differ-
					    ent accounting offices.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    It's possible.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Well, what do you think we ought
					    to do about it?

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    I don't think we should make any
					    fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll
					    straighten it out.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    I must say, I never did understand
					    why they split us into two groups
					    for training.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    No. I never did, either.

12/14/65										 c14 

<b>C12
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    We spent so little time with them,
					    I have trouble keeping their names
					    straight.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    I suppose the idea was specialized
					    training.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    I suppose so. Though, of course,
					    there's a more sinister explanation.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Oh?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Yes. You must have heard the
					    rumour that went around during
					    orbital check-out.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Oh, well, apparently there's
					    something about the mission that
					    the sleeping beauties know that
					    we don't know, and that's why we
					    were trained separately and
					    that's why they were put to sleep
					    before they were even taken aboard.

12/14/65										 c15 

<b>C12
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Well, what is it?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    I don't know. All I heard is that
					    there's something about the
					    mission we weren't told.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    That seems very unlikely.

<b>					    POOLE 
</b>					    Yes, I thought so.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Of course, it would be very easy
					    for us to find out now.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    How?

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Just ask Hal. It's conceivable
					    they might keep something from
					    us, but they'd never keep anything
					    from Hal.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    That's true.

12/14/65										 c15a 

<b>C12						   
</b><b>CONINUED
</b>
<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    (sighs)  Well... it's silly, but...
					    if you want to, why don't you?

<b>POOLE WALKS TO THE
</b><b>HAL 9000 COMPUTER
</b>
<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Hal... Dave and I believe that
					    there's something about the
					    mission that we weren't told.
					    Something that the rest of the
					    crew know and that you know.
					    We'd like to know whether this
					    is true.

<b>					    HAL
</b>					    I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't
					    think I can answer that question
					    without knowing everything that
					    all of you know.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    He's got a point.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Okay, then how do we re-phrase
					    the question?

12/14/65										 c15c	  

<b>C12 
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Still, you really don't believe it,
					    do you?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Not really. Though, it is strange
					    when you think about it. It didn't
					    really make any sense to keep
					    us apart during training.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Yes, but it's to fantastic to think
					    that they'd keep something from us.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    I know. It would be almost
					    inconceivable.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    But not completely inconceivable?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    I guess it isn't.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.

12/14/65										 c15b
<b> 
</b><b>C12
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    BOWMAN
</b>					    Well, the only important aspect of
					    the mission are: where are we
					    going, what will we do when we
					    get there, when are we coming
					    back, and... why are we going?

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Right. Hal, tell me whether the
					    following statements are true or
					    false.

<b>					    HAL
</b>					    I will if I can, Frank.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Our Mission Profile calls for
					    Discovery going to Saturn.
					    True or false?

<b>					    HAL
</b>					    True.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Our transit time is 257 days. Is
					    that true?

<b>					    HAL
</b>					    That's true.

12/14/65										 c15d
<b> 
</b><b>C12
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    At the end of a hundred days of
					    exploration, we will all go into 
					    hibernation. Is this true?

<b>					    HAL
</b>					    That's true.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Approximately five years after we
					    go into hibernation, the recovery
					    vehicle will make rendezous with
					    us and bring us back. Is this true?

<b>					    HAL
</b>					    That's true

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    There is no other purpose for this
					    mission than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program,
					    and to further our general
					    knowledge of the planets. Is that
					    true?

<b>					    HAL
</b>					    That's true.

<b>					    POOLE
</b>					    Thank you very much, Hal.

</b>					    I wouldn't worry too much about
					    the computer. First of all,
					    there is still a chance that he
					    is right, despite your tests,
					    and if it should happen again,
					    we suggest eliminating this
					    possibility by allowing the unit
					    to remain in place and seeing
					    whether or not it actually fails.

					    If the computer should turn out
					    to be wrong, the situation is
					    still not alarming. The type
					    of obsessional error he may be
					    guilty of is not unknown among
					    the latest generation of HAL
					    9000 computers.

					    It has almost always revolved
					    around a single detail, such as
					    the one you have described, and
					    it has never interfered with the
					    integrity or reliability of the
					    computer's performance in
					    other areas.

					    No one is certain of the cause
					    of this kind of malfunctioning.

<b>					    SIMONSON
</b>					    Hello, Dave. I think we may be on
					    to an explanation of the trouble with
					    the Hal 9000 computer.

					    We believe it all started about two
					    months ago when you and Frank
					    interrogated the computer about
					    the Mission.
									 (con't)
12/13/65										 c119

<b>C148

</b>
					    SIMONSON (con't)
					    You may have forgotten it, but
					    we've been running through all
					    the monitor tapes. Do you
					    remember this?

<b>					    POOLE'S VOICE
</b>					    The purpose of this mission is no
					    more than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program
					    and further our general knowledge
					    of the planets. Is this true?

<b>					    HAL'S VOICE
</b>					    That is true.

<b>					    SIMONSON
</b>					    Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying.
					    He had been programmed to lie
					    about this one subject for secur-
					    ity reasons which we'll explain
					    later.

					    The true purpose of the Mission
					    was to have been explained to you
					    by Mission Commander Kaminsky,
					    on his revival. Hal knew this and
					    he knew the actual mission, but
					    he couldn't tell you the truth when
					    you challenged him. Under orders
										    (con't)

12/13/65										 c120
<b> 
</b><b>C148
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
					    SIMONSON (con't)
					    from earth he was forced to lie.

					    In everything except this he had
					    the usual reinforced truth program-
					    ming.

					    We believe his truth programming
					    and the instructions to lie,
					    gradually resulted in an
					    incompatible conflict, and
					    facedc with this dilemman, he
					    developed, for want of a better
					    description, neurotic symptoms.

					    It's not difficult to suppose that
					    these symptoms would centre on
					    the communication link with
					    Earth, for he may have blamed
					    us for his incompatible program-
					    ming.

					    Following this lin of thought, we
					    suspected that the last straw for him
					    was the possibility of disconnection.
					    Since he became operational, he had
					    never known unconsciousness. It
					    must have seemed the equivalent to
					    death.
										   (con't)
12/13/65										 c121

<b>C148
</b><b>CONTINUED
</b>
					    SIMONSON (con't)
					    At this point, he, presumably,
					    took whatever actions he thought
					    appropriate to protect himself
					    from what must have seemed to
					    him to be his human tormentors.

					    If I cane speak in human terms,
					    I don't think we can blame him
					    too much. We have ordered him
					    to disobey his conscience.

					    Well, that's it. It's very
					    speculative, but we think it is
					    a possible explanation. Anyway,
					    good luck on the rest of the 
					    Mission and I'm giving you back to
					    Bernard.

12/13/65										 c123

<b>C150
</b><b>FLOYD'S RECORDED
</b><b>BRIEFING
</b>
<b>					    FLOYD
</b>					    Good day, gentlemen. When you
					    see this briefing, I presume you
					    will be nearing your destination,
					    Saturn. I hope that you've had a
					    pleasant and uneventful trip and
					    that the rest of your mission
					    continues in the same manner. I
					    should like to fill you in on some
					    more of the details on which
					    Mission Commander Kaminsky
					    will have already briefed you.

					    Thirteen months before the launch
					    date of your Saturn mission, on
					    April 12th, 2001, the first evidence
					    for intelligent life outside the Earth
					    was discovered.

					    It was found buried at a depth of
					    fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.
					    No news of this was ever announced,
					    and the event had been kept
					    secret since then, for reasons which
					    I will later explain.

					    Soon after it was uncovered, it
					    emitted a powerful blast of
										 (con't)

					    FLOYD (con't)
					    radiation in the radio spectrum
					    which seems to have triggered
					    by the Lunar sunrise.

					    Luckily for those at the site, it
					    proved harmless.

					    Perhaps you can imagine our
					    astonishment when we later found
					    it was aimed precisely at Saturn.
					    A lot of thought went into the
					    question of wether or not it was
					    sun-triggered, as it seemed
					    illogical to deliberately bury a
					    sun-powered device.

					    Burying it could only shield it
					    from the sun, since its intense
					    magnetic field made it otherwise
					    easily detectable.

					    We finally concluded that the only
					    reason you might bury a sun-
					    powered device would be to keep
					    it inactive until it would be
					    uncovered, at which time it would
					    absorb sunlight and trigger itself.

					    the moon about four million years
					    ago, when our ancestors were

					    We've examined dozens of theories,
					    but the one that has the most
					    currency at the moment is that
					    the object serves as an alarm.

					    What the purpose of the alarm is,
					    why they wish to have the alarm,
					    whether the alarm represents
					    any danger to us?  These are
					    questions no one can answer.
					    The intentions of an alien world,
					    at least four million years older
					    than we are, cannot be reliably
					    predicted.

					    In view of this, the intelligence
					    and scientific communities felt
					    that any public announcment
					    might lead to significant cultural
					    shock and disorientation.

					    Those who had begun the expri-
					    ment so long ago had not been
					    men.

					    But when they looked out across
					    the deeps of space, they felt
					    awe and wonder - and loneliness.

					    In their explorations, they
					    encountered life in many forms,
					    and watched on a thousand worlds
					    the workings of evolution.

					    They saw how often the first faint
					    sparks of intelligence flickered
					    and died in the cosmic night.

					    And because, in all the galaxy,
					    they had found nothing more
					    precious than Mind, they
					    encouraged its dawning every-
					    where.

					    The great Dinosaurs had long
					    since perished when their ships
					    entered the solar system, after
					    a voyage that had already lasted
					    thousands of years.

					    On Earth, the glaciers came and

					    With a yet slower rhythm than
					    the Polar ice, the tide of
					    civilization ebbed and flowed
					    across the galaxy.

					    Strange and beautiful and terrible
					    empires rose and fell, and passed
					    on their knowledge to their
					    successors.

					    Earth was not forgotten, but it was
					    one of a million silent worlds, a
					    few of which would ever speak.

					    Then the first explorers of Earth,
					    recognising the limitations of
					    their minds and bodies, passed
					    on their knowledge to the great
					    machines they had created, and
					    who now trnscended them in

</b>					    For a few thousand years, they
					    shared their Universe with their
					    machine children; then, realizing
					    that it was folly to linger when
					    their task was done, they passed
					    into history without regret.

					    Not one of them ever looked through
					    his own eyes upon the planet Earth
					    again.

					    But even the age of the Machine
					    Entities passed swiftly. In their
					    ceaseless experimenting, they
					    had learned to store knowledge
					    in the structure of space itself,
					    and to preserve their thoughts
					    for eternity in frozen lattices
					    of light. They could become
					    creatures of radiation, free
					    at last from the tyranny of matter.

					    Now, they were Lords of the
					    galaxy, and beyond the reach
					    of time.

					    They could rove at will among the
					    stars, and sink like a subtle mist
					    through the very interstices of

					    But despite their God-like powers,

					    The companion of Saturn knew
					    nothing of this, as it orbited
					    in its no man's land between Mimas
					    and the outer edge of rings.

					    It had only to remember and wait,
					    and to look forever Sunward with
					    its strange senses.

					    For many weeks, it had watched
					    the approaching ship. Its long-
					    dead makers had prepared it for
					    many things and this was one of
					    them. And it recognised what
					    was climbing starward from the
					    Sun.

					    If it had been alive, it would have

					    emotion was irrelevant to its

					    Even if the ship had passed it by,
					    it would not have known the
					    slightest trace of disappointment.

					    It had waited four million years;
					    it was prepared to wait for
					    eternity.

					    Presently, it felt the gentle touch
					    of radiations, trying to probe its
					    secrets.

					    Now, the ship was in orbit and it
					    began to speak, with prime
					    numbers from one to eleven,
					    over and over again.

					    Soon, these gave way to more
					    complex signals at many frequen-
					    cies, ultra-violet, infra-red,
					    X-rays.

					    The machine made no reply. It
					    had nothing to say.

					    tiny scout was reporting back to
					    its parent; but it was too simple,
					    too primative a device to detect
					    the forces that were gathering
					    round it now.

					    Then the pod came, carrying
					    life. The great machine searched
					    its memories.

					    The logic circuits made their
					    decision when the pod had fallen
					    beyond the last faint glow of the
					    reflected Saturnian light.

					    In a moment of time, too short to
					    be measured, space turned and
