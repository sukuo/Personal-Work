</b>


           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

<b>          CUT TO BLACK.
</b>
          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

<b>                         ARE IN:
</b>
<b>          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT
</b>
          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

<b>                         QUIET:
</b>
<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

<b>          ROLLS OFF FAST --
</b>
<b>          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           "The General." To me, she's royalty.
           Well, she certainly is that.

<b>                          POE
</b>          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           We've got company.

<b>          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

<b>          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.
</b>
<b>                          POE
</b>           You have to hide.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           You have to leave. Go!
          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

<b>          IN THE DISTANCE.
</b>          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

<b>                          POE
</b>           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

<b>          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --
</b>
<b>          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
</b>          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

<b>                         HIM:
</b>
<b>                          SENIOR TROOPER
</b>           Stay here.
          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Look how old you've become.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           Something far worse has happened to
           you.
          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
          stormtroopers.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           You know what I've come for.

                         

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           I know where you come from. Before

          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA

          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES

          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the

          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves

          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING

          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER
</b>
          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY
</b>
          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

<b>          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY
</b>
          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

<b>          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
</b>          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
          engine and DRIVES OFF.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

<b>          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY
</b>
          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

<b>                          UNKAR
</b>           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

<b>          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY

          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

<b>          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

</b>           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)

<b>           NOMA.
</b>          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)

          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come

<b>          EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY
</b>
          TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
          to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
          WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
          A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
          Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
          gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Poe! Poe!
          Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
          SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
          sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
          He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
          to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)

          Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
          INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

<b>           POE!!! POE!!!
</b>          It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
          get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
          as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
          few moments and IT'S GONE.
          Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
          ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
          Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
          And all alone.

          ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
          Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

          Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
          nothingness.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
</b>
          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

<b>          BEEPING BB-8.
</b>          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

<b>                          REY
</b>           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

<b>                          REY

<b>                          FINN

          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

</b>           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

<b>                          REY
</b>           So you're with the Resistance?

<b>                          (WHISPERS)
</b>           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

<b>                          REY
</b>           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

           he has to get back to your base.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a

          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles

          in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
          LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
          feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
          and powerful, all at the same time.

          Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked

          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

<b>          DOOR OPENS.
</b>          Hesitant, Rey enters.

<b>          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

<b>                          REY

<b>          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY
</b>
          A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
          OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
          SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
          RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>           Today is the end of the Republic!
           The end of a regime that acquiesces
           to disorder! At this very moment,
           in a system far from here the New
           Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
           secretly supporting the treachery of
           the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
           machine which you have built, upon
           which we stand, will bring an end to

          ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
          to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

<b>          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
</b>
          A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

<b>          SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC
</b>
<b>          BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO

          For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
          Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
          CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
          Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
          eyes, CUT TO:

<b>          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
          TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

<b>          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY
</b>
          Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
          makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
          runs cold, his heart sinks.

<b>          EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

          The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
          structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
          horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --

          A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
          FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
          horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.

           Where's Rey?

<b>          EXT. FOREST - DAY
</b>
          Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
          overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
          she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
          A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

<b>                          REY

<b>                          (HE BEEPS)

           They'll help you.
          Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
          front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
          ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

<b>          FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!

<b>          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
          DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
          OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
          and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
          Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
          STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

          And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
          COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
          Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
          Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
          again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

          Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright
          restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask
          in place, standing there.

           You'll be relieved to hear that I

</b>           That happens when you're being hunted
           by a creature in a mask.
          Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
          and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
          before she regains her own mask of defiance.

<b>                          KYLO REN

<b>                          REY
</b>           (a nervous beat)
           He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
           and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           He's carrying a section of a
           navigational chart. We have the
           rest, recovered from archives of the
           Empire. We need the last piece.
           And somehow, you convinced the droid
           to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
          Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

<b>           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
</b>           You know I can take whatever I want.
          Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
          his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
          go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
          THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
          between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
          And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
          quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

<b>           KYLO REN (CONT'D)

          Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
          break free, but can't budge.

<b>           KYLO REN (CONT'D)

<b>          DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
</b>          On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
          slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
          certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
          FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

          is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on

          happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
          emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
          moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
          She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
          intense beat. Then says:

          The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
          Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
          laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:

          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,

          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR

          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch

          vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole

          HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
          down into the filter.
          Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
          WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
          toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
          OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
          From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

<b>          HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.

          watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
          THAT BISECTS the open space.
          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
          CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
          edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Ben!
          The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast

          Kylo flares.

          UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
          dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
          ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Snoke is using you for your power.
           When he gets what he wants, he'll
           crush you -- you know it's true.
          Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

<b>                          KYLO REN

<b>                          HAN
</b>           No it's not. Leave here with me.
           Come home. We miss you.
          For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
          flood his stoic eyes...

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           I'm being torn apart. I want to be
           free of this pain.

<b>          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS

          Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           I know what I have to do, but I don't
           know if I have the strength to do
           it. Will you help me?
          Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Yes. Anything.
          Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
          Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
          it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
          LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

<b>          VANISHES.

          REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his

          From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from

</b>
          And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
          see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
          US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

<b>          INT. X-WING - NIGHT
</b>

<b>                          POE
</b>           All teams! I got eyes on them!

<b>                          SNAP
</b>           Yes!
          The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
          IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
          get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
          Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
          corner of the galaxy.
          The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
          headed home.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Our job's done here. Let's go home!

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

<b>          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
</b>
          The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
          Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
          carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
          meet them, usher them inside.

<b>                          MEDIC
</b>           Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
           heartbeat.
          Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
          C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
          Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
          The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
          face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
          She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
          Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

<b>          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
</b>
          Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
          their losses.
          As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
          stirs. The droids beep at each other.

<b>                          C-3PO
</b>           R2-D2! You've come back! You found
           what? How dare you call me that!

<b>                          (MORE)
</b>
                         

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>           C-3PO (CONT'D)
</b>           (he swats R2-D2, who

<b>                          CONTINUES BEEPING)
</b>           Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
           must go tell the others at once!

<b>          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
</b>
          Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

<b>           C-3PO (O.S.)
</b>           General? Excuse me, General?
          Leia turns to see droids.

<b>           C-3PO (CONT'D)
</b>           R2-D2 may contain some much needed
           good news.

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           Tell me.
          Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
          Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

<b>          LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
</b>          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

<b>                          POE
</b>           Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
          Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
          San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
          back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
          SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

<b>          TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN
</b>
<b>          R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
</b>          Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

<b>                          C-3PO
</b>           Oh! The map! It is complete!

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           (hand on her heart)
           -- Luke --
          Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
          C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

<b>                          C-3PO
</b>           (to R2-D2)
           Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
           you.

<b>          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY
</b>
          A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
          uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
          despite her fear:

<b>                          REY
</b>           We'll see each other again. I believe
           that. Thank you, my friend.

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

<b>                          LEIA (CONT'D)
</b>           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

<b>          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
</b>
          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

<b>          EXT. SPACE - DAY
</b>
          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
</b>
          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
</b>
          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY
</b>
          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY
</b>
          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

<b>          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.
</b>
          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

<b>          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
</b>          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
          of an adventure, just beginning...
