</b><b><LI>EXT. BANGKOK. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>A single headlamp in close up shines directly and brightly out</P>
<P>Extreme noise and light.</P>
<P>Beyond its glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle ("tuk-tud") and its Thai driver</P>
<P>A young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him, swaying with the motion of the vehicle. He is worn and sweating.</P>
<P>They travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, road works, food vendors, dogs, tourists.</P>
<P>Music and credits.</P>
<b></OL>
</b>
<b><OL START=2>
</b><b></I><LI>EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT</LI>
</b><I><P>The bright headlight comes to a halt. </P>
<P>Richard climbs down from the tuk-tuk</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>When you hit Bangkok, there's really only one place to go.</P>
<I><P>The street is busy, full of Thai's and travelers.</P>
<P>Richard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his back.</P>
<P>He absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, and the shops and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, travel tickets, and international phone calls. Restaurantes are filled with western travelers watching American films or European sport.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>The Khao San Road is a decompression chamber between east and west. It's where you learn to breathe car fumes and tropical air for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange your memories before you catch your flight home.</P>
<I><P>Richard is approached by a young male Thai Hustler who walks backwards in front of him while making his pitch.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HUSTLER</P>
</b></B><P>You need somewhere to stay?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD </P>
</b></B><P>I'll be OK, Thanks.</P>
<I><P>Richard politely ignores each of his subsequent offers.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HUSTLER</P>
</b></B><P>What do you want? Sell your passport? Buy passport? Airline tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? You get a suit in twenty-four hours. Diamonds? You want to come with me, you get present for your girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem. You want to drink some snake blood?</P>
<I><P>At this last one Richard stops and addresses the Hustler.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>No thanks.</P>
<I><P>Richard walks on, the hustler fading out behind him.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HUSTLER</P>
</b></B><P>You want designer clothes? I get you Versache, Gucci, Armani, no problem. You want a camera, all the best makes: Nikon, Leica, Canon I can get you.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)	</P>
</b><P>Yeah, it's all here: you an phone home, meet up with strangers, split up with your friends, watch Hollywood movies while you sip Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and green chicken soup. You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only find it here. And what do they want, all these people?</P></OL>

<b><OL START=3>

</b><I><P>Various young travelers, male and female, in snapsho9t exerpts, address their comments to the camera or each other.</P>
<b></I><B><P>TRAVELER 1</P>
</b></B><P>Where you been?</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER 2</P>
</b></B><P>Where you going?</P>

</b></B><P>Fantastic</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER 3</P>
</b></B><P>How much did it cost?</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER5</P>
</b></B><P>A complete rip off.</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER3</P>
</b></B><P>Too many people. There's a much better place along the coast.</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER 4</P>
</b></B><P>We're going exploring. We've read this book. It tells us all the best places to explore.</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER 2</P>
</b></B><P>I know a place that everyone says is really unspoiled.</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER 1</P>
</b></B><P>I heard they built a big hotel there.</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER 5</P>
</b></B><P>Some sort of sewage problem, apparently.</P>
<b><B><P>TRAVELER 1</P>
</b></B><P>We're going anyway: all the rooms have got air conditioning.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>But for me it's all about finding out something about a place, and something about yourself. And when you get off the beaten track, that's where you find out what there is to find out.</P>
<I><P>Richard turns into one of the restaurants.</P></OL>

<b><OL START=4>
</b><b></I><LI>INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The restaurant extends deeply back away from the street. Richard passes many diners not dissimilar to himself. Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video entertainment.</P>
<P>At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack.</P>
<P>A Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She immediately shows Richard a "menu" of available rooms. The menu offers a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom.</P>
<P>Richard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht.</P>
<P>The Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at.</P>
<P>A worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard. This is Daffy.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Good evening.</P>
<I><P>Daffy says nothing but continues to stare and takes a drink.</P>
<P>Richard will not be stared down. Neither turns away.</P>
<P>The Receptionist passes over a key and smiles broadly.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HOTEL RECEPTIONIST</P>
</b></B><P>Welcome to Thailand.</P>
<I><P>Richard turns to her.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Thank you.</P></OL>

<b><OL START=5>
</b><b><P><LI> INT SHOWER. NIGHT</P></LI>
</b><I><P>In a small windowless shower room, Richard stands motionless, eyes closed, facing with pleasure the spray of cold water.</P></OL>

<b><OL START=6>
</b><b></I><LI>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT</LI>
</b><I><P>The sound of the shower can be heard through a door marked with a shower sign.</P>
<P>The sound stops and the door is opened. Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag.</P>
<P>He walks the short distance to his room. He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor.</P>
<P>While he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard.</P>
<P>There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle.</P>
<P>Richard turns to the source of the whistle.</P>
<P>A beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is Francoise. She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle.</P>
<b></I><P>FRANCOIS</P>
</b><P>Et voila.</P>
<I><P>The door swings gently open. She stands back</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Thank you.</P>
<I><P>Footsteps approach from the stair.</P>
<P>Francoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with her. He nods at Richard as he takes her arm. They walk away from Richard to the next door.</P>
<b></I><B><P>FRANCOISE</P>
</b></B><P>Bonsoir.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Eh - bonsoir.</P>
<b><B><P>ETIENNE</P>
</b></B><P>Goodnight.</P>
<I><P>The couple reach their door. They enter their room and the door is closed behind them.</P>
<P>Alone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>I was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.</P></OL>

<b><OL START=7>
</b><b><LI>INT RESTAURANT. NIGHT</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard is in the restaurant which is quiet now.</P>
<P>He is alone at a table eating and drinking. On a high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and explosions, plays on the television.</P>
<P>Most of the tables around him are empty.</P>
<P>Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him.</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Excuse me.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Yes?</P>
<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>I'm Daffy.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Richard. Hi.</P>
<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Help you out?</P>
<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>I'm sorry, I don't think so.</P>
<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.</P>
<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Just five dollars, please.</P>
<I><P>He leans in close to Richard</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>I'll share something with you.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.</P>
<I><P>Daffy retreats.</P>
<P>Richard turns back to the video and his food.</P>
<P>Daffy approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table.</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Excuse me, ladies, is there any chance you could help me out. I'm down on my luck at the moment.</P>
<I><P>The two young women seem uncomfortable. Richard notices.</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>if you could see your way to lending me some cash -</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Here.</P>
<I><P>He leans across and holds out a ten dollar note for Daffy.</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Just take it, OK.</P>
<I><P>Daffy takes it.</P>
<P>Richard returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected on his face.</P> </OL>

<b><OL START=8>
</b><b></I><LI>INT. <B>RICHARD</B>'S HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>Some light enters from the street through a small window.</P>
<P>Richard lies on his bed, watching the fan rotate above him.</P>
<P>He is listening to the sound of Etienne and Francoise engaging in noisy sex. They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.</P>
<P>Richard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in the other</I> <I>direction. It is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above Richard's head and shouting in time.</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</B> (O.S.)</P>
</b><P>Have. You. Got. Anything. To. Smoke.</P>
<P>Have. You. Got. Anything. To. -</P></OL>

<b><OL START=9>
</b><b><LI>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard knocks sharply on the door of Daffy's room.</P>
<P>The door is opened immediately by Daffy, looking even worse then before.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>No, I don't have anything to smoke.</P>
<I><P>Daffy stares at him for a moment. Recognition dawns.</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>You. You're the guy that lent me the money.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.</P>
<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -</P>
<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>

<P>Been nice knowing you.</P>
<I><P>He sticks his hand out.</P>
<P>Richard politely reciprocates.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>

<P>A few strokes later he hears a short sharp scream from Francoise.</P>

<P>Richard wanders a short distance away.</P>
<P>Something glinting on the ground catches Richard's eye. He leans down and picks it up. It is an empty brass cartridge from a rifle. Richard looks around.</P>
<P>Just ahead he sees the remains of an extinguished campfire, and beyond that, protruding from the undergrowth, a pair of male legs and beyond them, the butt of a rifle.</P>
<P>CLOSE IN on the nest in the undergrowth. The legs and gun belong to a Farmer. He is asleep. His physique is strong and his skin weathered.</P>
<P>Richard turns back to Etienne and Francoise. They are still strolling amongst the plants.</P>

<P>The longhouse is single story building made from wood and bamboo lattice, about thirty meters long. It is divided up by low partitions into single or double sleeping areas, some of which are personalized, others not. There is also an open area where this action takes place.</P>

</b><I><P>Richard enters the tunnel, passing from the light into the dark.</P>
<P>He enters near total darkness.</P>
<P>Far ahead is a narrow point of dim light.</P>
<P>He swims towards it.</P>
<b></I><LI>INT CAVE. DAY.</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard surfaces, breathing deeply.  He is in a cave within the cliffs, from which a small entrance opens on to the sea beyond.</P>
<P>Within the cave is a large flat rock and moored beside that is a small narrow boat with an outboard motor.</P>
<P>The ceiling of the cave is high and opening into it is a chimney (which will be in use later).  Additional light enters through this.</P>
<P>As Richard surfaces, Sal is already in the boat.</P>

<b><LI>EXT. BEACH RESORT. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The street is lined with bars each pumping out western music on its own sound system.</P>
<P>Richard and Sal walk along the strip.</P>
<P>They turn towards a bungalow complex.  Sal is still carrying the parcel of dope.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>- I couldn't be bothered.  It all seemed kind of trashy and out of place.  This was why we kept the secret.  If these assholes ever found out about our island they'd take just one night to spoil it forever.</P>
<b><LI>EXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The reception area is covered by an awning.  An old warped pool table stands in the center.  Sal and the receptionist, SUMET, greet each other and speak in Thai.  There are no subtitles but when they discus sthe number of rooms they indicate with their fingers: this is not seen by Richard.</P>

<b><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>I phoned home and discovered that I couldn't communicate.  I realized that I was no longer the person they knew.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>You don't understand.</P>
<I><P>He hangs up.</P>
<P>He steps out of the booth.  On the other side of the store are racks of patterned shirts and hats.</P>
<P>Richard walks across and stares just beyond them.</P>
<P>He is looking in a mirror, at himself, tanned and weathere-beaten.</P>
<b></I><LI>INT.SUPERMARKET. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard browses, selecting the items on his list, then spending time choosing soap, eventually opting for a brand marked "Genuine French Soap".</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>In fact the more I thought about it the more I realized that none of this world made any sense to me.  I'd left it behind.  We all had, and in its place we'd found somewhere special, and we were determined to keep it that way.</P>
<I><P>He drops the "French" soap in his basket.</P>
<b></I><LI>EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The music is far away now.  Richard and Sal struggle along the deserted beach to their boat carrying a pallet laden with sacks of rice.</P>
</I><P>They arrive and drop the pallet.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Now I understand why no one wants to come for the rice.</P>
<b><P>INT/ EXT. BAR. NIGHT.</P>
</b><I><P>The bar opens out to a street just back from the beach.  It is busy.</P>
<P>Sal and Richard stand at the bar with their drinks.</P>
<b></I><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>So how does it feel to be back in the world?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>It's not like I remembered it.</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>It gets worse every time.</P>
<I><P>A hand rests on Richard's shoulder, gently pushing him aside to create space at the bar.  It is Zeph.</P>
<b></I><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>Excuse me, please.</P>
<I><P>He does not see Richard's face but concentrates on the barman.</P>
<P>Richard recognizes him and conceals his face.</P>
<b></I><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>Excuse me!  Four beers please.  Heinneken.</P>
<I><P>The barman serves him.</P>
<P>Sammy and two German girls stand behind Zeph.  He passes the drink back to them and turns to speak.</P>
<P>Richard and Sal listen in.</P>
<b></I><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>(Continuing)</P>
<P>OK, where was I?</P>
<b><B><P>SAMMY</P>
</b></B><P>The beach.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>Right, the beach: it's on this secret island, in the middle of the national park where no one is allowed to go.  It's paradise.</P>
<b><B><P>GIRL 1</P>
</b></B><P>Sounds cool.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>What's even better is we got the map of how to get there.</P>
<b><B><P>GIRL 1</P>
</b></B><P>Can we see it?</P>
<b><B><P>SAMMY</P>
</b></B><P>Sure.  Let's go back to our place.  We can smoke some dope, drink some beer, loosen off these tight clothes we're wearing, then check out the map.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>But hey it's secret - if we show you the map, you have to come with us.</P>
<I><P>They laugh.  Zeph and Sammy high-five each other.</P>
<b></I><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>Back in a minute.  Just going to conduct a recon of the local sanitation facility.</P>
<I><P>Richard watches him leave the bar.</P>
<b></I><LI>EXT. TOILET. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The toilet is a narrow concrete passage with a ditch along the bottom on one side.  There is no roof but a single light above.</P>
<P>Zeph is just finishing as he notices Richard.</P>
<b></I><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>Hey, Richard! I hardly fucking recognize you. Where have you been?  The beach?  Tell me - it's paradise.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>There is no beach.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>What?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>The map is wrong.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>You've been?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>No. it's dangerous.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>Danger - hey, you're calling my middle name.  What kind of danger?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Doesn't matter.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>I think you're trying to put me off.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>I'm just telling you, for your own good: stay away.  Don't go. Don't even try.  Just forget it.</P>
<b><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>We'll do whatever we want.</P>
<I><P>He goes to leave.  Richard places a hand on his chest.  They stop for a moment.  Zeph pushes the hand away.</P>
<b></I><B><P>ZEPH</P>
</b></B><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>Fuck you.</P>
<I><P>Zeph walks past then turns back.</P>

<P>Stay away from the mushrooms, Richard, they make you paranoid.</P>
<b><LI>EXT. BECH / STEPS. NIGHT.</LI>

<b></I><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>That idiot Daffy? What was he doing - handing out Xerox copies to every asshole in Thailand?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Yeah, it's unbelievable.</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>Why? That's all I want to know. Why?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>I don't know, Sal.</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>Pardon me for this, but thank Christ he's dead.</P>
<b><LI>EXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard and Sal enter from the steps.  Behind them the party is still in progress.</P>
<P>Sal approaches the desk while Richard hangs back.</P>
<P>She greets Sumet who hands over one key.</P>
<b></I><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>Bad news.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>What?</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>She gave away your room.  She thought we were - you know - together.  Sorry.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Right.  Great.  Well I'll go find somewhere else then.  I'll meet you back here in the morning.</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>Richard.</P>
<I><P>She shows him the key for the room.</P>
<P>They look at each other.</P>
<b></I><B><P>SAL</B> </P>
</b><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>I'm going to play a couple of games of pool with Sumet.</P>
<I><P>She throws the key.  He catches.</P>
<b></I><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>Why don't you go warm the bed?</P>
<b><LI>INT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The room is in darkness.  Moonlight penetrates the threadbare curtain.  The bed is surrounded by a mosquito net.</P>
<P>The music from the beach party is audible.</P>
<P>Just visible through the net is the outline of two human forms entwined.</P>
<b></I><LI>EXT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>Lizards scuttle across the small porch.</P>
<b></I><LI>INT. BED. NIGHT.</LI>

<P>Sal lies on her side falling asleep. Richard is awake.</P>

</b></B><P>Sal.</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>Uh-huh.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Can I ask you a question?</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>It was great.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>No, it's not that.  I just wondered about Bugs.  And me.</P>
<I><P>Sal rouses herself.</P>
<b></I><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>OK, it's like this. Bugs is my boyfriend, my partner, and you, you're someone I just screwed.  Is that ok?</P>
<I><P>She turns on her side again.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>That's fine.  That's absolutely fine.</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>
</b></B><P>Good, now get some sleep - I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.</P>
<b><LI>EXT. BEACH. DAY.</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard and Sal push the boat into the water and away from the beach, jumping on board as they do so.</P>
<b></I><LI>EXT. SEA/CLIFFS. DAY.</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard and Sal approach the outer cliffs of the sea-wall in the boat.  Richard looks up.</P>
<P>Bugs is standing at the top of the cliff, directly above the cave.</P>
<b></I><LI>INT CAVE. DAY.</LI>
</b><I><P>The sacks of rice are now contained in a net being hauled upwards on a rope towards and into the chimney which rises out of the ceiling.</P>
<P>Sal swims away into the tunnel.</P>
<b></I><LI>EXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY.</LI>
</b><I><P>Bugs and Keaty haul the rice up with the aid of a block and tackle.</P>
<b></I><LI>INT. CAVE. DAY.</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard is alone as he looks up the chimney and watches the cargo disappear the last few feet to the top of the cliff.</P>
<P>As it reaches the top it is swung aside and Bugs looks down.</P>
<P>Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the chimney.</P>
<P>Richard casually clutches his groin and thrusts once.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>Screwing Sal was pretty good but screwing Bugs - that was even better.</P>
<b><LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The longhouse is full of inhabitants.</P>
<P>Richard walks the length of the hut like Santa Claus despensing toiletries and other gifts as requested.</P>
<P>He reaches Francoise alone at the end of the hut.</P>
<P>He gives her the "French" soap.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>For you.</P>
<b><B><P>FRANCOISE</P>
</b></B><P>I missed you.</P>

</b></B><P>Ohfine.  Listen, do you want to go to the beach?</P>
<b><B><P>FRANCOISE</P>
</b></B><P>I can't.  Meet me tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock at the waterfall.</P>
<I><P>She touches him as she walks away.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>I didnt' feel as bad as I should have about all this.  In fact I didn't really feel bad at all.  What happened on Ko Pha Ngan was different, it didn't count.</P>
<b><LI>EXT. FOREST/WATERFALL. DAY.</LI>
</b>
<I><P>Richard is on his way to the waterfall.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><I><P>And I was glad to be back.  Now I really did understand why no one wanted to go for the rice.  Life here was so good that</I> <I>going back to the world we came from could only bring you down.</P>
<P>He reaches the area by the waterfall and stands waiting.  He looks around for Francoise: no sign. He checks his watch: a few minutes to ten.</P>
<b></I><B><P>SAL</B> (O.S.)</P>
</b><P>Hi there, Richard.</P>
<I><P>Richard turns to see Sal, who has appeared as though from nowhere.</P>

</b></B><P>Oh, Sal.  Hi.</P>
<b><B><P>SAL</P>

<I><P>Richard checks his watch.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>

  Francoise, Etienne, Sal, Bugs, Keaty, etc.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>And then I couldn't understand why I'd never come up before. I got a whole 
  new perspective. They were ants, or rats in an experiment, but up here I 
  wasn't part of it, I was free. I could do whatever I wanted. This was my 
  personal adventure playground. There was even a bunch of local bad guys I 
  could fool around with.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Looking through the trees, the four dope farmers (with their guns) are 
  visible about thirty meters away, relaxing and playing cards.</P>
  <P>Richard appears in a tree, hiding from their view, if they cared to 
  look.</P>
  <P>He steals forward to another tree. He watches them.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>Pretty soon, I was starring in my very own war movie. It was Vietnam 1968, 
  or at least about as close to it as I would ever get, considering I was born 
  in 1973. But I knew exactly who I was: renegade special forces officer on a 
  solo mission, search and destroy. I liked the sound of it "he prefers to work 
  alone," they'd say, "he's got the stare."</P><I>
  <P>The farmers are oblivious.</P>
  <P>Richard advances as far as he dare: a few meters from them.</P>
  <P>He peers at them around the edge of the tree.</P>
  <P>He notices that the one nearest has left a knife on the ground.</P>
  <P>Richard lifts a stone and throws it high in the air beyond the farmers.</P>
  <P>As it falls through the trees to the forest floor the farmers are startled. 
  They stand and turn away towards the noise reaching for their guns, cocking 
  them, etc.</P>
  <P>The knife is taken by Richard.</P>
  <P>The farmers see a bird fly from a tree. Satisfied, they give up and return 
  to their resting place.</P>
  <P>Richard steals away from tree to tree.</P>
  <P>The farmer cannot understand where his knife has gone.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. DAY <I>
</b>  <P>Richard sits in a hollow under a rough shelter he as made from palm 
  leaves.</P>
  <P>He is using the knife to gut a bird of some sort which he then eats 
  raw.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I hadn't entirely forgotten my purpose up here, but I wasn't worried about 
  it. I mean I didn't want one of those bastards turning up with my map sticking 
  out of his pocket, but if they did, it was going to be a challenge. It was a 
  mission, my mission, to defend our island.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard watches the empty beach.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>The only hitch was - the enemy didn't show up. Now it was probably a 
  mistake, but I one day I brought Francoise up. I thought I'd show her 
  around.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. DAY <I>
</b>  <P>Richard struggles through dense undergrowth, followed by 
  Francoise.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Come on, just through here. Watch out for the thorns. Here: look.</P><I>
  <P>Beneath a tree, a few rotting logs are topped off with palm 
  leaves.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>(continuing)</P>
  <P>Well, what do you think?</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>What is it?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>It's a shelter. I built it. I thought we could move up here. Get away from 
  it all.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>We?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Yeah. You'll need to tell Etienne, of course but - </P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard, it's horrible.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Primitive, yes, but you have to accept some limitation when you go for 
  seclusion like this.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>And to eat?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Whatever I kill, we'll eat.</P><I>
  <P>Francoise laughs.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Enjoy yourself, Richard. I'll see you later, back in civilizatin.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Do you want a mushroom?</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>What?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>They grow here, all over the place. I picked some. Here.</P><I>
  <P>Richard collects a handful from under the shelter.</P>
  <P>Francoise does not think this is funny.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>No thanks.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Please yourself.</P><I>
  <P>He swallows one.</P>
  <P>Francoise turns away. She struggles back through the undergrowth.</P>
  <P>Richard watches her. He swallows a handful of mushrooms.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Close up: a caterpillar crawls along a green leaf.</P>
  <P>Richard, his pupils dilated, is watching, transfixed.</P>
  <P>He holds the knife at the end of the leaf.</P>
  <P>The caterpillar crawls on to the blade.</P>
  <P>Richard sticks his tongue out and swivels the blade around.</P>
  <P>The caterpillar crawls on to his tongue.</P>
  <P>Richard gently closes his mouth.</P>
  <P>He swallows.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>When you're a highly trained combat machine, you can't allow yourself to be 
  distracted by minor problems in your personal life. And you can't sit around, 
  you have to stay active, otherwise your energy will dissipate. You have to 
  feed the fear.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT/DAWN. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard, his face disrupted by mud, sneaks towards the rough shelter of 
  wooden planks and palm leaves under which the four farmers are 
  sleeping.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. EXT. SHELTER. NIGHT/DAWN. <I>
</b>  <P>The shelter is several meters long but shallow and is open down the length 
  of one side.</P>
  <P>This is the farmers' home on the island.</P>
  <P>It contains a collection of tools, arms, crates, bedding, food, cigarettes, 
  and bottles of cheap whiskey.</P>
  <P>Spaced out within the shelter, the four farmers are asleep on low pallets 
  or mats on the ground, each with their gun by their side.</P>
  <P>Richard enters the shelter and surveys the scene.</P>
  <P>He approaches the nearest farmer who lies asleep. He is wearing a bandana 
  which has slipped half off in his sleep.</P>
  <P>Very slowly, Richard reaches down and lifts the farmer's gun, a 
  Kalashnikov-type assult rifle.</P>
  <P>Richard holds the weapon, becoming comfortable with it.</P>
  <P>He lifts the butt to his shoulder and squints down the sight.</P>
  <P>He closes in on the farmer, so close that the muzzle is almost tickling the 
  farmer's nose.</P>
  <P>In his sleep, the farmer swats at his nose as he might swat at a fly. 
  Richard withdraws the gun a fraction.</P>
  <P>His finger strokes the trigger.</P>
  <P>He moves very carefully around the shelter, pointing the gun at each 
  sleeping farmer and mouthing "bang" as he goes.</P>
  <P>He returns to the first farmer and kneels beside him.</P>
  <P>The farmer is on his side, facing away from Richard. He stirs in his sleep 
  and wakes slightly.</P>
  <P>He reaches out behind him to feel for his gun. His hand feels the metal. He 
  relaxes and closes his eyes again.</P>
  <P>Behind him, Richard smiles and releases his own grip on the gun.</P>
  <P>Instead he lifts the bandana away from the farmer's head and puts it on his 
  own.</P>
  <P>Now he produces the knife from the back of his shorts.</P>
  <P>He kneels beside the farmer and holds the knife firmly.</P>
  <P>Abruptly he stabs it into the upright wooden plank behind the farmer's 
  head.</P>
  <P>The blade sinks deep into the wood.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. WATERFALL. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard screams as he executes an exhibition dive from the top of the 
  waterfall to the pool below.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. BEACH. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>There is no one on the beach apart from Richard.</P>
  <P>He walks to the water and dives in.</P>
  <P>He surfaces and faces the sun.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I was ecstatic. In a fair contest I had infiltrated their command and left 
  my mark. I had fulfilled my potential as a warrior, a soldier, a killer on the 
  loose. I could just imagine them trying to work how the missing knife got 
  home.</P><I>
  <P>Christo, Sten, and Karl appear walking down the beach with their fishing 
  gear as Richard walks in from the water.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Hi, guys.</P><B>
<b>  <P>CHRISTO</P></B>
</b>  <P>Hello Richard.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I couldn't wait to tell Francoise about it.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard's face is slapped twice by Francoise's hand.</P>
  <P>They are standing in a small clearing not far from the longhouse.</P>
  <P>Francoise raises her hand to slap him again. He retreats a 
  fraction.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Do you want to calm down? I'm trying to tell you about something exciting. 
  I'm trying to share it with you and all you can do is freak out because you 
  don't like where I want to live.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>I don't care about that.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>No? Still pissed about the mushrooms. You know Francoise, sometimes you are 
  so uptight.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>You liked to me. About Sal.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Oh, that. She told you?</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>She told everyone. She believes in openness and honesty, not like 
  you.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Come on, you were two-timing Etienne.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Because I liked you. I didn't know you were going to screw Sal twenty-four 
  hours later.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Well if you're going to make such a big deal out of it -</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Bugs is going to kill you. And you know what - I don't care.</P><I>
  <P>She raises her hand and slaps him again.</P>
  <P>Richard does not flinch.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard enters the longhouse.</P>
  <P>Inside are several people, including Bugs, sitting at the far end.</P>
  <P>When they see that it is Richard, all conversation stops.</P>
  <P>One by one at first, then en masse, everyone except Bugs leaves the 
  longhouse, hurrying past Richard at the door.</P>
  <P>Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the longhouse.</P>
  <P>Richard smiles. He repeats the gesture that he made when returning with the 
  rice: he clutches his groin and thrusts towards Bugs.</P>
  <P>Bugs starts running towards Richard.</P>
  <P>Just as Bugs reaches him he takes evasive action, feinting to one side.</P>
  <P>Bugs, cursing, pursues Richard around the longhouse, each of them trampling 
  over possessions and partitions. Bugs is bigger but Richard is too sly and 
  nimble for him, taunting and mocking as he dodges around the narrow upright 
  supports that run down the middle of the building.</P>
  <P>Eventually Bugs has Richard cornered.</P>
  <P>They face each other, crouched slightly, breathing heavily.</P>
  <P>From outside a loud, horrified screaming begins.</P>
  <P>It carries on and on.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Don't you think we ought to go see what the problem is?</P><I>
  <P>Bugs pauses for a moment. He glances towards the door for a fraction of a 
  second.</P>
  <P>Richard slugs him in the jaw.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. CLEARING. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard emerges from the longhouse, flexing the fingers of his punching 
  hand.</P>
  <P>A crowd has gathered as he joins it.</P>
  <P>At the center are Karl, on his knees, wailing and shouting in Swedish, and 
  Sten, who has been savaged by a shark and looks dead. Despite his appearance, 
  Keaty and Gregorio are attempting to resuscitate him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>Poor Karl: he didn't speak much English, but he only needed one 
word.</P><B>
<b>  <P>KARL</P></B>
</b>  <P>Shark! Shark!</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>They were trying to save Sten's life although even as a novice in this 
  field I could tell that just wasn't going to happen.</P><I>
  <P>Richard backs away.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. BEACH. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard walks along the shore and begins to follow a bloodstained furrow in 
  the sand.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>The way I saw it, sharks live in the sea, so if you go swimming where they 
  live, they might eat you. That's what sharks are good at, that's what they do. 
  I could have explained this to Christo but I just knew he wouldn't see 
  it.</P><I>
  <P>Richard is standing over Christo who is lying in agony on the 
  sand.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>CHRISTO</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard! My foot. My foot! It's so painful. My foot!</P><I>
  <P>Richard looks at Christo's right leg: it has been bitten off beneath the 
  knee, leaving only a ragged bloody stump.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Yeah, your foot - it's - pretty bad.</P><I>
  <P>Christo clings to him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>CHRISTO</P></B>
</b>  <P>But it will be ok? Please Richard, when I get to the hospital?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Hospital?</P><B>
<b>  <P>CHRISTO</P></B>
</b>  <P>Tell me - it will be ok.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Yeah. Sure. Christo, it'll be ok.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. GRAVE STIE. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>A freshly dug grave in sandy soil about 1.5 meters deep.</P>
  <P>The corpse (Sten) in a sleeping bag is slung into the grave, its feet 
  protruding from the end.</P>
  <P>Immediately, the earth starts to be filled in from either side.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>KEATY</B> (O.S.)</P>
</b>  <P>We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Sten. I couldn't 
  claim to know the bloke all that well but what I knew, I liked. He was a 
  straightforward, easy to get along with, reliable sort of guy. He worked hard 
  for the whole community - he even lost his life fishing for us.</P><I>
  <P>Keaty is addressing the entire community beside the grave while earth is 
  heaped on.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>KEATY</P></B>
</b>  <P>He made an effort to join in whatever was going on. For example, he played 
  cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm that belied his Nordic origins, and I 
  think we can see that as a symbolic ofhis place amongst us in a wider sense. 
  Anyway, he wasn't one for long speeches, and neither am I. May God take you 
  soul, and you shall rest forever in peace mate. We'll miss you.</P><I>
  <P>Keaty holds back a tear as he throws a flower in the grave.</P>
  <P>Others throw flowers in.</P>
  <P>Bugs hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Christo is being nursed by Etienne who is mopping his brow, trying to get 
  him to drink etc.</P>
  <P>Several people are sitting around, inactive and silent.</P>
  <P>Christo moans. A couple of people get up and leave.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>After the funeral we all tried to get back to normal, but it just didn't 
  seem right. After a while it became clear that the problem was Christo. You 
  see, in a shark attack, or any other major tragedy I guess, the important 
  thing is to get eaten and die, in which case there's a funeral and someone 
  makes a speech and everyone cries and says what a good guy you were, or: get 
  better in which case everyone can forget about it. It's the hanging around in 
  between that really pisses people off.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Etienne is backing through the forest. Outraged.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>This is disgusting! You cannot do this! Take him back!</P><I>
  <P>A party of stretcher bearers, including Bugs, Sal, and Keaty, carry Christo 
  through the forest. Sal is carrying a small rolled up tent. Richard walks 
  behind.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>Ok, that's far enough.</P><I>
  <P>They lower Christo to the ground.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Take him back, you fucking animals!</P><I>
  <P>Sal drops the tent at Etienne's feet.</P>
  <P>The part walks away apart from Richard</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>(continuing)</P>
  <P>Fucking bastards!</P>
<b>  <LI>INT. SMALL TENT. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Christo, delirious, is being nursed by Etienne in the small tent, now 
  situated in the middle of the forest.</P>
  <P>Richard is with him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>It's not that they don't care, Etienne, it's just that they don't care in 
  the same way as you do. It's a fine distinction, I know.</P><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>I understand: they wish he was dead.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>No! they've be equally happy if he recovered. They just want an 
  outcome.</P><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>He needs a doctor.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>You worked in a hospital.</P><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>For one month, as a cleaner, a domestic.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Well that's one month longer than anyone else around here. Look, you're 
  doing your best for the guy. No one could ask for more. Everyone apprecaites 
  that.</P><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Look, Richard!</P><I>
  <P>Etienne draws back the sheet covering Christo's discolored stump.</P></I>
  <P>Richard recoils.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Jesus!</P><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>It's gangrene. It's spreading. He needs an amputation.</P><I>
  <P>Etienne produces a knife from his possessions.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>You're going to do it here?</P><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Where else?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>OK! I'll hold him still.</P><I>
  <P>Etienne prepares to proceed, but at the last moment he cannot.</P>
  <P>He drops the knife</P>
  <P>Richard relaxes.</P></LI></OL>

<b>  <LI>EXT. BEACH. DAY. 
</b>  <P>People are playing and relaxing on the beach and in the water, shouting and 
  swimming.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>It would be a lot easier to condemn our behavior if it hadn't been so 
  effective, but out of sight really was out of mind. The bad smell was gone - 
  it was like we had amputated Christo from our community and after the 
  operation was over, we felt a whole lot better.</P><I>

</b>  <P>Hey, relax, just a joke. What's wrong with you?</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>No, what's wrong with you? Why didn't you stop them moving Christo?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Francoise I just thought we ought to spend some time together. We haven't 
  had a chance to talk, and let's face it, it's going to be a lot easier for us 
  to do that if Etienne isn't hanging around the longhouse.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>

</b>  <P>Richard flits thorough the trees until he can see the shore.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. BEACH. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>The travelers on their raft come ashore.</P>
  <P>They consult their map then move into the forest.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard watches them as they ascend the slope to the dope field.</P>
  <P>In the other direction, hidden from the travelers perspective, he notices 
  the four farmers sitting at their shelter eating breakfast.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FIELD. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>The travelers, watched by Richard, reach the top of the slope and then the 
  edge of the field.</P>
  <P>The farmers are nearby.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>If I was going to warn them, then now was the time to do it. All I had to 
  do was walk out and tell them not to make any noise I could lead them to 
  safety. I could persuade them to go. I could threaten them. If the worst came 
  to the worst, I could lead them to the camp and we could kick the shit out of 
  them, then send them home. But I didn't want to do any of those things. I 
  wanted to see what would happen.</P><I>
  <P>Zeph, Sammy, and the German girls are jubilant.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>SAMMY</P></B>
</b>  <P>We are in dope heaven. There is no other explanation.</P><B>
<b>  <P>ZEPH</P></B>
</b>  <P>(singing)</P>
  <P>I smoke two joints in the morning. I smoke two joints at night. I smoke two 
  joints in the afternoon and then I feel alright. I smoke two joints in time of 
  peace and two in time of war. I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and 
  then -</P><I>
  <P>Zeph stops singing. He has seen the farmers, armed and watching him from a 
  few meters away.</P>
  <P>Sammy and the others also notice, one by one. They too stand still, dumb 
  and frightened.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>ZEPH</P></B>
</b>  <P>Hi.</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAMMY</P></B>
</b>  <P>Shit.</P><B>
<b>  <P>ZEPH</P></B>
</b>  <P>We're Americans. Tourists. But we will leave. We made a mistake. We go now. 
  We take nothing.</P><I>
  <P>Slowly, he begins to walk backwards, smiling reassuringly.</P>
  <P>The farmers say nothing but advance and outflank the travelers, herding 
  them back into a huddle.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>ZEPH</P></B>
</b>  <P>(continuing)</P>
  <P>We go now. We leave in peace. Look we can pay. Here, American dollars. You 
  can have them.</P><I>
  <P>The farmers line up opposite them.</P>
  <P>All begin to plead desperately for their lives.</P>
  <P>One of the German girls suddenly breaks away and starts running in the 
  direction of Richard's hiding place. </P>
  <P>One of the guards shoots at her repeatedly, missing.</P>
  <P>The others start shooting at the remaining three, cutting them down in a 
  hail of bullets.</P>
  <P>The German girl keeps on running, zigzagging as she goes.</P>
  <P>The farmers fire but miss.</P>
  <P>She reaches the place where Richard is hiding, couched down in the 
  undergrowth.</P>
  <P>Startled by seeing him, she stops abruptly.</P>
  <P>Richard and the German girl stare into each other's eyes for a moment.</P>
  <P>Suddenly her chest explodes forwards as a single bullet rips through from 
  her back.</P>
  <P>She falls to the ground.</P>
  <P>Richard is spattered in her blood.</P>
  <P>He sits motionless, staring at her corpse.</P></I>
<b>  <P>UNDERWATER. DAY.</P><I>
</b>  <P>In the pool at the base of the waterfall. It is empty.</P>
  <P>Richard appears, submerging at the speed from his jump.</P>
  <P>He sinks then floats slowly towards the surface, eyes open.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. POOL. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard climbs from the pool.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>So that was it. Now I knew exactly what would happen. I wouldn't need to 
  wonder aobut it any longer.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard walks across the deserted clearing towards the light of the 
  longhouse.</P>
  <P>Around him, a wind begins to blow.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LOONGHOUSE. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>The longhouse is full. Everyone is there, apart from Etienne and Francoise, 
  engaged in quiet conversation.</P>
  <P>Richard is hardly noticed as he sits down.</P>
  <P>A few seconds later, Sal sits opposite him. She is absolutely matter of 
  fact.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>Well?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>They're dead.</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>All of them?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Yes, all of them. They disturbed the farmers.</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>Right.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>I guess that means we don't need to worry about them any more.</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>Yeah. The only problem we have left is Francoise and Etienne.</P><I>
  <P>Richard realizes what she means.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>You knew they'd be killed.</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>It's not the first time.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>And Daffy?</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>What?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Daffy. He saw it happen. Didn't he? Yea, he saw it happen. And now you 
  wanted me to see it happen.</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard, if you're going to live here, you've got to get involved.</P><I>
  <P>Richard's knife (the stolen one) is lying beside him. Sal picks it up by 
  the tip of the blade.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>(continuing)</P>
  <P>Francoise. And Etienne.</P><I>
  <P>She slaps the knife into Richard's hand.</P>
  <P>She stands up and walks away.</P>
  <P>Richard contemplates the knife.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>A storm is building up, scattering anything loose across the 
  clearing.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Most of the lights are out now. The wind is beginning to rattle the 
  building.</P>
  <P>Richard lies awake.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I wasn't thinking about what she asked me to do.</P>
<b>  <LI>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard and Daffy shake hands.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I was trying to remember somewhere I used to call home, someone I used to 
  be, but I couldn't put a name to that place or a face to that person anymore - 
  they got left behind in a hotel room in the Khao San Road along with a man who 
  cut his wrists.</P>
<b>  <LI>INT. DAFFY'S ROOM. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard steps carefully across the floor, avoiding the pools of 
  blood.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>But at least I understood why he'd done it.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>It is pouring rain and the storm grows stronger.</P>
  <P>Richard appears alone in the clearing, the knife in his hadn.</P>
  <P>Thunder and lightening begin.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I still didn't know what I was going to do when I got to them. You see, 
  when you have blood on your hands, you ask yourself, what difference will it 
  make if you spill some more? I had made a sacrifice to keep the secret, and 
  now that sacrifice was the secret.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard approaches the faint glow of the small tent where Francoise is 
  nursing christo.</P>
  <P>He is carrying the knife.</P>
  <P>He crawls close up to the tent. Etienne is sleeping in the open 
  doorway.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Inside there is darkness while all are sleeping.</P>
  <P>The thunder is directly overhead and the lightening flashes frequently.</P>
  <P>Sonja stirs in her sleep.</P>
  <P>In a flash of lightening she thinks she sees something.</P>
  <P>A whole series of flashes provide a clearer view.</P>
  <P>At the end of her bed four corpses, Zeph, Sammy, and the two German girls, 
  hang upside down and bound together from the central beam in the roof of the 
  building.</P>
  <P>Zeph appears to be staring at her, his hair trailing against her feet.</P>
  <P>She screams.</P>
  <P>More lightening illuminates the four armed Farmers.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard crawls towards the sleeping Etienne.</P>
  <P>Inside the tent, Francoise has her back to the entrance as she mops the 
  brow of Christo, feverish and unconscious.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>The farmers have torches now.</P>
  <P>One of them is interrogating Sal angrily in Thai while the other 
  inhabitants cower at gunpoint.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>FARMER</P></B>
</b>  <P>You draw maps! You bring people here! Why?</P><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>No, we don't. We bring no one.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FARMER</P></B>
</b>  <P>You are lying! You are bringing people here. Too many people!</P><I>
  <P>He hits her with the rifle butt.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>SAL</P></B>
</b>  <P>No, I promise, we keep it secret. We tell no one.</P><I>
  <P>He hits her again.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>FARMER</P></B>
</b>  <P>Then who drew this?</P><I>
  <P>He holds out the map drawn by Richard.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard draws closer to Etienne. He reaches him, the knife poised in his 
  hand.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>The four bodies hang from the roof.</P>
  <P>The farmers have gone.</P>
  <P>Sal lies injured on the floor.</P>
  <P>The inhabitants silently pass the map from one to the other.</P>
  <P>It reaches Bugs last. He studies it.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard's bald is at Etienne's throat.</P>
  <P>He opens his eyes, frozen with fear.</P>
  <P>Richard is aware of a gaze from another direction. Keeping the knife at 
  Etienne's throat, he turns to see that Francoise is looking at him. They stare 
  at each other.</P>
  <P>Richard takes the knife away.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>You have to leave. Do you understand? You have to leave right now. If you 
  don't they'll kill you.</P><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>What about Christo?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>There is nothing more you can do. I'll look after him.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard -</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>You don't have time to talk about this. You have to go now.</P><I>
  <P>Christo moans. Etienne looks at him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>(continuing)</P>
  <P>Leave him with me.</P><I>
  <P>Etienne understands. He and Richard stare at each other.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Bugs runs through the forest, away from the lights of the clearing.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Francoise and Etienne flee through the forest towards the beach.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. SMALL TENT. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard studies Christo, illuminated by a torch.</P>
  <P>His breathing is labored and irregular.</P>
  <P>Richard reaches forward. He pinches Christo's nose and covers his 
mouth.</P>
  <P>Christo's body struggles briefly and goes still.</P>
  <P>Richard relaxes his grip.</P>
  <P>He switches off the torch.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. LAGOON. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard swims out from the beach.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. LAGOON/CLIFFS. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard swims out towards the cliff.</P>
  <P>He reaches the cliff and pauses, taking a deep breath before submerging 
  towards the underwater tunnel.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. CAVE. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Moonlight reflects in through the chimney and the entrance.</P>
  <P>Etienne and Francoise are in the boat.</P>
  <P>Etienne is trying to start the boat.</P>
  <P>He sees the silhouette of a man surface and crawl onto the flat rock.</P>
  <P>Etienne steps off the boat onto the rock as the figure in the shadows 
  approaches him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard, come one, get into the boat.</P><I>
  <P>The man pulls Etienne forward and stabs him deep into his 
  abdomen.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>(continuing)</P>
  <P>Richard!</P><I>
  <P>It is Bugs.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>BUGS</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard can't help you now, French boy.</P><I>
  <P>Francoise screams.</P>
  <P>Bugs releases Etienne who falls helpless to his knees.</P>
  <P>Bugs turns his attention to Francoise. She pulls the start cord and the 
  engine starts.</P>
  <P>Bugs holds one end of the mooring rope, pulling the boat towards him while 
  Francoise tries to undo the other end.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (O.S.)</P>
</b>  <P>Hey, Bugs!</P><I>
  <P>Richard stands on the rock.</P>
  <P>Bugs turns towards him. He drops the rope and walks a couple of paces, then 
  rushes him.</P>
  <P>Richard manages to avoid the blade.</P>
  <P>They fight.</P>
  <P>Bugs forces Richard on to the ground</P>
  <P>He is about to stab Richard.</P>
  <P>Etienne appears behind Bugs, struggling on his feet, bleeding from his 
  wound.</P>
  <P>He is holding a piece of rope. He slings it around Bug's neck.</P>
  <P>Etienne's eyes roll and his head lolls.</P>
  <P>He falls back into the water, pulling Bugs with him.</P>
<b>  <P>UNDERWATER. NIGHT.</P>
</b>  <P>Etienne and the struggling Bugs sink.</P>
  <P>Bugs cannot free himslf, becoming only more entangled.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. CAVE. NIGHT <I>
</b>  <P>Richard lies on the flat rock.</P>
  <P>Francoise is in the boat.</P>
  <P>She switches off the engine.</P>
<b>  <P>UNDERWATER. NIGHT.</P>
</b>  <P>Etienne and Bugs lie at rest on the sea bed.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. SEA. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>A calm sunny day.</P>
  <P>Richard and Francoise are on the boat, drifting.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>That was the worst thing: I didn't even get to die. I had to live with 
  myself.</P>
<b>  <LI>INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>In a typical Khao San Road hotel. The room is a mess.</P>
  <P>Richard disheveled and haggard is sitting at a small table, working with a 
  pencil and a piece of paper.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I haven't seen her since and I don't suppose I ever will. I've been here 
  six months now.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. CLEARING. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>The clearing is deserted and overgrown.</P>
  <P>The longhouse is derelict and overrun with creepers.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. ISLAND. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>From above in one rising shot, the beach, the lagoon, and the 
  island.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>Listening to all the people talk about where they're going to go and ho 
  great it's going to be, and I try to tell them: you can go too far, you can 
  find out too much, but no one ever listens, no one ever listens. I guess 
  there's some things you just have to discover for yourself.</P>
<b>  <LI>INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>He finishes his work. It is a copy of The Map.</P>
  <P>He picks up a single tack.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard pins the map to the door of an adjacent room.</P>
  <P>He walks back to the open door of his own room.</P>
  <P>He looks back once and closes the door.</P>
  <P>Close on The Map.</P></LI></OL></I>
