</b>




                                   Written by

                                   Allan Loeb




<b>          A BLACK SCREEN
</b>          Onto which is written in white letters...

          "When business in the United States underwent a
          contraction... the Federal Reserve created more paper
          reserves.

          The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a
          fantastic speculative boom... "



<b>          EXT. CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY
</b>
          It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement.
          A cab waits in the lot.

          The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's
          group of newly released emerge.

          They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to
          reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002.
          Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel.
          And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko.

          But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that
          gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a
          very different version of the man we remember... because now
          there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read
          anyway.

          And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently
          freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting
          with the people who waited for them... the people who love
          them.

          The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait
          a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot...
          waiting for his people... but they don't come.

          And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat...
          completely disappointed... and completely alone.
          And we...

<b>          SLAM BACK INTO
</b>          As the white letters reappear on the screen...
          "As a result... the American economy collapsed...
          Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929...
          ... written by Alan Greenspan."

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.)
</b>           It's funny, the more we find ourselves
           slaves of chance... the more
           superstitious we become.

</b>           And that would make Andrew Zabel one
           superstitious motherfucker.

          Find ANDREW ZABEL, mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           He started every day the same exact
           way. He would walk his dogs then
           leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven
           am on the dot.

          As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive
          building made of white stone.
          Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           And he would take an umbrella with him
           even when there was no chance of
           rain...

          As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a
          familiar nod. And without saying a word, the clerk knows
          exactly what to give him.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate
           Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland
           Springs water.

<b>          23RD ST SUBWAY STATION
</b>          As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate...

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           He had timed it out so he wouldn't
           have to wait more than three minutes
           for the uptown five train.

          As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight
          from the 5 train coming down the tunnel.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           I guess you could say that day was
           like every other...

          And as the train approaches... holding that Wall Street
          Journal... the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids...

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Except for one thing...

          ... Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the
          track.

<b>           3.

          And as the train SLAMS into US...

<b>                         DARKNESS
</b>          Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then...
          "Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen... and we move down
          below the letters to find...

<b>                         A CHART
</b>          Now filling the screen. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial
          Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the
          right... not good.
          A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back
          three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and
          Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out...
          CARD: JUNE 6th 2008... 8 DAYS EARLIER...

<b>                         MIDTOWN
</b>          Opening titles... the workplace throng... listening to their
          iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their
          Starbucks.

          Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the
          opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers
          building... with that giant ticker that rounds the building
          posting Dow 12,579.76 -- +119.86

          And keep moving... all is normal in the financial center of
          the universe.

          Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel
          then climb up it to the top... to the penthouse office
          suites.

          And push in through the window to be in...

<b>          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/ANDREW ZABEL'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          An impressive office with a 180 degree view of southern
          Manhattan. Zabel sits behind his desk.

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           Go ahead, open it.
          And across from Andrew Zabel sits JACOB L. MOORE... who holds
          his bonus check.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Really?
          On the wall over Zabel's shoulder runs an electronic ticker
          with the major indices and just one stock... ticker KZI...
          Keller Zabel Investments.

<b>           4.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           I thought that because of the problems
           with the credi--

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           Screw the credit derivative desk, I
           don't understand half the shit they do
           anyway.
          Zabel forces a smile. But Jacob can tell something's wrong
          with him.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Are you okay?
          Zabel doesn't answer... he just nods to the envelope.

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           Open it.
          He opens the envelope and looks down at the check.
          $1,450,000. And he can barely contain his excitement.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Thank you.
          And we get a good look at Jacob now... boyish features that
          display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in.
          He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely
          winning.

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           I'm proud of you, Jacob.
          And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the
          electronic ticker on the wall... 12,592.46 -- +132.46... KZI

           Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a

          Diego cracks up. Jacob just shakes his head and moves on.
          And Jacob walks uptown... deep in thought. It's a gorgeous
          June Friday.
          Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a
          long moment... coming to a decision.
          And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way...

          Some laughter from the room.

<b>                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
</b>           He graduated from City College in 1966
           and became a securities broker at
           Hudson River Bank then moved on to
           Smith Barney. In 1973 he went out on
           his own to establish a spectacular
           career as a independent trader then an
           active participant in the LBO craze of
           the 1980s.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           In 1988, he was indicted for insider
           trading and then charged with other
           various forms of securities fraud and
           IRS violations. In one of the most
           harshest sentences ever given to a
           white collar criminal... he served
           fourteen years in a maximum security
           prison and he wants me to stress that
           it was not a country club.
          Again laughter from the floor.

<b>                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Since his release in 2002, he has
           written and has spoken publicly about
           what he refers to as the current state

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           What's not funny is what's happening

           it. And I know the financial center
           of the world doesn't get it... which
           happens to be Washington DC now.
          As he takes to a pace...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           To understand where we are, we need to
           understand how we got here. No good
           deed goes unpunished, all fires start
           with a well meaning spark and we
           wanted Americans to be able to afford
           homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try
           to get the middle and lower classes
           into homes they can own. So we made
           money cheap and lowered restrictions
           on mortgage lending.
          As he takes a moment and looks over the room...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Somebody reminded me the other night
           that I once said "greed is good." I
           swear I don't remember it but it
           sounds like something I would say in
           the Eighties.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           And I was right then. Greed was good.
           America needed greed and risk-taking
           and leverage to get to become the
           superpower we are... or were. And
           capitalism needed greed and risk and
           leverage to become the economic
           platform it has become... but those
           same attributes that got us there are
           now the liabilities that threaten to
           destroy us.
          Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it. He has a text.
          "KZI!!! -- wtf?"

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           So greed has been redefined. Who
           knows -- maybe it was always like this
           and like everything else in this
           world, it's good and it is evil.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Because people -- it's greed that
           caused someone who aspires to own a
           seven-hundred thousand dollar house
           they can't afford, to take on a loan
           they'll never be able to pay back...
           and it's greed that caused their
           mortgage lender to give them that loan
           then sell it right away... and it's
           greed that caused the buyer of that
           loan to slice it into a million little
           pieces then spit them all over the
           world... and it's greed that caused
           the rating agency to give that toxic
           loan a triple-A rating just because it
           was mixed in with some good loans...
           and it's greed that caused the
           insurance company to insure that loan.

           so don't you find it curious that she
           would fall in love with you?
          And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat.
          Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.

</b>           It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't

          Gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard.
          Jacob notices a picture of Winnie in the wallet.

          Gordon shrugs and shows the picture to Jacob.
          It's of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a
          gorgeous white horse.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO

          Gordon sighs, takes the picture out of his wallet and hands
          it to Jacob.

          fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass
          featuring that park view on the other.
          And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a
          recital of some sort.
          About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very
          unique looking silver grand piano.

          Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"... her fingers gliding across the
          keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's
          as spectacular as it is moving.
          Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All
          ethnicities and types...
          The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST
          with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his

          refined, composed and masculine.
          He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at
          Jacob. Jacob looks away.
          And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata
          to applause.
          The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton
          heads over to Jacob.

          He's a hedge fund type, real SLICK, reminds us of Gekko

          No doubt about it, this is a nice place. Worth three million
          dollars, maybe four at the beginning of the year.
          Sparsely decorated. Large framed photographs line the walls.
          Gordon shows Jacob pictures of Winnie's childhood.

          As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec
          1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to the

<b>                          JACOB

          Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from
          the early 1900s.
          It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. One of
          the men is Uncle Sam dressed in US flag colors. But Sam's
          very small in this cartoon... can't really row the boat.
          The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy
          rowing. He is...

           stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping
           in and buying up shares in all the
           companies that were crashing.
           Everyone else quickly followed like
           lemmings.
           (re political cartoon)
           See -- people had stopped looking to
           their government or trusted advisors.
           They looked to JP Morgan. It was all
           about simple psychology -- every crash
           should have a JP Morgan to step in and
           save it.
          As they walk the hardwood floor...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           See Jacob... the best opportunities
           are found where angels fear to tread.
          And they arrive at the next piece on the wall... a small
          framed bond.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           That's a bond issued by the Central

</b>           But be cautious. Your relationship

          And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him
          into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the

</b>           It's complicated but like Bretton said
           -- right now there are more
           opportunities than ever.

          Jacob sleeps. There's a knock on his door. He stirs. The
          knock's louder. Then... Jacob finally wakes, moves to the
          door and opens it to see...
          TWO BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN WOMEN, PAULINA and NADIA

<b>                          NADIA

          ... past the empty bottle of champagne...

<b>           NADIA (O.S.)
</b>           How about there? I bet you want me to
           do it there.

<b>           JACOB (O.S.)
</b>           No... I want you to hold it.

</b>           I know... but if you're going to

</b>           Good advice for everything... no?
          Her friend agrees with a laugh. And Jacob checks the clock.

<b>                          JACOB

          Jacob opens the door to let them go but he hears a door open
          across the hall... Bretton's.
          And they all witness a YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN leave Bretton's
          room then head down the hall right by them.
          Jacob's stunned.

<b>                          PAULINA

          Pull back to be on Perezhilton.com
          Jacob Moore sits in front of his computer. And he turns to
          Paulina.

<b>                          JACOB

<b>                          PAULINA

<b>                          NADIA

           of trying to master them.

          just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a
          race.
          Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.
          As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only
          narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and
          revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton
          as they approach the trail.
          If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton,
          he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't.
          Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed,
          narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling
          ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           Really Gordon? Do you really need

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Since I have forty-four seconds to
           spare, I'm going to tell you a story.
           It's about a guy named Sam.
          And we go close on Gekko...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Sam used to work a job, he made things
           and he grew things and he sold those
           things. Until one day Sam got a
           credit card and was amazed how easy it
           was to buy things with it. So Sam got
           another card and then another. Then
           he used the credit card money to make
           it look like he had an income... and
           he used that "income" to secure a
           loan.

<b>                          (MORE)

<b>           92.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           And with that loan Sam bought a fancy
           BMW car and rented a fancy penthouse
           apartment.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Now, the credit cards hit their limit
           and the bank needed him to service
           that loan, so Sam went to his friends.
           His Chinese friend... and his Japanese
           friend... and his British friend and
           so on. And his friends loaned Sam
           money.

<b>                          (ANOTHER BEAT)
</b>           And that brings us to today... where
           Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes
           the banks and Sam owes his friends and
           eventually they're going to take away
           Sam's fancy BMW car and his fancy
           penthouse apartment.
          And Jacob can now see... in Gordon Gekko's eyes... he truly
          believes every word he's saying.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           And Sam doesn't make anything anymore
           and Sam doesn't grow anything anymore
           so Sam doesn't sell anything anymore.
          As he stands...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           I'd go and sit with him sometimes.
           We'd eat ice cream.

           arrived aboard the S.S. Vancouver in
           Boston. He had two dollars and fifty
           cents to his name. Yet just a few

           would revert back to their pre-trust
           posture and regulations.

           it all amounts to the same thing...
           loss of control. And it's always
           going to be there and it's always
           going to be stronger than you, Pal.
          Now walking again...

<b>           122.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           It's why bubbles will always exist and
           it's why we're all currently in this
           mess.
          Joining Gordon's stride...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Winnie's pregnant.
          And Gordon stops walking.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           It's going to be a boy.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           What do you want?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           It's bad out there, Gordon, people are
           panicked. They're not looking to
           their government. They're not looking
           to their trusted advisors. They're
           looking to you.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           You want me to buy?
          And Jacob Moore... slowly confirming...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Publicly and aggressively.
          Gordon just looks at him.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           But they're all lemmings. Simple
           psychology. You once said every crash
           should have a JP Morgan to step in and
           save it.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Well Gordon -- this is your chance to
           be JP Morgan.
          And now Gordon shakes his head...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           We're far from the bottom. It'll be a
           dead cat bounce.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           It'll buy us time. That's all I'm
           asking for... time.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Time for the new administration to put
           their plan into action.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           What do I get in return?

<b>           123.
</b>
                         

                         
          As Gordon turns... takes in the city of Dubai... in all of
          its ridiculous splendor...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Full clemency.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           You can offer that?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Your daughter can. She works with the
           new Secretary of Treasury now.
          Considering that...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           What else?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Winnie. Me. Your grandson.
           Something money can't buy... a family.
          And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it
          all to register, then...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I
           cannot make.
          And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore
          behind...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           You wanna know what the mother of all
           bubbles was? Us. The human race.
           Scientists call it the Cambrian
           Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna.

<b>          AND RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT
</b>          As Jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see Winnie
          waiting for him...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           It happened 530 million years ago...
           when all of the sudden, there was the
           seemingly rapid appearance of most
           major groups of complex animals.
          And as they embrace...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           And from it was born humanity.

<b>          AND GORDON GEKKO
</b>          Being led through a massive empty space... office space...

<b>           124.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           It was an explosion of life.
           Scientists will tell you it was
           unprecedented, excessive and by the
           standards of evolution-time...
           happened in a flash.
          The City of London outside the large windows...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Suddenly the world had millions of new
           species... just like that.
          This will be the home of his new international empire.

<b>          AND BRETTON WOODS
</b>          At his desk in his 15 CPW penthouse...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           See -- bubbles are the purest form of
           Darwinism.
          ... looking over pages and pages of destruction... Andrew
          Zabel's legacy that he now has to pay for...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           They teach us what we didn't know and
           they remind us of what we forgot...
          And Bretton completely loses it... just starts ripping out
          the pages then tearing them in two...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           They kill excess and they lean out the
           herd.
          ... methodically... page by page... over and over again...

<b>          AND GORDON GEKKO
</b>          Sitting in his massive London office.
          It's empty. It's night. He's completely alone.
          He looks up at the wall... at the framed picture of JP Morgan
          and Uncle Sam rowing that boat.
          Then he looks down at an old picture of Winnie... she's
          probably three or four years old... and lovingly holding her
          baby brother, Rudy.

          And Gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before
          finally...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           They actually bring us back to the
           necessary simple...

<b>           125.
</b>
                         

                         
          ... picking up the phone.

<b>          AND GORDON GEKKO
</b>          Now in the back of a Town Car... we don't know where...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Because Jacob...
          As the door opens, daylight spills in and we see the charging
          bull of Bowling Green Park across the way...
          Gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the
          New York stock exchange.
          And Gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard
          the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's
          welcome and finally... opens the doors then disappears
          inside.

<b>          AND WINNIE AND JACOB
</b>          Greet the morning in their small Washington DC apartment.
          Winnie pouring coffee, Jacob turning on the TV.
          And on the screen is a picture of Gordon Gekko walking the
          floor of the New York stock exchange under the graphic...
          "Gekko Now Betting On A Recovery."

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           ... you'd be amazed what can rise from
           the ashes.

          Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" kicks in.
          And we go close on the Fox Business Channel's coverage of the
          market's huge rally of an opening... with Gordon Gekko
          ringing the bell... until the channel suddenly changes... to
          the cartoon network... while we...

<b>           FADE OUT.
