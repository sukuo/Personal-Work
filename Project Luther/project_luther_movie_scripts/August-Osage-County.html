<b>                       AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY
</b>


                           Written by

                          Tracy Letts



<b>1   AN ENDLESS SKY AT TWILIGHT                                  1
</b>
    Foreboding. Heat lightning in the distance. Miles of
    unforgiving, summer-scorched prairie.

<b>                        BEVERLY (OS)
</b>              ..."Life is very long..."


<b>2   MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD                                      2
</b>
    Two lanes, not a car in sight. Cracked asphalt undulates over
    gentle, browned hills, disappears into an infinite horizon.

<b>                        BEVERLY (OS)
</b>              TS Eliot. Not the first person to say
              it, certainly not the first person to
              think it.


<b>3   A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK                                3
</b>
    Flat, still. An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly,
    tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock.

<b>                        BEVERLY (OS)
</b>              But he's given credit for it because
              he bothered to write it down.


<b>4   AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL                   4
</b>
    At the end of a long gravel road.   Surrounded by towering
    black walnuts and lace-bark elms.   A farm once, no one's put
    a plow to earth here in decades.

<b>                        BEVERLY (OS)
</b>              So if you say it, you have to say his
              name after it. "Life is very long:" TS
              Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right.

    Wrap around porches, forgotten gardens. Imposing in the
    gathering gloom. A single downstairs window glows.

<b>                        BEVERLY (OS) (CONT'D)
</b>              Give the devil his due. Very few
              poets could've made it through Eliot's
              trial and come out, brilliantined and
              double-breasted and Anglican.

</b>
    And now, a face fills the screen --


<b>5   INT. BEVERLY'S DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT                     5
</b>
    BEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.    We take
    a long moment, just to study that face.

<b>                           BEVERLY
</b>                 Not hard to imagine, faced with
                 Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how
                 Crane or Berryman might have reacted,
                 just foot-raced to the nearest bridge;
                 Olympian Suicidalists.

    Stares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon.

<b>                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)
</b>                 Not Eliot: after sufficient years of
                 ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the
                 nearest asylum and get on with it.

    He sits   at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses
    a glass   of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his
    careful   selection of words than drunkenness. He's talking to
    someone   we do not yet see.

<b>                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)
</b>                 God-a-mighty. You have to admire the
                 purity of the survivor's instinct.

    From somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling.

<b>                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)
</b>                 Violet. My wife. She takes pills,
                 sometimes a great many. They affect...
                 among other things, her equilibrium.
                 Fortunately, they eliminate her need
                 for equilibrium...


<b>6   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT                              6
</b>
    Full of shadows. She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets.
    We're on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint
    light from the open bathroom door. She hesitates on the edge
    of the bed, getting her bearings. Finds a pack of Winstons,
    lights one. Listens to the voices filtering up from below.
                         "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    3.


<b>7   INT. THE STUDY - TWILIGHT                                       7
</b>
    Beverly shifts, waiting for the sound of more movement from
    the rooms overhead. When there is none --

<b>                        BEVERLY
</b>              My wife takes pills and I drink.
              That's the bargain we've struck.

<b>                                                 INTERCUT WITH:
</b>

<b>8   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TWILIGHT               8
</b>
    She gathers herself to stand. Moves to the door. We FOLLOW
    HER CLOSELY. Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into --

<b>                        BEVERLY
</b>              The reasons why we partake are
              anymore inconsequential.

    The hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer
    ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters.

<b>                        BEVERLY (CONT'D)
</b>              The facts are: my wife takes pills and
              I drink. That's the bargain we've
              struck, just one paragraph of our
              marriage contract... cruel covenant.
              And these facts have over time made
              burdensome the maintenance of
              traditional American routine.

    She makes her way to the stairs starts down.

<b>                        BEVERLY (CONT'D)
</b>              Rather than once more vow abstinence
              with my fingers crossed in the queasy
              hope of righting our ship, I've chosen
              to turn my life over to a Higher Power
              and join the ranks of the Hiring
              Class.

    The light from the study slices across the living room.

<b>                        BEVERLY (CONT'D)
</b>              It's not a decision with which I'm
              entirely comfortable. I know how to
              launder my dirty undies. Done it all
              my life, but I'm finding it's getting
              in the way of my drinking.

    She can see a portion of Beverly's desk, a woman's legs.

<b>                           BEVERLY (CONT'D)
</b>                 Sorry about the heat in here. My wife
                 is cold-blooded and not just in the
                 metaphorical sense. She does not
                 believe in air-conditioning... as if
                 it is a thing to be disbelieved. I
                 knew your father, you know. Bought
                 many a watermelon from Mr Youngblood's
                 fruit stand. He did pass, didn't he??

</b>                 May I ask how?

<b>                           JOHNNA
</b>                 He had a heart attack. Fell into a
                 flatbed truck full of wine grapes.

<b>                           BEVERLY
</b>                 Wine grapes. In Oklahoma.   I'm sorry.

                 it... did. You. Are the police here?

<b>                             BEVERLY
</b>                 No...

    She stands in the shadows of the living room, confused.

<b>                           VIOLET
</b>                 Am I looking through window? A window?

<b>                           BEVERLY
</b>                 Can you come here?

    She steps into the study, emerging from the darkness into
    light to reveal: VIOLET WESTON. Dissipated, dishevelled,
    late sixties. She wears pajamas and a much slept-in robe.

<b>                             VIOLET
</b>                 Oh.    Hello.

    She's staring at a woman sitting in front of Beverly's desk:
    JOHNNA. Thirty, Native American, simply dressed.

     waits on the porch, late-forties, handsome, Stetson in hand.

     They go to him, but WE HANG BACK with Jean, watching the
     scene outside unfold. Bill shakes the Sheriff's hand. The
     Sheriff speaks earnestly to Barbara and Bill.

     We can't hear what's being said, only murmurs until --
     Barbara sinks to her knees. Bill holds her. Jean watches.

</b>                  One of those lies we tell to give us
                  comfort. Women are beautiful when
                  they're young and not after. Men can
                  still preserve their sex appeal into
                  old age. Not those men like you see
                  with shorts and those little purses
                  around their waists. Some men can
                  maintain a weary masculinity. Women
                  just get old and fat and wrinkly.

               hopeless. As if it had already
               happened. As if whatever was
               disappearing had already disappeared.

</b>
     The sun parched Indian grass and Turkey Toot are wilting but
     stirred by prairie winds. Bev's old Lincoln follows a thread
     of blacktop through the tall grass. Barb drives, Ivy up
     front. Karen's in the back with Violet.

     Barbara looks back, sees her mother means this literally,
     pulls to the side of the road. Violet gets out quickly.

     We stay with Barbara as she climbs out of the car, stares
     across the road, waiting for Violet, who can be heard
     retching. Karen and Ivy still in the car.

     The sound fades as Barbara contemplates the prairie and for a
     long moment... loses herself, back to this land, to her home.
     Her expression is unreadable, enigmatic.

     Then behind her, out of focus, we become aware of Violet
     running away, across the prairie, through the tall grass.

     Barbara turns, simply to get back in the car, sees Violet
     running through the field.

     Barbara takes off after her. Ivy and Karen climb out, but
     don't follow. Shield their eyes to watch the chase.

     It's an odd sight, the two women, racing through the grass.
     One almost seventy, the other nearing fifty.

     Barbara is slow in her pursuit at first, maybe because of her
     shoes, or maybe because she just feels silly. Then realizes
     that Violet is not stopping... not unless Barbara stops her.

     Violet runs through the tall grass, puts a foot wrong, goes
     down. Barbara catches up, out of breath, collapses. They
     lay on the ground, wheezing, sweating.

                  look at you and your sister and the

                  buried a man yesterday I loved very
                  much. And whatever faults he may have
                  had, he was a good, kind, decent
                  person. And to hear you tear into
                  your own son not even a day later
                  dishonors Beverly's memory. We've
                  been married thirty-eight years. I
                  wouldn't trade them for anything. But
                  if you can't find a generous place in
                  your heart for your own son, we're not
                  going to make it to thirty-nine.
